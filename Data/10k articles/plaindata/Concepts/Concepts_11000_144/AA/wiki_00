{"id": "35238282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35238282", "title": "Abstract cell complex", "text": "Abstract cell complex\n\nIn mathematics, an abstract cell complex is an abstract set with Alexandrov topology in which a non-negative integer number called dimension is assigned to each point. The complex is called “abstract” since its points, which are called “cells”, are not subsets of a Hausdorff space as it is the case in Euclidean and CW complex. Abstract cell complexes play an important role in image analysis and computer graphics.\n\nThe idea of abstract cell complexes (also named abstract cellular complexes) relates to J. Listing (1862) und E. Steinitz (1908). Also A.W Tucker (1933), K. Reidemeister (1938), P.S. Aleksandrov (1956) as well as R. Klette und A. Rosenfeld (2004) have described abstract cell complexes. E. Steinitz has defined an abstract cell complex as formula_1 where \"E\" is an abstract set, \"B\" is an asymmetric, irreflexive and transitive binary relation called the bounding relation among the elements of \"E\" and \"dim\" is a function assigning a non-negative integer to each element of \"E\" in such a way that if formula_2, then formula_3. \nV. Kovalevsky (1989) described abstract cell complexes for 3D and higher dimensions. He also suggested numerous applications to image analysis. In his book (2008) he has suggested an axiomatic theory of locally finite topological spaces which are generalization of abstract cell complexes. The book contains among others new definitions of topological balls and spheres independent of metric, a new definition of combinatorial manifolds and many algorithms useful for image analysis.\n\nThe topology of abstract cell complexes is based on a partial order in the set of its points or cells. \n\nThe notion of the abstract cell complex defined by E. Steinitz is related to the notion of an abstract simplicial complex and it differs from a simplicial complex by the property that its elements are no simplices: An \"n\"-dimensional element of an abstract complexes must not have \"n\"+1 zero-dimensional sides, and not each subset of the set of zero-dimensional sides of a cell is a cell. This is important since the notion of an abstract cell complexes can be applied to the two- and three-dimensional grids used in image processing, which is not true for simplicial complexes. A non-simplicial complex is a generalization which makes the introduction of cell coordinates possible: There are non-simplicial complexes which are Cartesian products of such \"linear\" one-dimensional complexes where each zero-dimensional cell, besides two of them, bounds exactly two one-dimensional cells. Only such Cartesian complexes make it possible to introduce such coordinates that each cell has a set of coordinates and any two different cells have different coordinate sets. The coordinate set can serve as a name of each cell of the complex which is important for processing complexes. \n\nAbstract complexes allow the introduction of classical topology (Alexandrov-topology) in grids being the basis of digital image processing. This possibility defines the great advantage of abstract cell complexes: It becomes possible to exactly define the notions of connectivity and of the boundary of subsets. The definition of dimension of cells and of complexes is in the general case different from that of simplicial complexes (see below).\n\nThe notion of an abstract cell complex differs essentially from that of a CW-complex because an abstract cell complex is no Hausdorff space. This is important from the point of view of computer science since it is impossible to explicitly represent a non-discrete Hausdorff space in a computer. (The neighborhood of each point in such a space must have infinitely many points). \n\nThe book by V. Kovalevsky contains the description of the theory of locally finite spaces which are a generalization of abstract cell complexes. A locally finite space \"S\" is a set of points where a subset of \"S\" is defined for each point \"P\" of \"S\". This subset containing a limited number of points is called the smallest neighborhood of \"P\". A binary neighborhood relation is defined in the set of points of the locally finite space \"S\": The element (point) \"b\" is in the neighborhood relation with the element \"a\" if \"b\" belongs to the smallest neighborhood of the element \"a\". New axioms of a locally finite space have been formulated, and it was proven that the space \"S\" is in accordance with the axioms only if the neighborhood relation is anti-symmetric and transitive. The neighborhood relation is the reflexive hull of the inverse bounding relation. It was shown that classical axioms of the topology can be deduced as theorems from the new axioms. Therefore, a locally finite space satisfying the new axioms is a particular case of a classical topological space. Its topology is a poset topology or Alexandrov topology.\nAn abstract cell complex is a particular case of a locally finite space in which the dimension is defined for each point. It was demonstrated that the dimension of a cell \"c\" of an abstract cell complex is equal to the length (number of cells minus 1) of the maximum bounding path leading from any cell of the complex to the cell \"c\". The bounding path is a sequence of cells in which each cell bounds the next one. The book contains the theory of digital straight segments in 2D complexes, numerous algorithms for tracing boundaries in 2D and 3D, for economically encoding the boundaries and for exactly reconstructing a subset from the code of its boundary.\n\nA digital image may be represented by a 2D Abstract Cell Complex (ACC) by decomposing the image into its ACC dimensional constituents: points (0-cell), cracks/edges (1-cell), and pixels/faces (2-cell).\nThis decomposition together with a coordinate assignment rule to unambiguously assign coordinates from the image pixels to the dimensional constituents permit certain image analysis operations to be carried out on the image with elegant algorithms such as crack boundary tracing, digital straight segment subdivision, etc. One such rule maps the points, cracks, and faces to the top left coordinate of the pixel. It should be noted that these dimensional constituents require no explicit translation into their own data structures but may be implicitly understood and related to the 2D array which is the usual data structure representation of a digital image. This coordinate assignment rule and the renderings of each cell incident to this image is depicted in the image at right.\n\n"}

This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some paranormal beliefs and practices, such as astrology, fortune telling, aura reading, and some types of personality tests.\n\nThese characterizations are often used by practitioners as a con-technique to convince victims that they are endowed with a paranormal gift. Because the assessment statements are so vague, people interpret their own meaning, thus the statement becomes \"personal\" to them. Also, individuals are more likely to accept negative assessments of themselves if they perceive the person presenting the assessment as a high-status professional.\n\nThe term \"Barnum effect\" was coined in 1956 by psychologist Paul Meehl in his essay \"Wanted – A Good Cookbook.\"\n\nThe Barnum effect is manifested in response to statements that are called \"Barnum statements\", meaning general characterisations attributed to an individual are perceived to be true of them, even though the statements are such generalizations, they could apply to almost anyone. Such techniques are used by fortune tellers, astrologers, and other practitioners of chicanery to convince paying customers that they, the practitioners, are in fact endowed with a paranormal gift. The effect is a specific example of the so-called \"acceptance phenomenon\", which describes the general tendency of humans \"to accept almost any bogus personality feedback\". A related and more general phenomenon is that of subjective validation. Subjective validation occurs when two unrelated or even random events are perceived to be related because a belief, expectation, or hypothesis demands a relationship. For example, while reading a horoscope, people actively seek a correspondence between its contents and their perception of their personality.\n\nIn 1947, a psychologist named Ross Stagner asked a number of personnel managers to take a personality test. After they had taken the test, Stagner, instead of responding with feedback based on their actual individual answers, presented each of them with generalized feedback that had no relation to their test answers but that was, instead, based on horoscopes, graphological analyses, and the like. Each of the managers was then asked how accurate the assessment of him or her was. More than half described the assessment as accurate, and almost none described it as wrong.\n\nIn 1948, in what has been described as a \"classic experiment\", psychologist Bertram R. Forer gave a psychology test—his so-called \"Diagnostic Interest Blank\"—to 39 of his psychology students who were told that they would each receive a brief personality vignette or sketch based on their test results. One week later Forer gave each student a purportedly individualized sketch and asked each of them to rate it on how well it applied. In reality, each student received the same sketch, consisting of the following items:\nOn average, the students rated its accuracy as 4.30 on a scale of 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent). Only after the ratings were turned in was it revealed that each student had received an identical sketch assembled by Forer from a newsstand astrology book. The sketch contains statements that are vague and general enough to apply to most people.\n\nThe Forer effect is also known as the \"Barnum effect\", a term coined in 1956 by American psychologist Paul Meehl in his essay \"Wanted—A Good Cookbook\", because he relates the vague personality descriptions used in certain \"pseudo-successful\" psychological tests to those given by showman P. T. Barnum.\n\nForer attributed the effect to gullibility. The effect has been said to confirm the so-called \"Pollyanna principle\", which states that individuals tend \"to use or accept positive words of feedback more frequently than negative words of feedback\".\n\nTwo factors are important in producing the Forer effect, according to the findings of replication studies. The content of the description offered is important, with specific emphasis on the ratio of positive to negative trait assessments. The other important factor is that the subject trusts the honesty of the person providing feedback. The study was repeated again in 2011 with the statements altered so that they applied to organizations rather than individuals. The results were similar, suggesting that people anthropomorphize organizations and are gullible when interpreting their characters.\n\nThe effect is consistently found when the assessment statements are vague. People are able to read their own meaning into the statements they receive, and thus the statement becomes \"personal\" to them. The most effective statements include the phrase \"at times\", such as \"At times you feel very sure of yourself, while at other times you are not as confident.\" This phrase can apply to almost anyone, and thus each person can read a \"personal\" meaning into it. Keeping statements vague in this manner ensures observing the Forer effect in replication studies.\n\nIndividuals are more likely to accept negative assessments of themselves if they perceive the persons presenting them with those assessments as high-status professionals. Evidence also suggests that people with authoritarian or neurotic personalities or who have a greater than usual need for approval are more likely to manifest the Barnum effect.\n\nStudies suggest that the Forer effect is universal—it has been observed in people from many cultures and locations. In 2009, psychologists Paul Rogers and Janice Soule conducted a study that compared the tendencies of Westerners to accept Barnum personality profiles to the tendencies of Chinese people. They were unable to find any significant differences.\n\nLater studies have found that subjects give higher accuracy ratings if the following are true:\n\nThe method in which the Barnum personality profiles are presented can affect the extent to which people accept them as their own. For instance, Barnum profiles that are more personalized—perhaps containing a specific person's name—are more likely to yield higher acceptability ratings than those that could be applied to anyone.\n\nSubjects who, for example, believe in the accuracy of horoscopes have a greater tendency to believe that the vague generalities of the response apply specifically to them. Studies on the relationship between mild symptoms of schizophrenia and susceptibility to the Forer effect have shown high amounts of correlation. However, Rogers and Soule's 2009 study (see \"Variables influencing the effect\" above) also tested subjects' astrological beliefs. Both the Chinese and Western skeptics were more likely to identify the ambiguity in the Barnum profiles.\n\nSelf-serving bias has been shown to cancel the Forer effect. According to the self-serving bias, subjects accept positive attributes about themselves while rejecting negative ones. In one study, subjects were given one of three personality reports: one consisting of Barnum profiles containing socially desirable personality traits, one containing a mixture of positive and negative traits, and the last containing profiles full of negative traits. (also called \"common faults\")\n\nSubjects who received the socially desirable and mixed reports were far more likely to agree with the personality assessments than the subjects who received negative reports, although there was not a significant difference between the first two groups.\n\nIn another study, subjects were given a list of traits instead of the usual \"fake\" personality assessment. The subjects were asked to rate how much they felt these traits applied to them. In line with the self-serving bias, the majority of subjects agreed with positive traits about themselves and disagreed with negative ones. The study concluded that the self-serving bias is powerful enough to cancel out the usual Forer effect.\n\nIn a 1971 experiment by Bernie I. Silverman, subjects were presented with twelve personality sketches drawn from a set of horoscopes and asked to choose the four that best described them. When the descriptions were not identified by astrological sign, subjects were not particularly likely to pick the horoscope for their own sign. When the descriptions were labeled by sign, however, subjects were more likely to pick the horoscope for their own sign.\n\nC. R. Snyder and R. J. Shenkel carried out a study in which they asked their students to prepare uniform Barnum descriptions for a group of subjects; these descriptions were then presented to study participants under the guise of being individualized horoscopes. Subjects in one group were not asked for personal information; those in a second group were asked to provided their month of birth; those in a third group were asked for the exact date of their birth. Those in the third group were most likely to say that their \"horoscopes\" applied to them; those in the first group were least likely to do so.\n\nIn 1977, Ray Hyman wrote about the way in which palm readers and other such hucksters exploit the Forer effect to take advantage of victims (or 'marks'). He provided a list of factors that help these tricksters to dupe their prey. For example, hucksters are more likely to be successful if they exude an air of confidence (\"If you look and act as if you believe in what you are doing, you will be able to sell even a bad reading to most of your subjects\"), if they \"[m]ake creative use of the latest statistical abstracts, polls, and surveys\" showing \"what various subclasses of our society believe, do, want, worry about, and so on\", if they employ \"a gimmick, such as a crystal ball, tarot cards, or palm reading\", if they are alert to the clues provided about their clients by such details as their \"clothing, jewelry, mannerisms and speech\", if they are not afraid of \"hamming it up\", and if they use flattery.\n\nMichael Birnbaum, a Professor of Psychology at California State University, Fullerton, has noted that the Forer effect is used by magicians and psychics when they give so-called \"cold readings\", as well as by certain TV personalities who claim psychoanalytical expertise and profess to be able to diagnose a guest's psychological problems in a few minutes. \"Real psychologists are horrified by this practice\", states Birnbaum, but they fail to criticize it vigorously enough in public, and so it continues to be treated with a respect it doesn't deserve. \"It is regrettable that academic psychology has not paid more attention to the cold reading technique,\" Denis Dutton wrote in 1988, \"inasmuch as the widespread practice of successful cold reading forms the basis for much of the belief in paranormal powers to be found in society today.\" While academic psychologists had focused in their studies on students, Dutton called for \"analysis of the actual techniques and methods used by proficient cold readers\".\n\nA 2016 article explained to marketers how to use the Forer effect to win customers. The main piece of advice was to employ flattery.\n\n\"The moral of the Barnum Demonstration\", Birnbaum has said, is that \"Self-validation is no validation. Do not be fooled by a psychic, quack psychotherapist, or a phony faith healer who uses this trick on you! Be skeptical and ask for proof. Keep your money in your wallet, your wallet in your pocket, and your hand on your wallet.\"\n\n\n"}

For this version the definitions of what it means to create coequalizers is changed slightly: the coequalizer has to be unique rather than just unique up to isomorphism.\n\nBeck's theorem is particularly important in its relation with the descent theory, which plays role in sheaf and stack theory, as well as in the Grothendieck's approach to algebraic geometry. Most cases of faithfully flat descent of algebraic structures (e.g. those in FGA and in SGA1) are special cases of Beck's theorem. The theorem gives an exact categorical description of the process of 'descent', at this level. In 1970 the Grothendieck approach via fibered categories and descent data was shown (by Bénabou and Roubaud) to be equivalent (under some conditions) to the comonad approach.

{"id": "2533237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2533237", "title": "Catalytic triad", "text": "Catalytic triad\n\nA catalytic triad is a set of three coordinated amino acids that can be found in the active site of some enzymes. Catalytic triads are most commonly found in hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to release the product and regenerate free enzyme. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine or even selenocysteine. The 3D structure of the enzyme brings together the triad residues in a precise orientation, even though they may be far apart in the sequence (primary structure).\n\nAs well as divergent evolution of function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show some of the best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies. Their mechanism of action is consequently one of the best studied in biochemistry.\n\nThe enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin were first purified in the 1930s. A serine in each of trypsin and chymotrypsin was identified as the catalytic nucleophile (by diisopropyl fluorophosphate modification) in the 1950s. The structure of chymotrypsin was solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1960s, showing the orientation of the catalytic triad in the active site. Other proteases were sequenced and aligned to reveal a family of related proteases, now called the S1 family. Simultaneously, the structures of the evolutionarily unrelated papain and subtilisin proteases were found to contain analogous triads. The 'charge-relay' mechanism for the activation of the nucleophile by the other triad members was proposed in the late 1960s. As more protease structures were solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1970s and 80s, homologous (such as TEV protease) and analogous (such as papain) triads were found. The MEROPS classification system in the 1990s and 2000s began classing proteases into structurally related enzyme superfamilies and so acts as a database of the convergent evolution of triads in over 20 superfamilies. Understanding how chemical constraints on evolution led to the convergence of so many enzyme families on the same triad geometries has developed in the 2010s.\n\nSince their initial discovery, there have been increasingly detailed investigations of their exact catalytic mechanism. Of particular contention in the 1990s and 2000s was whether low-barrier hydrogen bonding contributed to catalysis, or whether ordinary hydrogen bonding is sufficient to explain the mechanism. The massive body of work on the charge-relay, covalent catalysis used by catalytic triads has led to the mechanism being the best characterised in all of biochemistry.\n\nEnzymes that contain a catalytic triad use it for one of two reaction types: either to split a substrate (hydrolases) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate (transferases). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the active site of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. binding site and oxyanion hole) to achieve nucleophilic catalysis. These triad residues act together to make the nucleophile member highly reactive, generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.\n\nCatalytic triads perform covalent catalysis using a residue as a nucleophile. The reactivity of the nucleophilic residue is increased by the functional groups of the other triad members. The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.\n\nCatalysis is performed in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen to accept an electron, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxyanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting the first half of the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.\n\nThe second stage of catalysis is the resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.\n\nThe side-chain of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the substrate. The lone pair of electrons present on the oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive carbonyl carbon. The 20 naturally occurring biological amino acids do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult catalytic reactions. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the hydroxyl (OH) of serine and the thiol/thiolate ion (SH/S) of cysteine. Alternatively, threonine proteases use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine, however due to steric hindrance of the side chain's extra methyl group such proteases use their \"N\"-terminal amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.\n\nUse of oxygen or sulphur as the nucleophilic atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, allows it to form longer bonds (d and d by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower p\"K\" (by 5 units). Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its p\"K\" in order to achieve concerted deprotonation with catalysis. The low p\"K\" of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product. The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S. Sterically, the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.\n\nVery rarely, the selenium atom of the uncommon amino acid selenocysteine is used as a nucleophile. The deprotonated Se state is strongly favoured when in a catalytic triad.\n\nSince no natural amino acids are strongly nucleophilic, the base in a catalytic triad polarises and deprotonates the nucleophile to increase its reactivity. Additionally, it protonates the first product to aid leaving group departure.\n\nThe base is most commonly histidine since its p\"K\" allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's p\"K\" is so high (p\"K\"=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their \"N\"-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.\n\nThe acidic triad member forms a hydrogen bond with the basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) and so are the most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.\n\nThe Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif is one of the most thoroughly characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry. The triad is exemplified by chymotrypsin, a model serine protease from the PA superfamily which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the p\"K\" of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an oxyanion hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.\n\nThe same triad has also convergently evolved in α/β hydrolases such as some lipases and esterases, however orientation of the triad members is reversed. Additionally, brain acetyl hydrolase (which has the same fold as a small G-protein) has also been found to have this triad. The equivalent Ser-His-\"Glu \"triad is used in acetylcholinesterase.\n\nThe second most studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several families of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, with a few notable differences. Due to cysteine's low p\"K\", the importance of the Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as \"N\"-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.\n\nThe triad of cytomegalovirus protease uses histidine as both the acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to >10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.\n\nAn unusual triad is found in seldolisin proteases. The low p\"K\" of the glutamate carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad at very low pH. The triad is hypothesised to be an adaptation to specific environments like acidic hot springs (e.g. kumamolysin) or cell lysosome (e.g. tripeptidyl peptidase).\n\nThe endothelial protease vasohibin uses a cysteine as the nucleophile, but a serine to coordinate the histidine base. Despite the serine being a poor acid, it is still effective in orienting the histidine in the catalytic triad. Some homologues alternatively have a threonine instead of serine at the acid location.\n\nThreonine proteases, such as the proteasome protease subunit and ornithine acyltransferases use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine in a manner analogous to the use of the serine primary hydroxyl. However, due to the steric interference of the extra methyl group of threonine, the base member of the triad is the \"N\"-terminal amide which polarises an ordered water which, in turn, deprotonates the catalytic hydroxyl to increase its reactivity. Similarly, there exist equivalent 'serine only' and 'cysteine only' configurations such as penicillin acylase G and penicillin acylase V which are evolutionarily related to the proteasome proteases. Again, these use their \"N\"-terminal amide as a base.\n\nThis unusual triad occurs only in one superfamily of amidases. In this case, the lysine acts to polarise the middle serine. The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic serine to activate it (one with the side chain hydroxyl and the other with the backbone amide). The middle serine is held in an unusual \"cis\" orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues. The triad is further unusual in that the lysine and \"cis\"-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.\n\nThe rare, but naturally occurring amino acid selenocysteine (Sec), can also be found as the nucleophile in some catalytic triads. Selenocysteine is similar to cysteine, but contains a selenium atom instead of a sulphur. An example is in the active site of thioredoxin reductase, which uses the selenium for reduction of disulphide in thioredoxin.\n\nIn addition to naturally occurring types of catalytic triads, protein engineering has been used to create enzyme variants with non-native amino acids, or entirely synthetic amino acids. Catalytic triads have also been inserted into otherwise non-catalytic proteins, or protein mimics.\n\nSubtilisin (a serine protease) has had its oxygen nucleophile replaced with each of sulphur, selenium, or tellurium. Cysteine and selenocysteine were inserted by mutagenesis, whereas the non-natural amino acid, tellurocysteine, was inserted using auxotrophic cells fed with synthetic tellurocysteine. These elements are all in the 16th periodic table column (chalcogens), so have similar properties. In each case, changing the nucleophile reduced the enzyme's protease activity, but increased a different activity. A sulphur nucleophile improved the enzymes transferase activity (sometimes called subtiligase). Selenium and tellurium nucleophiles converted the enzyme into a oxidoreductase. When the nucleophile of TEV protease was converted from cysteine to serine, it protease activity was strongly reduced, but was able to be restored by directed evolution.\n\nNon-catalytic proteins have been used as scaffolds, having catalytic triads inserted into them which were then improved by directed evolution. The Ser-His-Asp triad has been inserted into an antibody, as well as a range of other proteins. Similarly, catalytic triad mimics have been created in small organic molecules like diaryl diselenide, and displayed on larger polymers like Merrifield resins, and self-assembling short peptide nanostructures.\n\nThe sophistication of the active site network causes residues involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to be highly evolutionarily conserved. However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis. The triad remains the core of the active site, but it is evolutionarily adapted to serve different functions. Some proteins, called pseudoenzymes, have non-catalytic functions (e.g. regulation by inhibitory binding) and have accumulated mutations that inactivate their catalytic triad.\n\nCatalytic triads perform covalent catalysis via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate is resolved by water, the result is hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a transferase. For example, attack by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate. In different members of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily, the Ser-His-Asp triad is tuned by surrounding residues to perform at least 17 different reactions. Some of these reactions are also achieved with mechanisms that have altered formation, or resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, or that don't proceed via an acyl-enzyme intermediate.\n\nAdditionally, an alternative transferase mechanism has been evolved by amidophosphoribosyltransferases, which has two active sites. In the first active site, a cysteine triad hydrolyses a glutamine substrate to release free ammonia. The ammonia then diffuses though an internal tunnel in the enzyme to the second active site, where it is transferred to a second substrate.\n\nDivergent evolution of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease superfamilies have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This can be inferred when a superfamily (with the same fold) contains families that use different nucleophiles. Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.\n\nWithin protease superfamilies that contain a mixture of nucleophiles (e.g. the PA clan), families are designated by their catalytic nucleophile (C=cysteine proteases, S=serine proteases).\nThe enzymology of proteases provides some of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of triad residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme superfamilies. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different structural fold. This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three triad residues, the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.\n\nThe same triad geometries been converged upon by serine proteases such as the chymotrypsin and subtilisin superfamilies. Similar convergent evolution has occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral C3 protease and papain superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.\n\nFamilies of Cysteine proteases\nFamilies of Serine proteases\nThreonine proteases use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary hydroxyl (i.e. has a methyl group). This methyl group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or histidine base. When the nucleophile of a serine protease was mutated to threonine, the methyl occupied a mixture of positions, most of which prevented substrate binding. Consequently, the catalytic residue of a threonine protease is located at it \"N\"-terminus.\n\nTwo evolutionarily independent enzyme superfamilies with different protein folds are known to use the \"N\"-terminal residue as a nucleophile: Superfamily PB (proteasomes using the Ntn fold) and Superfamily PE (acetyltransferases using the DOM fold) This commonality of active site structure in completely different protein folds indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those superfamilies.\n\nFamilies of threonine proteases\n"}

It was supposedly located somewhere in Patagonia, in a valley of the Andes between Chile and Argentina. Despite being searched for during the colonization of South America, no evidence proves that it ever existed, although reports of it circulated for two hundred years.

Its purported founders include survivors of a Spanish shipwreck in the Strait of Magellan, survivors in exile of the Disaster of Curalaba, ghosts, Patagonian giants and survivors of the Inca Empire; indeed, one explanation of the legend is that it derived from stories told to sailors by aborigines describing the Empire of Peru.\n\nCharles Sheffield's science fiction story \"Trapalanda\" (in \"Asimov's Science Fiction,\" June, 1987) is built around a quest to find Trapalanda.\n\n\n"}

Psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck laid the groundwork for the study of these distortions, and his student David D. Burns continued research on the topic. Burns, in \"The Feeling Good Handbook\" (1989), described personal and professional anecdotes related to cognitive distortions and their elimination.\n\nCognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately. According to the cognitive model of Beck, a negative outlook on reality, sometimes called \"negative schemas\" (or \"schemata\"), is a factor in symptoms of emotional dysfunction and poorer subjective well-being. Specifically, negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions. During difficult circumstances, these distorted thoughts can contribute to an overall negative outlook on the world and a depressive or anxious mental state.\n\nChallenging and changing cognitive distortions is a key element of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\n\nIn 1972, psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, and cognitive therapy scholar Aaron T. Beck published \"Depression: Causes and Treatment.\" He was dissatisfied with the conventional Freudian treatment of depression, because there was no empirical evidence for the success of Freudian psychoanalysis. Beck's book provided a comprehensive and empirically supported theoretical model for depression — its potential causes, symptoms, and treatments. In Chapter 2, titled \"Symptomatology of Depression,\" he described “cognitive manifestations” of depression, including low self-evaluation, negative expectations, self-blame and self-criticism, indecisiveness, and distortion of the body image.\n\nIn 1980 Burns published \"Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy\" (with a preface by Beck), and nine years later \"The Feeling Good Handbook\", both of which built on Beck's work.\n\nThe cognitive distortions listed below are categories of automatic thinking, and are to be distinguished from logical fallacies.\n\nBeing wrong is unthinkable. This cognitive distortion is characterized by actively trying to prove one's actions or thoughts to be correct, and sometimes prioritizing self-interest over the feelings of another person.\n\nThe opposite of \"personalization\"; holding other people responsible for the harm they cause, and especially for their intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n\nDiscounting positive events.\n\nPresuming that negative feelings expose the true nature of things and experiencing reality as a reflection of emotionally linked thoughts. Thinking something is true, solely based on a feeling.\n\nRelying on social control to obtain cooperative actions from another person.\n\nThis is the belief that life should be fair and produces upset or angry emotions when life is perceived as failing to be fair and breaking rules to even the playing field that leads to long term ramifications.\n\nFocusing entirely on negative elements of a situation to the exclusion of the positive. Also, the brain's tendency to filter information that does not conform to already-held beliefs.\n\nReaching preliminary conclusions (usually negative) with little (if any) evidence. Two specific subtypes are identified:\n\nA form of overgeneralization; attributing a person's actions to his or her character instead of to an attribute. Rather than assuming the behavior to be accidental or otherwise extrinsic, one assigns a label to someone or something that is based on the inferred character of that person or thing.\n\n\nGiving proportionally greater weight to a perceived failure, weakness or threat, or lesser weight to a perceived success, strength or opportunity, so that the weight differs from that assigned by others, such as \"making a mountain out of a molehill\". In depressed clients, often the positive characteristics of \"other people\" are exaggerated and their negative characteristics are understated.\n\nMaking hasty generalizations from insufficient evidence. Drawing a very broad conclusion from a single incident or a single piece of evidence. Even if something bad happens only once, it is expected to happen over and over again.\n\nAttributing personal responsibility, including the resulting praise or blame, to events over which the person has no control.\n\nMaking 'must' or should' statements was included by Albert Ellis in his rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), an early form of CBT; he termed it \"musturbation\". Michael C. Graham called it \"expecting the world to be different than it is\". It can be seen as demanding particular achievements or behaviours regardless of the realistic circumstances of the situation. \n\nA related cognitive distortion, also present in Ellis REBT, is a tendency to 'awfulize'; to say a future scenario will be 'awful', rather than to realistically appraise the various negative and positive characteristics of that scenario.\n\nEvaluating the self, as well as events in life in extreme terms. It's either all good or all bad, either black or white, nothing in between. Even small imperfections seem incredibly dangerous and painful.\nSplitting involves using terms like \"always\", \"every\" or \"never\" when they are false and misleading.\n\n\nCognitive restructuring (CR) is a popular form of therapy used to identify and reject maladaptive cognitive distortions and is typically used with individuals diagnosed with depression. In CR, the therapist and client first examine a stressful event or situation reported by the client. For example, a depressed male college student who experiences difficulty in dating might believe that his \"worthlessness\" causes women to reject him. Together, therapist and client might then create a more realistic cognition, e.g., \"It is within my control to ask girls on dates. However, even though there are some things I can do to influence their decisions, whether or not they say yes is largely out of my control. Thus, I am not responsible if they decline my invitation.\" CR therapies are designed to eliminate \"automatic thoughts\" that include clients' dysfunctional or negative views. According to Beck, doing so reduces feelings of worthlessness, anxiety, and anhedonia that are symptomatic of several forms of mental illness. CR is the main component of Beck's and Burns's cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nThose diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder tend to view themselves as unrealistically superior and overemphasize their strengths but understate their weaknesses. As such, narcissists use exaggeration and minimization to defend against psychic pain.\n\nIn cognitive therapy, decatastrophizing or decatastrophization is a cognitive restructuring technique that may be used to treat cognitive distortions, such as magnification and catastrophizing, commonly seen in psychological disorders like anxiety and psychosis. Major features of these disorders are the subjective report of being overwhelmed by life circumstances and the incapability of affecting them. The following statements are typical:\n\n\nThe goal of CR would be to help the client change his or her perceptions so as to render the felt experience as less significant. In the first example, the client's reported incapability would be reframed so that, although perhaps not all the work will be done by the deadline, the employee's sustained effort will make it unlikely that the boss will fire him or her.\n\nCommon criticisms of the diagnosis of cognitive distortion relate to epistemology and the theoretical basis. The implicit assumption behind the diagnosis is that the therapist is infallible and that only the world view of the therapist is correct. If the perceptions of the patient differ from those of the therapist, it may not be because of intellectual malfunctions but because the patient has different experiences. Critics claim that there is no evidence that patients suffering from e.g. depression have dysfunctional cognitive abilities. Actually, some depressed subjects appear to be “sadder but wiser”.\n"}
{"id": "374063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=374063", "title": "Compatibilism", "text": "Compatibilism\n\nCompatibilism is the belief that free will and determinism are mutually compatible and that it is possible to believe in both without being logically inconsistent. Compatibilists believe freedom can be present or absent in situations for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. They define free will as freedom to act according to one's motives without arbitrary hindrance from other individuals or institutions.\n\nFor example, courts of law make judgments, without bringing in metaphysics, about whether an individual was acting of their own free will in specific circumstances. It is assumed in a court of law that someone could have acted otherwise than in reality. Otherwise, no crime would have been committed.\n\nSimilarly, political liberty is a non-metaphysical concept. Statements of political liberty, such as the United States Bill of Rights, assume moral liberty: the ability to choose to do otherwise than one does.\n\nCompatibilism was championed by the ancient stoics and medieval scholastics (such as Thomas Aquinas), and by Enlightenment philosophers (like David Hume and Thomas Hobbes). More specifically, the scholastics, including Thomas Aquinas, rejected what would now be called \"incompatibilism\"—they held that humans could do otherwise than they do, otherwise the concept of sin is meaningless. As for the Jesuits, their concern was to reconcile the claim of God's foreknowledge of who would be saved with moral agency. The term \"compatibilism\" itself was coined as late as the 20th century. \n\nDuring the 20th century, compatibilists presented novel arguments that differed from the classical arguments of Hume, Hobbes, and John Stuart Mill. Importantly, Harry Frankfurt popularized what are now known as Frankfurt counterexamples to argue against incompatibilism, and developed a positive account of compatibilist free will based on higher-order volitions. Other \"new compatibilists\" include Gary Watson, Susan R. Wolf, P. F. Strawson, and R. Jay Wallace.\n\nContemporary compatibilists range from the philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett, particularly in his works \"Elbow Room\" (1984) and \"Freedom Evolves\" (2003), to the existentialist philosopher Frithjof Bergmann. Perhaps the most renowned contemporary defender of compatibilism is John Martin Fischer.\n\n\"Compatibilists\" often define an instance of \"free will\" as one in which the agent had freedom to act according to their own \"motivation\". That is, the agent was not coerced or restrained. Arthur Schopenhauer famously said, \"Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills.\"\n\nIn other words, although an agent may often be free to act according to a \"motive\", the nature of that motive is determined. Also note that this definition of free will does not rely on the truth or falsity of causal determinism. This view also makes \"free will\" close to \"autonomy\", the ability to live according to one's own rules, as opposed to being submitted to external domination.\n\nSome compatibilists will hold both causal determinism (all effects have causes) and logical determinism (the future is already determined) to be true. Thus statements about the future (e.g., \"it will rain tomorrow\") are either true or false when spoken today. This compatibilist free will should not be understood as some kind of ability to have actually chosen differently in an identical situation. A compatibilist can believe that a person can choose between many choices, but the choice is always determined by external factors. If the compatibilist says \"I may visit tomorrow, or I may not\", he is saying he does not know what he will choose—if he will choose to follow the subconscious urge to go or not.\n\nCritics of compatibilism often focus on the definition(s) of free will: incompatibilists may agree that the compatibilists are showing \"something\" to be compatible with determinism, but they think that \"something\" ought not to be called \"free will\". Incompatibilists might accept the \"freedom to act\" as a \"necessary\" criterion for free will, but doubt that it is \"sufficient\". Basically, they demand more of \"free will\". The incompatibilists believe free will refers to \"genuine\" (e.g., absolute, ultimate) alternate possibilities for beliefs, desires, or actions, rather than merely counterfactual ones.\n\nCompatibilism is sometimes called soft determinism pejoratively (William James' term). James accused them of creating a \"quagmire of evasion\" by stealing the name of freedom to mask their underlying determinism. Immanuel Kant called it a \"wretched subterfuge\" and \"word jugglery\". Kant's argument turns on the view that, while all empirical phenomena must result from determining causes, human thought introduces something seemingly not found elsewhere in nature—the ability to conceive of the world in terms of how it \"ought\" to be, or how it might otherwise be. For Kant, subjective reasoning is necessarily distinct from how the world is empirically. Because of its capacity to distinguish \"is\" from \"ought\", reasoning can 'spontaneously' originate new events without being itself determined by what already exists. It is on this basis that Kant argues against a version of compatibilism in which, for instance, the actions of the criminal are comprehended as a blend of determining forces and free choice, which Kant regards as misusing the word \"free\". Kant proposes that taking the compatibilist view involves denying the distinctly subjective capacity to re-think an intended course of action in terms of what \"ought\" to happen. Ted Honderich explains his view that the mistake of compatibilism is to assert that nothing changes as a consequence of determinism, when clearly we have lost the life-hope of origination.\n\n"}
{"id": "5042360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5042360", "title": "Constructive set theory", "text": "Constructive set theory\n\nConstructive set theory is an approach to mathematical constructivism following the program of axiomatic set theory. That is, it uses the usual first-order language of classical set theory, and although of course the logic is constructive, there is no explicit use of constructive types. Rather, there are just sets, thus it can look very much like classical mathematics done on the most common foundations, namely the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms (ZFC).\n\nIn 1973, John Myhill proposed a system of set theory based on intuitionistic logic taking the most common foundation, ZFC, and throwing away the axiom of choice (AC) and the law of the excluded middle (LEM), leaving everything else as is. However, different forms of some of the ZFC axioms which are equivalent in the classical setting are inequivalent in the constructive setting, and some forms imply LEM.\n\nThe system, which has come to be known as IZF, or Intuitionistic Zermelo–Fraenkel (ZF refers to ZFC without the axiom of choice), has the usual axioms of extensionality, pairing, union, infinity, separation and power set. The axiom of regularity is stated in the form of an axiom schema of set induction. Also, while Myhill used the axiom schema of replacement in his system, IZF usually stands for the version with collection.\n\nWhile the axiom of replacement requires the relation \"φ\" to be a function over the set \"A\" (that is, for every \"x\" in \"A\" there is associated exactly one \"y\"), the axiom of collection does not: it merely requires there be associated at least one \"y\", and it asserts the existence of a set which collects at least one such \"y\" for each such \"x\". The axiom of regularity as it is normally stated implies LEM, whereas the form of set induction does not. The formal statements of these two schemata are:\n\nformula_1\n\nformula_2\n\nAdding LEM back to IZF results in ZF, as LEM makes collection equivalent to replacement and set induction equivalent to regularity. Even without LEM, IZF's proof-theoretical power equals that of ZF.\n\nWhile IZF is based on intuitionistic rather than classical logic, it is considered impredicative. It allows formation of sets using the axiom of separation with any proposition, including ones which contain quantifiers which are not bounded. Thus new sets can be formed in terms of the universe of all sets. Additionally the power set axiom implies the existence of a set of truth values. In the presence of LEM, this set exists and has two elements. In the absence of it, the set of truth values is also considered impredicative.\n\nThe subject was begun by John Myhill to provide a formal foundation for Errett Bishop's program of constructive mathematics. As he presented it, Myhill's system CST is a constructive first-order logic with three sorts: natural numbers, functions, and sets. The system is:\n\n\nPeter Aczel's \"constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel\", or CZF, is essentially IZF with its impredicative features removed. It strengthens the collection scheme, and then drops the impredicative power set axiom and replaces it with another collection scheme. Finally the separation axiom is restricted, as in Myhill's CST. This theory has a relatively simple interpretation in a version of constructive type theory and has modest proof theoretic strength as well as a fairly direct constructive and predicative justification, while retaining the language of set theory. Adding LEM to this theory also recovers full ZF.\n\nThe collection axioms are:\n\nStrong collection schema: This is the constructive replacement for the axiom schema of replacement. It states that if φ is a binary relation between sets which is \"total\" over a certain domain set (that is, it has at least one image of every element in the domain), then there exists a set which contains at least one image under φ of every element of the domain, and only images of elements of the domain. Formally, for any formula φ:\n\nformula_3\n\nSubset collection schema: This is the constructive version of the power set axiom. Formally, for any formula φ:\n\nformula_4\n\nThis is equivalent to a single and somewhat clearer axiom of fullness: between any two sets \"a\" and \"b\", there is a set \"c\" which contains a total subrelation of any total relation between \"a\" and \"b\" that can be encoded as a set of ordered pairs. Formally:\n\nformula_5\n\nwhere the references to \"P(a,b)\" are defined by:\n\nformula_6\n\nformula_7\n\nand some set-encoding of the ordered pair <x,y> is assumed.\n\nThe axiom of fullness implies CST's axiom of exponentiation: given two sets, the collection of all total functions from one to the other is also in fact a set.\n\nThe remaining axioms of CZF are: the axioms of extensionality, pairing, union, and infinity are the same as in ZF; and set induction and predicative separation are the same as above.\n\nIn 1977 Aczel showed that CZF can be interpreted in Martin-Löf type theory, (using the propositions-as-types approach) providing what is now seen a standard model of CZF in type theory. In 1989 Ingrid Lindström showed that non-well-founded sets obtained by replacing the axiom of foundation in CZF with Aczel's anti-foundation axiom (CZFA) can also be interpreted in Martin-Löf type theory.\n\nPresheaf models for constructive set theory were introduced by Nicola Gambino in 2004. They are analogous to the Presheaf models for intuitionistic set theory developed by Dana Scott in the 1980s (which remained unpublished).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47958972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47958972", "title": "Credibility thesis", "text": "Credibility thesis\n\nThe credibility thesis is a proposed heterodox theoretical framework for understanding how societal institutions or social rules come about and evolve. It posits that institutions emerge from intentional institution-building but never in the originally intended form. Instead, institutional development is endogenous and spontaneously ordered and institutional persistence can be explained by their credibility, which is provided by the function that particular institutions serve rather than their theoretical or ideological form. The credibility thesis can be applied to explain, for example, why purported institutional improvements do not take hold as part of structural adjustment programs, while other economies in the developing world deliver growth despite absence of clear and strong market mechanisms such as indisputable private property rights or clearly delineated and registered land tenure.\n\nAccording to the credibility thesis, institutional persistence, meaning the survival and change of particular institutions through time is determined by the function of the institution and actors' expectations of the institution to play that function. The Credibility Thesis has put forward “that what ultimately determines the performance of institutions is not their form in terms of formality, privatization, or security, but their spatially and temporally defined function. In different wording, institutional function presides over form; the former can be expressed by its credibility, that is, the perceived social support at a given time and space.” In this sense, the thesis predicts that institutions that persist over time likely are credible, thus functional. If not, they would have changed or gone extinct. This principle holds for whatever form an institution may assume, regardless whether it is formal or informal, public or private, secure or insecure.\n\nA typical example is sharecropping, which has been regarded as economically inefficient or \"second-best\". However, its persistence throughout time has challenged this premise, leading others to conclude that it is efficient, thus credible and functional. That credibility has been confirmed in other studies.\n\nChanges in institutional arrangements, such as changes from informal land tenure and informal housing to a formalized real estate market or gradually declining prevalence of formal marriage or customary rights, are brought about by rule-making in a multi-actor playing field, where even the strongest actors cannot fully dictate institutional arrangements.In effect, when powerful actors exogenously impose institutions that contradict the evolutionary flow of endogenously emerged functions, the newly designed arrangements will invariably develop into \"empty institutions\" and \"non credible\" institutions.\n\nAn institution that appears stable and unchanging over time is often alleged to exist in an equilibrium wherein actors' conflicting interests on what form the institution should take are locked in a frozen conflict. For example, whether land holdings should be registered in a cadastre or if informal exchange of payment for use rights can suffice as confirmation of a land sale, constitute two possible institutional arrangements and either can be beneficial to different actors' interests. That no actor perceives an immediate opportunity to change the arrangement to their advantage is a sign of the credibility of the assignment and the source of the equilibrium of institutional arrangement. However, in actuality disequilibrium characterises institutional arrangements and equilibrium is transitory and rare. What is perceived as persistence of institutions is, in fact, the occurrence of infinitesimally small institutional changes over time under a veneer of apparent stability. In this context, the credibility thesis is predicated upon the notion of dynamic disequilibrium. It is also why in this respect the credibility theory is juxtaposed to structural functionalism, which is based on presupposed societal equilibrium.\n\nA series of underlying postulates for the credibility thesis have been proposed:\n\n\n\"Given that all involved actors are constantly interested in changing institutional design, credibility cannot be measured by directly asking respondents whether they find an institution credible.\n\nInstead it has to be operationalized through proxies, such as the level of conflict that an institution generates, the extent of 'institutional robustness' expressed as a function of institutional lifespan and flexibility, the degree to which an institution facilitates or frustrates overall socio-economic, political and cultural change, and the extent to which an institution fulfils the functions it ought to perform in the eyes of social actors.\" \n\nSuch \"opening of the black box\" of institutions is possible using mixed methods to describe institutions in detail over time and space, which serves as an \"archaeology of institutions\". The archaeology of institutions can be understood as \"an approach by which the change of institutions is meticulously recorded, interpreted and studied through the collection of data from every possible source, regardless of whether that is socio-economic, historical, ethno-anthropological, geographical, psychological or legal-political.\" An example of this, is the history of China's titling and housing ownership.\n\nWhile predominantly applied to land-related institutions, this approach could be applied to analysis of other means of production, such as capital (e.g. banks and industries), labor (trade unions) or beyond (water management and notaries).\n\nThe proxies that can be used to measure credibility include the following:\n\n\nWhen credibility is assessed through these proxies, a better sense can be obtained of the current function that institutions fulfil for a group of actors. In result, one is likely better positioned to predict institutional interventions that might rally social support. Depending on the level of credibility, these can be envisioned as positioned on a gradient from condoning or non-intervention to co-opting, facilitating, prohibiting and ordaining.\n\nThe CSI Checklist (Credibility Scales and Intervention) was developed for this purpose.\n\nApart from studying credibility in real-life situations, the particular premises of the theory – endogeneity, dis-equilibrium, and functional adaptation – make it also suitable for simulation in agent-based models.\n\nThe question of credibility first emerged along with concern about certain institutional interventions failing. In the mid-20th century Vilhelm Aubert noted that the Housemaid Law in Norway had been implemented but flaunted by all involved actors. The concept of credibility was initially coined as an \"explanandum\" for the success and failure of Western monetary, anti-inflationary policies in the 1970s. A concern for the credibility of policy emerged in the latter half of the 20th century in response to frequently observed failures of neoliberal structural adjustments in the developing world associated with the Washington Consensus. Institutional reform, such as privatization, failed to deliver the predicted economic growth, not because of lacking credible commitment on part of actors but due to the absence of endogenous credibility.\n\nIn contrast, the growth of the Chinese economy despite lack of many institutions considered to be essential for economic growth indicated that institutional arrangements do not necessarily determine economic outcomes, and also at the same time economic development does not automatically lead to teleologically predetermined institutional forms. This has been particularly striking in the case of real estate sector in China. In this context, there is a growing body of research suggesting one should focus on the function or quality of institutional performance rather than their form. As noted by Ha-Joon Chang: “a big problem that dogs the current orthodox literature on development is its inability to clearly distinguish between the forms and functions of institutions.” \n\nThe term \"credibility thesis\" was put forth by Peter Ho in 2014. In a review of the credibility thesis, Delilah Griswold contended that \"credibility is a powerful metric by which to understand and evaluate tenure systems. Importantly, understanding the credibility of a given institution requires analysis outside of theory and politics, analysis that is locally and temporally specific and multilayered.\"\n\n\nRelated theories and theoretical bodies\n\n"}

Their purpose is to iterate through a tree by working along multiple branches in parallel and merging the results of each branch into one common solution, in order to minimize time spent searching for a value in a tree-like data structure.\n\nThe original paper was written in 1988 by Chris Ferguson and Richard E. Korf, from the University of California's Computer Science Department. They used multiple other chess AIs to develop this wider range algorithm.\n\nThe Distributed Tree Search Algorithm (also known as Korf-Ferguson algorithm) was created to solve the following problem : « Given a tree with non-uniform branching factor and depth, search it in parallel with an arbitrary number of processors as fast as possible. »\n\nThe top-level part of this algorithm is general and does not use a particular existing type of tree-search, but it can be easily specialized to fit any type of non-distributed tree-search.\n\nDTS consists of using multiple processes, each with a node and a set of processors attached, with the goal of searching the sub-tree below the said node. Each process then divides itself into multiple coordinated sub-processes which recursively divide themselves again until an optimal way to search the tree has been found based on the number of processors available to each process. Once a process finishes, DTS dynamically reassigns the processors to other processes as to keep the efficiency to a maximum through good load-balancing, especially in irregular trees.\n\nOnce a process finishes searching, it recursively sends and merges a resulting signal to its parent-process, until all the different sub-answers have been merged and the entire problem has been solved.\n\nDTS is only applicable under two major conditions: the data structure to search through is a tree, and the algorithm can make use of at least one computation unit (Although it cannot be considered as distributed if there is only one).\n\nOne major example of the everyday use of DTS is network routing. The Internet can be seen as a tree of IP addresses, and an analogy to a routing protocol could be how post offices work in the real world. Since there are over 4.3 billion IP addresses currently, society heavily depends on the time the data takes to find its way to its destination. As such, IP-routing divides the work into multiple sub-units which each have different scales of calculation capabilities and use each other's result to find the route in a very efficient manner. This is an instance of DTS that affects over 43% of the world's population, for reasons going from entertainment to national security.\n\nAlthough DTS is currently one of the most widely used algorithms, many of its applications have alternatives to them which could potentially develop into more efficient, less resource-demanding solutions, were they more researched.\n\nOne of the more controversial examples is Big-Data processing. In applications like Google Search Engine, Facebook, YouTube, search needs to be optimized to keep waiting time inside a reasonable window. This could be achieved through the plain use of DTS, but other algorithms are used in place (for example data-hashing in SQL databases), or in conjunction (Facebook's Haystack algorithm groups parallel tree-search, data-hashing and memory-ordering/sorting).\n\nOne of the more important limits of DTS is the fact that it requires a tree as input. Trees are a sub-instance of a data structure known as Graphs, which means every Graph can be converted into a tree. Although there currently exists no better way to search through trees than Korf-Ferguson's algorithm, each task has different particularities and in most cases, there will exist more efficient data structures to represent the problem and solve it than through tree-search. And so there exist instances of tree structures with cycles that cannot possibly be faster than a graph-search on the same structure with the same processing power.\n\nThere are few controversies around Korf-Ferguson's DTS algorithm, since it is recognized as very complete, but simple. It is very often used as a stepping stone for students to discover the fundamentals and key concepts of distributed problem-solving.\n\nThe most important challenge to this algorithmic concept was an article by Kröll B, « Balanced Distributed Sarch Trees Do Not Exist », which does not attack the veracity or current efficiency of the algorithm, but rather the fact that DTS itself, no matter how many improvements are made to it (for example balancing the input tree before-hand), will never be able to reach optimal resolution-time. This opens a new view point : are too many resources used into the completion of DTS, which blocks new algorithms with higher efficiency-potential from getting researched and developed ? Another limit of DTS is the fact that no matter how efficient the division, coordination and merging of the solutions is, it will always be limited by the material number or processors and their processing power. Until recently, this was admitted as being a limit to nearly every computation, but new-generation algorithms like Euclideon might one day be able to crush DFS's efficiency through processing-power-independent problem resolution.\n\nTree (data structure)\n\nSearch tree\n\nBinary search tree\n\nTree traversal\n\nMonte Carlo tree search\n\nParallel computing\n"}

{"id": "51512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51512", "title": "Etiquette", "text": "Etiquette\n\nEtiquette ( or , ) is a code of behavior that delineates expectations for social behavior according to contemporary conventional norms within a society, social class, or group.\n\nThe French word \"étiquette\", literally signifying a tag or label, was used in a modern sense in English around 1750. Etiquette is behaviour that assists survival and has changed and evolved over the years.\n\nIn the 3rd millennium BC, Ptahhotep wrote \"The Maxims of Ptahhotep\". The Maxims were conformist precepts extolling such civil virtues as truthfulness, self-control and kindness towards one's fellow beings. Learning by listening to everybody and knowing that human knowledge is never perfect are a leitmotif. Avoiding open conflict wherever possible should not be considered weakness. Stress is placed on the pursuit of justice, although it is conceded that it is a god's command that prevails in the end. Some of the maxims refer to one's behaviour when in the presence of the great, how to choose the right master and how to serve him. Others teach the correct way to lead through openness and kindness. Greed is the base of all evil and should be guarded against, while generosity towards family and friends is deemed praiseworthy.\n\nConfucius (551–479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher whose philosophy emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity.\n\nBaldassare Castiglione (Italian: [baldasˈsaːre kastiʎˈʎoːne]; December 6, 1478 – February 2, 1529), count of Casatico, was an Italian courtier, diplomat, soldier and a prominent Renaissance author, who is probably most famous for his authorship of The Book of the Courtier. The work was an example of a courtesy book, dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier, and was very influential in 16th century European court circles.\n\nLouis XIV (1638–1718) \"transformed a royal hunting lodge in Versailles, a village 25 miles southwest of the capital, into one of the largest palaces in the world, officially moving his court and government there in 1682. It was against this awe-inspiring backdrop that Louis tamed the nobility and impressed foreign dignitaries, using entertainment, ceremony and a highly codified system of etiquette to assert his supremacy.”\n\nDuring the Enlightenment era, a self-conscious process of the imposition of polite norms and behaviours became a symbol of being a genteel member of the upper class. Upwardly mobile middle class bourgeoisie increasingly tried to identify themselves with the elite through their adopted artistic preferences and their standards of behaviour. They became preoccupied with precise rules of etiquette, such as when to show emotion, the art of elegant dress and graceful conversation and how to act courteously, especially with women. Influential in this new discourse was a series of essays on the nature of politeness in a commercial society, penned by the philosopher Lord Shaftesbury in the early 18th century. Shaftesbury defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company:\n\nPeriodicals, such as \"The Spectator\", founded as a daily publication by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele in 1711, gave regular advice to its readers on how to conform to the etiquette required of a polite gentleman. Its stated goal was \"to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality... to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses\" It provided its readers with educated, topical talking points, and advice in how to carry on conversations and social interactions in a polite manner.\n\nThe allied notion of 'civility' – referring to a desired social interaction which valued sober and reasoned debate on matters of interest – also became an important quality for the 'polite classes'. Established rules and procedures for proper behaviour as well as etiquette conventions, were outlined by gentlemen's clubs, such as Harrington's Rota Club. Periodicals, including \"The Tatler\" and \"The Spectator\", infused politeness into English coffeehouse conversation, as their explicit purpose lay in the reformation of English manners and morals. Etiquette is the virtue of morality and code of behaviour.\nIt was Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield who first used the word 'etiquette' in its modern meaning, in his \"Letters to His Son on the Art of Becoming a Man of the World and a Gentleman\". This work comprised over 400 letters written from 1737 or 1738 and continuing until his son's death in 1768, and were mostly instructive letters on various subjects. The letters were first published by his son's widow Eugenia Stanhope in 1774. Chesterfield endeavoured to decouple the issue of manners from conventional morality, arguing that mastery of etiquette was an important weapon for social advancement. The Letters were full of elegant wisdom and perceptive observation and deduction. Chesterfield epitomised the restraint of polite 18th-century society, writing, for instance, in 1748:\nBy the Victorian era, etiquette had developed into an exceptionally complicated system of rules, governing everything from the proper method for writing letters and using cutlery to the minutely regulated interactions between different classes and gender.\n\nManners are described as good or bad to indicate whether or not a behavior is socially acceptable. Every culture adheres to a different set of manners, although a lot of manners are cross-culturally common. Manners are a subset of social norms which are informally enforced through self-regulation and social policing and publicly performed. They enable human ‘ultrasociality’ by imposing self-restraint and compromise on regular, everyday actions.\n\nIn his book The Civilizing Process, Norbert Elias argued that manners arose as a product of group living and persist as a way of maintaining social order. He theorized that manners proliferated during the Renaissance in response to the development of the ‘absolute state’ – the progression from small group living to the centralization of power by the state. Elias believed that the rituals associated with manners in the Court Society of England during this period were closely bound with social status. To him, manners demonstrate an individual’s position within a social network and act as a means by which the individual can negotiate that position.\n\nPetersen and Lupton argue that manners helped reduce the boundaries between the public sphere and the private sphere and gave rise to \"“a highly reflective self, a self who monitors his or her behavior with due regard for others with whom he or she interacts socially.”\" They explain that; \"“The public behavior of \"individuals came to signify their social standing, a means of presenting the self and of evaluating others and thus the control of the outward self was\"\n\"vital.”\" From this perspective, manners are seen not just as a means of displaying one’s social status, but also as a\nmeans of maintaining social\nboundaries relative to class and identity.\n\nPierre Bourdieu’s notion of \"‘habitus’\" can also contribute to the understanding of manners. The habitus, he explains, is a set of \"‘dispositions’\" that are\nneither self-determined, nor pre-determined, by external environmental factors. They tend to operate at a subconscious level and are \"“inculcated through experience and explicit teaching”\" and produced and reproduced by social interactions. Manners, in this view, are likely to be a central part of the \"‘dispositions’\" which guide an individual’s ability to make socially compliant behavioral decisions.\n\nAnthropologists concern themselves primarily with detailing cultural variances and differences in \"‘ways of seeing’.\" Theorists such as Mary Douglas have\nclaimed that each culture’s unique set of manners, behaviors and rituals enable the local cosmology to remain ordered and free from those things that may pollute or\ndefile it. In particular, she suggests that ideas of pollution and disgust are attached to the margins of socially acceptable behavior to curtail such actions and\nmaintain\"“ the assumptions by which experience is controlled.”\"\n\nEvolutionary biology looks at the origin of behavior and the motivation behind it. Charles Darwin analyzed the remarkable universality of facial responses to disgust, shame and other complex emotions. Having identified the same behavior in young infants and blind individuals he concluded that these responses are not learned but innate. According to Val Curtis, the development of these responses was concomitant with the development of manners behavior. For Curtis, manners play an evolutionary role in the prevention of disease. This assumes that those who were hygienic, polite to others and most able to benefit from their membership within a cultural group, stand the best\nchance of survival and reproduction.\n\nCatherine Cottrell and Steven Neuberg explore how our behavioral responses to ‘otherness’ may enable the preservation of manners and norms. They suggest that the foreignness or unfamiliarity we experience when interacting with different cultural groups for the first time, may partly serve an evolutionary function: \"“Group living surrounds one with individuals able to physically harm fellow group members, to spread contagious disease, or to “free ride” on their efforts. A commitment to sociality thus carries a risk: If threats such as these are left unchecked, the costs of sociality will quickly exceed its benefits. Thus, to maximize the returns on group \"living, individual group members should be attuned to others’ features or behaviors.”\"\n\nThus, people who possess similar traits, common to the group, are to be trusted, whereas those who do not are to be considered as ‘others’ and treated with suspicion or even exclusion. Curtis argues that selective pressure borne out of a shift towards communal living would have resulted in individuals being shunned from the group for hygiene lapses or uncooperative behavior. This would have led to people avoiding actions that might result in embarrassment or others being disgusted. Joseph Henrich and Robert Boyd developed a\nmodel to demonstrate this process at work. They explain natural selection has favored the acquisition of genetically transmitted learning mechanisms that increase an individual’s chance of acquiring locally adaptive behavior. They hypothesize that: \"“Humans possess a reliably developing neural encoding that compels them both to punish individuals who violate group norms (common beliefs or practices) and punish individuals who do not punish norm violators.”\" From this approach, manners are a means of mitigating undesirable behavior and fostering the benefits of in-group cooperation.\n\nCurtis also specifically outlines three manner categories; hygiene, courtesy and cultural norms, each of which help to account for the multifaceted role manners play in society.\nThese categories are based on the outcome rather than the motivation of manners behavior and individual manner behaviors may fit into 2 or more categories.\n\nHygiene Manners – are any manners which affect disease transmission. They are likely to be taught at an early age, primarily through parental discipline, positive behavioral\nenforcement of continence with bodily fluids (such as toilet training), and the avoidance or removal of items that pose a disease risk for children. It is expected that,\nby adulthood, hygiene manners are so entrenched in one’s behavior that they become second nature. Violations are likely to elicit disgust responses.\n\nCourtesy Manners – demonstrate one’s ability to put the interests of others before oneself; to display self-control and good intent for the purposes of being trusted\nin social interactions. Courtesy manners help to maximize the benefits of group living by regulating social interaction. Disease avoidance behavior can sometimes be compromised in the performance of courtesy manners. They may be taught in the same way as hygiene manners but are likely to also be learned through direct,\nindirect (i.e. observing the interactions of others) or imagined (i.e. through the executive functions of the brain) social interactions. The learning of courtesy manners may take place\nat an older age than hygiene manners, because individuals must have at least some means of communication and some awareness of self and social positioning.\nThe violation of courtesy manners most commonly results in social disapproval from peers.\n\nCultural Norm Manners – typically demonstrate one’s identity within a specific socio-cultural group. Adherence to cultural norm manners allows for the demarcation of socio-cultural identities and the creation of boundaries which inform who is to be trusted or who is to be deemed as ‘other’. Cultural norm manners are learnt through the enculturation and routinisation of ‘the familiar’ and through exposure to ‘otherness’ or those who are identified as foreign or different. Transgressions and non-adherence to cultural norm manners commonly result in alienation. Cultural norms, by their very nature, have a high level of between-group variability but are likely to be common to all those who identify with a given group identity.\n\nRules of etiquette encompass most aspects of social interaction in any society, though the term itself is not commonly used. A rule of etiquette may reflect an underlying ethical code, or it may reflect a person's fashion or status. Rules of etiquette are usually unwritten, but aspects of etiquette have been codified from time to time.\n\nBaldassare Castiglione was an Italian courtier, diplomat, soldier and a prominent Renaissance author, who is probably most famous for his authorship of The Book of the Courtier. The work was an example of a courtesy book, dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier, and was very influential in 16th century European court circles.\n\nErasmus of Rotterdam published his book \"On Good Manners for Boys\" in 1530. Amid his advice for young children on fidgeting, yawning, bickering and scratching he highlights that a core tenet of manners is the ability to “\"readily ignore the faults of others but avoid falling short yourself\"”.\n\nIn centuries since then, many authors have tried to collate manners or etiquette guide books. One of the most famous of these was Emily Post who began to document etiquette in 1922. She described her work as detailing the “\"trivialities\"” of desirable everyday conduct but also provided descriptions of appropriate conduct for key life events such as baptisms, weddings and funerals. She later established an institute which continues to provide updated advice on how to negotiate modern day society with good manners and decorum. The most recent edition of her book provides advice on such topics as when it is acceptable to ‘unfriend’ someone on Facebook and who is entitled to which armrest when flying. Etiquette books such as these as well as those by Amy Vanderbilt, Hartley, Judith Martin, and Sandi Toksvig outline suggested behaviours for a range of social interactions. However, all note that to be a well-mannered person one must not merely read their books but be able to employ good manners fluidly in any situation that may arise. How Rude! is an American series of comic manners books for teens.\n\nThe etiquette of business is the set of written and unwritten rules of conduct that make social interactions run more smoothly. Office etiquette in particular applies to coworker interaction, excluding interactions with external contacts such as customers and suppliers. When conducting group meetings in the United States, the assembly might follow \"Robert's Rules of Order\", if there are no other company policies to control a meeting.\n\nThese rules are often echoed throughout an industry or economy. For instance, 49% of employers surveyed in 2005 by the American National Association of Colleges and Employers found that non-traditional attire would be a \"strong influence\" on their opinion of a potential job candidate. Business Etiquette at companies such as IBM influence global business etiquette and professional standards.\n\nBoth office and business etiquette overlap considerably with basic tenets of netiquette, the social conventions for using computer networks.\n\nBusiness etiquette can vary significantly in different countries, which is invariably related to their culture. For example: A notable difference between Chinese and Western business etiquette is conflict handling. Chinese businesses prefer to look upon relationship management to avoid conflicts – stemming from a culture that heavily relies on \"guanxi\" (personal connections) – while the west leaves resolution of conflict to the interpretations of law through contracts and lawyers.\n\nAdjusting to foreign etiquettes is a major complement of culture shock, providing a market for manuals. Other resources include business and diplomacy institutions, available only in certain countries such as the UK.\n\nIn 2011, a group of etiquette experts and international business group formed a non-profit organization called IITTI (pronounced as \"ET\") to help human resource (HR) departments of multinationals in measuring the etiquette skills of prospective new employees during the recruitment process by standardizing image and etiquette examination, similar to what ISO does for industrial process measurements.\n\nEtiquette in retail is sometimes summarized as \"The customer is always right.\" \n\nEtiquette is dependent on culture; what is excellent etiquette in one society may shock another. Etiquette evolves within culture. The Dutch painter Andries Both shows that the hunt for head lice (\"illustration, right\"), which had been a civilized grooming occupation in the early Middle Ages, a bonding experience that reinforced the comparative rank of two people, one groomed the other, one was the subject of the groomer, had become a peasant occupation by 1630. The painter portrays the familiar operation matter-of-factly, without the disdain this subject would have received in a 19th-century representation.\n\nEtiquette can vary widely between different cultures and nations. For example, in Hausa culture, eating while standing may be seen as offensively casual and ill-omened behavior, insulting the host and showing a lack of respect for the scarcity of food—the offense is known as \"eating with the devil\" or \"committing \"santi\".\" In China, a person who takes the last item of food from a common plate or bowl without first offering it to others at the table may be seen as a glutton who is insulting the host's generosity. Traditionally, if guests do not have leftover food in front of them at the end of a meal, it is to the dishonour of the host. In the United States of America, a guest is expected to eat all of the food given to them, as a compliment to the quality of the cooking. However, it is still considered polite to offer food from a common plate or bowl to others at the table.\n\nIn such rigid hierarchal cultures as Korea and Japan, alcohol helps to break down the strict social barrier between classes. It allows for a hint of informality to creep in. It is traditional for host and guest to take turns filling each other's cups and encouraging each other to gulp it down. For someone who does not consume alcohol (except for religious reasons), it can be difficult escaping the ritual of the social drink.\n\nEtiquette is a topic that has occupied writers and thinkers in all sophisticated societies for millennia, beginning with a behavior code by Ptahhotep, a vizier in ancient Egypt's Old Kingdom during the reign of the Fifth Dynasty king Djedkare Isesi (c. 2414–2375 BC). All known literate civilizations, including ancient Greece and Rome, developed rules for proper social conduct. Confucius included rules for eating and speaking along with his more philosophical sayings.\n\nEarly modern conceptions of what behavior identifies a \"gentleman\" were codified in the 16th century, in a book by Baldassare Castiglione, \"Il Cortegiano\" (\"The Courtier\"); its codification of expectations at the court of Urbino remained in force in its essentials until World War I. Louis XIV established an elaborate and rigid court ceremony, but distinguished himself from the high bourgeoisie by continuing to eat, stylishly and fastidiously, with his fingers. An important book about etiquette is \"Il Galateo\" by Giovanni della Casa; in fact, in Italian, etiquette is generally called \"galateo\" (or \"etichetta\" or \"protocollo\").\n\nIn the American colonies, Benjamin Franklin and George Washington wrote codes of conduct for young gentlemen. The immense popularity of advice columns and books by Letitia Baldrige and Miss Manners shows the currency of this topic. Even more recently, the rise of the Internet has necessitated the adaptation of existing rules of conduct to create Netiquette, which governs the drafting of e-mail, rules for participating in an online forum, and so on.\n\nIn Germany, many books dealing with etiquette, especially dining, dressing etc., are called \"the Knigge\", named after Adolph Freiherr Knigge who wrote the book \"Über den Umgang mit Menschen\" (\"On Human Relations\") in the late 18th century. However, this book is about good manners and also about the social state of its time, but not about etiquette.\n\nEtiquette may be wielded as a social weapon. The outward adoption of the superficial mannerisms of an in-group, in the interests of social advancement rather than a concern for others, is considered by many a form of snobbery, lacking in virtue.\n\nEtiquette and language\n\nEtiquette and society\n\nWorldwide etiquette\n\n\n"}

The Ferrer Modern School opened later. The project was named after Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia, an educator, activist and anarchist who founded the Modern School movement in Spain. The intentional community was run by consensus decision-making. Inhabitants were free to leave or join, with no questions asked. It gained a reputation for being a center of the free love movement, which drew in new inhabitants.\n\nThe colony purchased farmland for about $100 a plot. The plot was then sold to a community member for $150. By 1922, at their peak, 90 homes had been established. Some of the homes were only lived in during the weekend because people commuted to work in New York City.\n\nDuring the World War II the U.S. Government bought the surrounding land, and the buildings that were only occupied sporadically were subject to theft and vandalism. Parents then stopped sending their children to the school. Between 1955 and 1958, the assets of the school were sold off.

Abuse by proxy (or proxy abuse) is a closely related or synonymous concept.\n\nFlying monkeys are distinct from enablers.

{"id": "607960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=607960", "title": "Harm principle", "text": "Harm principle\n\nThe harm principle holds that the actions of individuals should only be limited to prevent harm to other individuals. John Stuart Mill articulated this principle in \"On Liberty\", where he argued that, \"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\" An equivalent was earlier stated in France's \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\" of 1789 as, \"Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law.\"\n\nThe belief \"that no one should be forcibly prevented from acting in any way he chooses provided his acts are not invasive of the free acts of others\" has become one of the basic principles of libertarian politics.\n\nWhile the phrase \"harm principle\" was not itself used until 1969, the harm principle itself was first fully articulated by the English thinker John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) in the first chapter of \"On Liberty\" (1859), where he argued that:\nEven if a self-regarding action results in harm to oneself, it is still beyond the sphere of justifiable state coercion.\n\nHarm itself is not a non-moral concept. The infliction of harm upon another person is what makes an action wrong.\n\nHarm can also result from a failure to meet an obligation. Morality generates obligations. Duty may be exacted from a person in the same way as a debt, and it is part of the notion of duty that a person may be rightfully compelled to fulfil it.\n\nMill's harm principle is distinct from the offense principle. The basis of comparison is that, in some cases, psychological or social harm may be comparable to physical harm. The difference is based on the assumption that offense may cause discomfort, but does not necessarily cause harm. Offense meets the harm principle only if it is a wrong and also causes harm.\n\nThe harm principle states that the only actions that can be prevented are ones that create harm. In other words, a person can do whatever he wants as long as his actions do not harm others. If a person's actions only affect himself, then society, which includes the government, should not be able to stop a person from doing what he wants. This even includes actions that a person may do that would harm the person himself.\n\nHowever, we cannot just stop there and think that Mill makes things seem so simple, because he doesn't. If we were to stop our discussion of the harm principle at 'anyone can do whatever they want just so long as it doesn't affect anyone else,' problems arise. One such problem may be what to do with people who want to end their own life. Mill said it would not be okay for this to happen.\n\nFor this to make the most sense, we need to understand three important ideas that helped shape the harm principle. The first is that the harm principle comes from another principle called the principle of utility. The principle of utility states that people should only do those things that bring the greatest amount of happiness to the greatest number of people. So, if a person is trying to decide between two things, he should choose the option that makes the most people happy.\n\nThe second idea is that Mill says there is a difference between harm and offense. Harm is something that would injure the rights of someone else or set back important interests that benefit others. An example of harm would be assaulting someone, causing them injury. An offense, according to Mill, is something that we would say 'hurt our feelings.' These are less serious and should not be prevented, because what may hurt one person's feelings may not hurt another's, and so offenses are not universal.\n\nThe third idea to understand is that it is very rare for an action to only affect the individual himself. Mill argues that no person is truly isolated from others and that most actions do affect other people in important ways.\n\nThe ethical question as to what extent there should be constraints on free speech is often grounded in both the harm principle and the offense principle. If the exercise of free speech can be causally linked to violence or similar physical harm, it is constrained under the harm principle. Free speech actions such as burning a flag or holding controversial rallies usually fall under the offense principle instead, based on the corresponding question of what constitutes harm (or, alternately, weighing harm caused by limiting a freedom vs harm caused by the exercise of that freedom).\n\nIn the abstract, criminalizing all wrongs that cause harm makes the offense principle almost synonymous with the harm principle. However, the definition of what constitutes a wrong may change over time—such that harm may be caused by actions that were not considered wrongs at the time, and vice versa.\n\nIn the same essay, Mill further explains the principle as a function of two maxims:\n\nThe second of these maxims has become known as the social authority principle.\n\nHowever, the second maxim also opens the question of broader definitions of harm, up to and including harm to the society. The concept of harm is not limited to harm to another individual but can be harm to individuals plurally, without specific definition of those individuals.\n\nThis is an important principle for the purpose of determining harm that only manifests gradually over time—such that the resulting harm can be anticipated, but does not yet exist at the time that the action causing harm was taken. It also applies to other issues—which range from the right of an entity to discharge broadly polluting waste on private property, to broad questions of licensing, and even to the right of sedition.\n\nThe United States Libertarian Party includes a version of the harm principle as part of its official party platform. It states:\n\n\n"}

In contrast, the members of heteronomous societies (hetero = others) attribute their imaginaries to some extra-social authority (e.g., God, the state, ancestors, historical necessity, etc.).\n\n"}

Without outside influences this situation will lead to a fear spiral (catch-22, vicious circle, Nash equilibrium) in which fear will lead to an arms race which in turn will lead to increasing fear. The Hobbesian trap can be explained in terms of game theory. Although cooperation would be the better outcome for both sides, mutual distrust leads to the adoption of strategies that have negative outcomes for individual players and all players combined. The theory has been used to explain outbreaks of conflicts and violence, spanning from individuals to states.\n\nThe theory is most commonly associated with Thomas Hobbes and Thomas Schelling.\n\nSteven Pinker is a proponent of the theory of the Hobbesian trap and has applied the theory to many conflicts and outbreaks of violence between people, groups, tribes, societies and states. Issues of gun control have been described as a Hobbesian trap. A common example is the dilemma that both the armed burglar and the armed homeowner face when they meet each other. Neither side may want to shoot, but both are afraid of the other party shooting first so they may be inclined to fire pre-emptively, although the favorable outcome for both parties would be that nobody be shot. A similar example between two states is the Cuban Missile Crisis. Fear and mutual distrust between the actors increased the likelihood of a preemptive strike.\n\nThe Hobbesian trap can be avoided by influences that increase the trust between the two parties. In the Cuban Missile Crisis, for example, Kennedy and Khrushchev realized that they were caught in a Hobbesian trap which helped them to make concessions that reduced distrust and fear.\n\n\n\n"}

The word \"matter\" is derived from the Latin word \"māteria\", meaning \"wood\", or “timber”, in the sense \"material\", as distinct from \"mind\" or \"form\". The image of wood came to Latin as a calque from the Greek philosophical usage of \"hyle\" (ὕλη).\n\nIn ancient Greek philosophy, \"arche\" (ἀρχή) is the beginning or the first principle of the world. Thales of Miletus claimed that the first principle of all things is water. His theory was supported by the observation of moisture throughout the world and coincided with his theory that the earth floated on water.\n\nThales's theory was refuted by his pupil and successor, Anaximander. Anaximander noted that water could not be the arche because it could not give rise to its opposite, fire. Anaximander claimed that none of the elements (earth, fire, air, water) could be arche for the same reason. Instead, he proposed the existence of the apeiron, an indefinite substance from which all things are born and to which all things will return.\n\nAnaximenes, Anaximander's pupil, advanced yet another theory. He returns to the elemental theory, but this time posits air, rather than water, as the arche. Anaximenes suggests that all is made from air through either rarefication or condensation (thinning or thickening). Rarefied, air becomes fire; condensed, it becomes first wind, then cloud, water, earth, and stone in order.\n\nPythagoras of Samos, a mathematician, mystic, and scientist, taught that number, rather than matter, constitutes the true nature of things. He seems to have influenced Socrates' ideal form.\n\nHeraclitus held that all is flux. In such a system there is no need for or possibility of matter.\nLeucippus held that there exist indivisible particles, atoms, underlying existence.\n\nEmpedocles held that there are four elements, from which things are derived, Earth, Water, Fire and Air. Some added a fifth element, the Aether, from which the heavens were derived. Socrates accepted (or at least did not reject) that list, as seen from Plato's Timaeus, which identified the five elements with the Platonic solids. Earth was associated with the cube, air with the octahedron, water with the icosahedron, fire with the tetrahedron, and the heavens with the dodecahedron.\n\nAristotle, rejecting the atomic theory, instead analyzed the four terrestrial elements with the sense of touch:\n\nHe developed Socrates' ideal form into a theory which aimed to explain existence through the composition of matter and form. He conceived of matter as a passive possibility that something might be actualized by an active principle, a substantial form, giving it real existence. The theory of matter and form came to be known as Hylomorphism.\n\nAristotle's ideas had little impact on the ancient world. The rise of Stoicism represented the return to earlier ideas. Their categories were an attempt to explain all existence without reference to anything incorporeal.\n\nPhilo held that matter is the basis of evil.\n\nPlotinus revived the ideas of Plato and Aristotle. \n\nMany Christians, such as Augustine of Hippo, accepted Plotinus as the greatest of the pagan philosophers. Parts of Plotinus' \"Six Enneads\" were translated into Arabic as the \"Theology of Aristotle\", leading to a blossoming of Aristotle's philosophy in the Islamic world. This Islamic version of Aristotle eventually reached the University of Paris and the attention of scholastic philosophy, and the work of Thomas Aquinas.\n\nFrom a philosophical viewpoint, the term \"matter\" still is used to distinguish the material aspects of the universe from those of the spirit. The rise of modern chemistry and physics marked a return to the atomic theories of Leucippus. Quantum physics and special relativity however, complicate the picture through the identification of matter and energy, particle and wave.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31768127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31768127", "title": "Mature minor doctrine", "text": "Mature minor doctrine\n\nThe mature minor doctrine is an American term for the statutory, regulatory, or common law policy accepting that an unemancipated minor patient may possess the maturity to choose or reject a particular health care treatment, sometimes without the knowledge or agreement of parents, and should be permitted to do so. It is now generally considered a form of patients rights; formerly, the mature minor rule was largely seen as protecting health care providers from criminal and civil claims by parents of minors at least 15.\n\nJurisdictions may codify an age of medical consent, accept the judgment of licensed providers regarding an individual minor, or accept a formal court decision following a request that a patient be designated a mature minor, or may rely on some combination. For example, patients at least 16 may be assumed to be mature minors for this purpose, patients aged 13 to 15 may be designated so by licensed providers, and pre-teen patients may be so-designated after evaluation by an agency or court. The mature minor doctrine is sometimes connected with enforcing confidentiality of minor patients from their parents.\n\nIn the United States, a typical statute lists: \"Who may consent [or withhold consent for] surgical or medical treatment or procedures.\"\n\nBy definition, a \"mature minor\" has been found to have the capacity to make serious medical decisions alone. By contrast, \"medical emancipation\" formally releases children from some parental involvement requirements but does not necessarily grant that decision making to children themselves. Pursuant to statute, several jurisdictions grant medical emancipation to a minor who has become pregnant or requires sexual-health services, thereby permitting medical treatment without parental consent and, often, confidentiality from parents. A limited guardianship may be appointed to make medical decisions for the medically emancipated minor and the minor may not be permitted to refuse or even choose treatment.\n\nOne early U.S. case of significance, \"Smith v. Seibly\", 72 Wn.2d 16, 431 P.2d 719 (1967), before the Washington Supreme Court, establishes precedent on the mature minor doctrine. The plaintiff, Albert G. Smith, an 18-year-old married father, was suffering from myasthenia gravis, a progressive disease. Because of this, Smith expressed concern that his wife might become burdened in caring for him for their existing child and possibly for additional children. On March 9, 1961, while still 18, Smith requested a vasectomy. His doctor required written consent, which Smith provided, and the surgery was performed. Later, after reaching Washington's statutory age of majority, then 21, the doctor was sued by Smith, who now claimed that he had been a minor and thus unable to grant surgical or medical consent. The Court rejected Smith's argument: \"Thus, age, intelligence, maturity, training, experience, economic independence or lack thereof, general conduct as an adult and freedom from the control of parents are all factors to be considered in such a case [involving consent to surgery].\"\n\nThe court further quoted another recently decided case, \"Grannum v. Berard\", 70 Wn.2d 304, 307, 422 P.2d 812 (1967): \"The mental capacity necessary to consent to a surgical operation is a question of fact to be determined from the circumstances of each individual case.\" The court explicitly stated that a minor may grant surgical consent even without formal emancipation.\n\nEspecially since the 1970s, older pediatric patients sought to make autonomous decisions regarding their own treatment and sometimes sued successfully to do so. The decades of accumulated evidence tended to demonstrate that children are capable of participating in medical decision-making in a meaningful way; and legal and medical communities have demonstrated an increasing willingness of formally affirming decisions made by young people, even regarding life and death.\n\nReligious beliefs have repeatedly influenced a patient's decision to choose treatment or not. In a case in 1989 in Illinois, a 17 year old female Jehovah's Witness was permitted to refuse necessary life saving treatments.\n\nIn 1990, the United States Congress passed the Patient Self-Determination Act; even though key provisions apply only to patients over age 18, the legislation advanced patient involvement in decisionmaking. The West Virginia Supreme Court, in \"Belcher v. Charleston Area Medical Center\", 422 S.E.2d 827, 188 W.Va. 105 (1992), defined a \"mature minor\" exception to parental consent, according consideration to seven factors to be weighed regarding such a minor: age, ability, experience, education, exhibited judgment, conduct, and appreciation of relevant risks and consequences.\n\nIn the United States, bodily integrity has long been considered a common law right; the United States Supreme Court, in 1891's \"Union Pacific Railway Company v. Botsford\", found, \"No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law.\" The Supreme Court in 1990 (\"Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health\") allowed that \"constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred\" in the \"Due Process Clause\" of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but the Court refrained from explicitly establishing what would have been a newly enumerated right. Nevertheless, lower courts have increasingly held that competent patients have the right to refuse any treatment for themselves.\n\nIn 1989, the Supreme Court of Illinois interpreted the Supreme Court of the United States to have already adopted major aspects of mature minor doctrine, concluding,\n\nAn ongoing case of Z.M is being heard in Maryland regarding the minor's right to refuse chemotherapy.\n\nIn Connecticut, Cassandra C. a seventeen year old was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to receive treatment. The court decided that Cassandra was not mature enough to make medical decisions.\n\nIn 2009, the Supreme Court of Canada ruling in \"A.C. v. Manitoba\" [2009] SCC 30 (CanLII) found that children \"may\" make life and death decisions about their medical treatment. In the majority opinion, Justice Rosalie Abella wrote:\nA \"dissenting\" opinion by Justice Ian Binnie would have gone further:\nAnalysts note that the Canadian decision merely requires that younger patients be permitted a \"hearing\", and still allows a judge to \"decide whether or not to order a medical procedure on an unwilling minor\".\n"}

Frank challenged the idea that prosocial behavior was necessarily deleterious in business in his book \"What Price the Moral High Ground?\"\n\nHe argued that socially responsible firms often reap unexpected benefits even in highly competitive environments, because their commitment to principle makes them more attractive as partners to do business with.\n\nIn everyday use a person may take the perspective of the 'moral high ground' in order to produce a critique of something, or merely to win an argument. This perspective is sometimes associated to snobbery but may also be a legitimate way of taking up a stance.\n\nSocial sciences or philosophies are sometimes accused of taking the 'moral high ground' because they are often inherently interested in the project of human freedom and justice. The traditional project of education itself may be seen as defending a type of moral high ground from popular culture, perhaps by using critical pedagogy: its proponents may themselves be accused (rightly or wrongly) of seeking a false and unjustified sense of superiority thereby.\n\nKate Fillion considered that in the wake of second-wave feminism \"assumptions about female moral superiority pervade the public discourse\", placing women as \"comrades on the moral high ground, pitted against a common adversary who dwells in the shadowy depths far below\".\n\nRobert Lowell took the moral high ground, not once, but twice, with separate American presidents, in protesting US militarism.\n\nPeter Mandelson considered that Tony Blair was \"good at taking the high ground and throwing himself off it\".\n\n"}
{"id": "17685051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17685051", "title": "Multiple-alarm fire", "text": "Multiple-alarm fire\n\nOne-alarm, two-alarm, three-alarm fires, etc., are categories of fires indicating the level of response by local authorities. The term multiple-alarm is a quick way of indicating that a fire is severe and is difficult to contain. This system of classification is common in the United States and in Canada among both fire departments and news agencies.\n\nA common misconception is that a \"3-alarm fire,\" for example, means that three firehouses responded to the fire. This is not the rule behind the naming convention, although some cities may use the number of firehouses responding for multi-alarm designations because that is the simplest way to determine an alarm number.\n\nThe most widely used formula for multi-alarm designation is based on the number of units (firetrucks for example) and firefighters responding to a fire; the more vehicles and firefighters responding, the higher the alarm designation. (Note: In most cities, a \"unit\" can be anything from a tanker or ladder truck to rescue vehicles to even cars driven by the chief and deputies.)\n\nWith this unit/firefighter alarm designation, the initial dispatch is referred to as a \"first alarm\" and is typically the largest. Subsequent alarms are calls for additional units, usually because the fire has grown and additional resources are needed to combat it, or that the incident is persisting long enough that firefighters on scene need to be relieved.\n\nRequests for units and firefighters from outside jurisdictions do not normally occur in multi-firehouse urban areas until elevated alarms are reached (alarm three and above), but will depend on the location of the incident and the condition of the authority having jurisdiction at the time of the incident.\n\nThe system of classification comes from the old tradition of using pull stations to alert the local departments to a fire in their area. The \"box\" would send a message to all local stations by telegraph that there was a fire, indicating the location as a number: (station area)-(box number), e.g., 2-11. Fires are still dispatched as \"box alarms,\" following this tradition, with maps broken up into a grid of \"box areas.\"\n\nBelow is a list of the alarm levels used in the response policy of the New York City Fire Department. This is a basic example of how alarm levels are categorized in a fire department, how many fire apparatus or fire units respond to each alarm level, etc. In New York, however, additional special alarm levels are utilized, aside from the conventional 1st alarm, 2nd alarm, 3rd alarm, etc. Examples of such alarm levels are the signal 10-75 assignment, the signals 10-76 and 10-77 assignments, and the signal 10-60 assignment. A 10-75 is a working fire (i.e., there is fire visible from a building), the 10-76/10-77 assignments are the alarm levels separate from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd alarms, etc. that are the standard fire department responses to fires in high-rise buildings. The signal 10-60 is a separate response to major disasters. \n\nBelow is how alarm levels are categorized in order per protocol. Each apparatus count is in an addition per alarm (a five alarm assignment has 21 engine companies total). Each total is the total number of units on scene. \n\n1st alarm assignment / Box alarm assignment:\n\n1st alarm assignment / All hands box alarm assignment:\n\n2nd alarm assignment:\n\n3rd alarm assignment:\n\n4th alarm assignment:\n\n5th alarm assignment: \n\nIf the incident commander decides that the incident does not require a higher alarm level to be requested, they can specially request an additional unit to the scene without requesting a full alarm level assignment. For example, at a working fire, there are four engine companies, three ladder companies, one squad company, one rescue company, two battalion chiefs, and one division chief operating at the scene. If the fire is not large enough to require a 2nd alarm, but there is a need for more equipment and manpower, the commanding chief can request additional units to respond \"specially called\" to the scene.\n\nThus, at the scene of a 5th alarm fire in New York, there are a total of 20 engine companies, 11 ladder companies, one squad company, one rescue company, six battalion chiefs, one division chief, one deputy chief, one assistant chief, and the chief of operations, as well as multiple specialized units and or specially called units operating on the scene.\n\nAll of these companies come from many firehouses to the scene. Some companies, however, are quartered together at the same firehouses. So, it is not a matter of how many firehouses respond to a fire, as popularly believed, but rather, how many companies/units and how many firefighters are operating on scene.\n\n"}

In some cases, the term may apply to treatment of dead bodies, such as soldiers mutilated after they have been killed by an enemy.\n\nThe traditional Chinese practices of \"língchí\" and foot binding are forms of mutilation. One form of mutilation that has captured the imagination of Westerners is the \"long-neck\" people, a sub-group of the Karen known as the Padaung where women wear brass rings around their neck. The act of tattooing is also considered a form of self-mutilation according to some cultural traditions, such as within Christianity. A joint statement released by the United Nations and numerous other international bodies opposes female circumcision as a form of mutilation. Whether or not male circumcision amounts to mutilation is a subject of academic debate. The Danish Society for General Medicine has declared non medical male circumcision an ethically unacceptable mutilation while the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has condemned non medical male circumcision as a \"violation of the physical integrity of children\".\n\nCastration is also a form of mutilation, as are body piercing, some forms of extreme body modification, and some cosmetic surgery.\n\n\"Maiming\", or mutilation which involves the loss of, or incapacity to use, a bodily member, is and has been practised by many societies with various cultural and religious significances, and is also a customary form of physical punishment, especially applied on the principle of an eye for an eye.\n\nThe Araucanian warrior Galvarino suffered this punishment as a prisoner during the Spanish conquest of Chile.\n\nIn law, maiming is a criminal offence; the old law term for a special case of maiming of persons was mayhem, an Anglo-French variant form of the word.\n\nMaiming of animals by others than their owners is a particular form of the offence generally grouped as malicious damage. For the purpose of the law as to this offence animals are divided into cattle, which includes horses, pigs and asses, and other animals which are either subjects of larceny at common law or are usually kept in confinement or for domestic purposes.\n\nIn Britain under the Malicious Damage Act 1861 the punishment for maiming of cattle was three to fourteen years penal servitude; malicious injury to other animals is a misdemeanour punishable on summary conviction. For a second offence the penalty is imprisonment with hard labor for over twelve months. Maiming of animals by their owner falls under the Cruelty to Animals Acts.\n\nIn times when even judicial physical punishment was still commonly allowed to cause not only intense pain and public humiliation during the administration but also to inflict permanent physical damage, or even deliberately intended to mark the criminal for life by docking or branding, one of the common anatomical target areas not normally under permanent cover of clothing (so particularly merciless in the long term) were the ear(s).\n\nIn England, for example, various pamphleteers attacking the religious views of the Anglican episcopacy under William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, had their ears cut off for those writings: in 1630 Dr. Alexander Leighton and in 1637 still other Puritans, John Bastwick, Henry Burton and William Prynne.\n\nIn Scotland one of the Covenanters, James Gavin of Douglas, Lanarkshire, had his ears cut off for refusing to renounce his religious faith. In Japan, Gonsalo Garcia and his companions were similarly punished.\n\nNotably in various jurisdictions of colonial British North America, even relatively minor crimes, such as hog stealing, were punishable by having one's ears nailed to the pillory and slit loose, or even cropped, a counterfeiter would be branded on top (for that crime, considered lèse-majesté, the older mirror punishment was boiling in oil), which was an example of western mutilation.\n\nIndependence did not render American justice any less brutal. For example, in the future state of Tennessee, an example of harsh 'frontier law' under the 1780 Cumberland Compact took place in 1793 when Judge John McNairy sentenced Nashville's first horse thief, John McKain, Jr., to be fastened to a wooden stock one hour for 39 lashes, have his ears cut off and cheeks branded with the letters \"H\" and \"T\".\n\nTongue cutting is also a form of mutilation as this leads to bleeding to death in most cases with choking in the lungs.\n\nNebahne Yohannes, an unsuccessful claimant to the Ethiopian imperial throne who had his ears and nose cut off, yet was then freed. This form of mutilation against unsuccessful claimants to thrones has been in use in middle-eastern regions for thousands of years. To qualify as a king, formerly, one had to exemplify perfection. Obvious physical deformities such as missing noses, ears, or lips, are thereby sufficient disqualifications. The victim in these cases is typically freed alive to act (\"a\") as an example to others, and (\"b\") as no longer a threat.\n\n"}

She grew up in Alexandria and was part of the middle-class. Along with being an avid educator she wrote and published articles such as \"al-Ayat al –badyyina fi tarbiya al-banat\" (a treatise on girls' education) in 1902, \"al-Mar’a wa-l-‘amal\" (Woman and Work) in 1920 as well as editing a woman's page for \"al-Balagh al-usbui\" (The Weekly News).\n\nNabawiya Mohamed Musa Badawia, the inspiring Zagazigi fallahi woman that had strong nationalism and feminism ideas as a young-woman, she stood for the rights of her nation and fellow Egyptian women. Nabawiya's dad was an Egyptian officer who once went to a mission to Sudan and had never came back. Nabawiyya Musa was one of the first and last women to complete the education exam and be accepted into the Saniyya School under colonial rule because of their [who?] fear of women becoming too powerful ina society led by men. In her childhood her brother helped her learn to read and write at home; while she taught herself Math principles. By the time she turned thirteen she was keen on continuing her school education but her family refused, thus defying the established social norms of the time she stole her mother's stamp and sold her gold bracelet to apply for school and went on with her studies secretly against her family's wishes.\n\nShe finished her High School education in 1907 to become the first girl ever to finish high school in Egypt. In 1908 she finished her degree in education and went on to be a prominent educator for the middle-class and an advocate for women’s rights. It was not until after 1922 that more women were let into the newly established Egyptian University and by this time Nabawiyya Musa was a key lecturer and leader among her colleagues. Nabawiyya musa is famous because she was the first Egyption woman to go to high school.\n\nNabawiyya Musa was an avid writer and educator who gave lectures around Egypt advocating for the education of women. She believed strongly that educated women would only improve the state by being able to be independent, bring in money for the household as middle-class women and/or raise their children to be independent so they could grow up to be assets to society. She believed strongly that the lack of hierarchy in the peasant and lower classes was actually a good model of how women can be an asset to work and equal opportunities with men. She also believed that the differences between men and women were nothing but a social construct and could easily be broken with time. Through giving women and education she sought to end sexual violence against women. She believed that by giving women an equal status in the workforce and in education would make them less vulnerable and less prone to sexual violence.\n\nNabawiyya Musa was an integral part in the feminist movement in Egypt. She stood out because many of her views echoed very strong Egyptian Nationalism as well as equal opportunities for women. Along with highlighting the education of women, she was also a leading role model in breaking down the social constructs of women. She and her partners in the feminist movement believed that a radical call for unveiling of women was not needed in the beginning of the movement because Egypt was not ready to accept it.

{"id": "1929895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929895", "title": "National identity", "text": "National identity\n\nNational identity is a person's identity or sense of belonging to one state or to one nation. It is the sense of a nation as a cohesive whole, as represented by distinctive traditions, culture, language and politics. National identity may refer to the subjective feeling one shares with a group of people about a nation, regardless of one's legal citizenship status. National identity is viewed in psychological terms as \"an awareness of difference\", a \"feeling and recognition of 'we' and 'they'\".\n\nAs a collective phenomenon, national identity can arise as a direct result of the presence of elements from the \"common points\" in people's daily lives: national symbols, language, the nation's history, national consciousness, and cultural artefacts.\n\nThe expression of one's national identity seen in a positive light is patriotism which is characterized by national pride and positive emotion of love for one's country. The extreme expression of national identity is chauvinism, which refers to the firm belief in the country's superiority and extreme loyalty toward one's country.\n\nNational identity is not an inborn trait and it is essentially socially constructed. A person's national identity results directly from the presence of elements from the \"common points\" in people's daily lives: national symbols, language, colors, nation's history, blood ties, culture, music, cuisine, radio, television, and so on. Under various social influences, people incorporate national identity into their personal identities by adopting beliefs, values, assumptions and expectations which align with one’s national identity. People with identification of their nation view national beliefs and values as personally meaningful, and translate these beliefs and values into daily practices.\n\nPolitical scientist Rupert Emerson defined national identity as \"a body of people who feel that they are a nation\". This definition of national identity was endorsed by social psychologist, Henri Tajfel, who formulated social identity theory together with John Turner. Social identity theory adopts this definition of national identity, and suggests that the conceptualization of national identity includes both self-categorization and affect. Self-categorization refers to identifying with a nation and viewing oneself as a member of a nation. The affect part refers to the emotion a person has with this identification, such as a sense of belonging, or emotional attachment toward one's nation. The mere awareness of belonging to a certain group invokes positive emotions about the group, and leads to a tendency to act on behalf of that group, even when the other group members are sometimes personally unknown.\n\nNational identity requires the process of self-categorization and it involves both the identification of in-group (identifying with one's nation), and differentiation of out-groups (other nations). By recognizing commonalities such as having common descent and common destiny, people identify with a nation and form an in-group, and at the same time they view people that identify with a different nation as out-groups. Social identity theory suggests a positive relationship between identification of a nation and derogation of other nations. By identifying with one's nation, people involve in intergroup comparisons, and tend to derogate out-groups. However, several studies have investigated this relationship between national identity and derogating other countries, and found that identifying with national identity does not necessarily result in out-group derogation.\n\nNational identity, like other social identities, engenders positive emotions such as pride and love to one's nation, and feeling of obligations toward other citizens. The socialization of national identity, such as socializing national pride and a sense of the country's exceptionalism contributes to harmony among ethnic groups. For example, in the U.S, by integrating diverse ethnic groups in the overarching identity of being an American, people are united by a shared emotion of national pride and the feeling of belonging to the U.S, and thus tend to mitigate ethnic conflicts.\n\nNational identity can be most noticeable when the nation confronts external or internal enemy and natural disasters. An example of this phenomenon is the rise in patriotism and national identity in the U.S after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The identity of being an American is salient after the terrorist attacks and American national identity is evoked. Having a common threat or having a common goal unite people in a nation and enhance national identity.\n\nSociologist Anthony Smith argues that national identity has the feature of continuity that can transmit and persist through generations. By expressing the myths of having common descent and common destiny, people's sense of belonging to a nation is enhanced. However, national identities can disappear across time as more people live in foreign countries for a longer time, and can be challenged by supranational identities, which refers to identifying with a more inclusive, larger group that includes people from multiple nations.\n\nNational identity can be thought as a collective product. Through socialization, a system of beliefs, values, assumptions and expectations is transmitted to group members. The collective elements of national identity may include national symbols, traditions, and memories of national experiences and achievements. These collective elements are rooted in the nation's history. Depending on how much the individual is exposed to the socialization of this system, people incorporate national identity to their personal identity to different degrees and in different ways, and the collective elements of national identity may become important parts of individual's definition of the self and how they view the world and their own place in it.\n\nIn countries that have multiple ethnic groups, ethnic identity and national identity may be in conflict. These conflicts are usually referred to as ethno-national conflict. One of the famous ethno-national conflicts is the struggle between the Australian government and aboriginal population in Australia. The Australian government and majority culture imposed policies and framework that supported the majority, European-based cultural values and a national language as English. The aboriginal cultures and languages were not supported by the state, and were nearly eradicated by the state during the 20th century. Because of these conflicts, aboriginal population identify less or do not identify with the national identity of being an Australian, but their ethnic identities are salient.\n\nAs immigration increases, many countries face the challenges of constructing national identity and accommodating immigrants. Some countries are more inclusive in terms of encouraging immigrants to develop a sense of belonging to their host country. For example, Canada has the highest permanent immigration rates in the world. The Canadian government encourages immigrants to build a sense of belonging to Canada, and has fostered a more inclusive concept of national identity which includes both people born in Canada and immigrants. Some countries are less inclusive. For example, Russia has experienced two major waves of immigration influx, one in the 1990s, and the other one after 1998. Immigrants were perceived negatively by the Russian people and were viewed as \"unwelcome and abusive guests.\" Immigrants were considered outsiders and were excluded from sharing the national identity of belonging to Russia.\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly globalized, international tourism, communication and business collaboration has increased. People around the world cross national borders more frequently to seek cultural exchange, education, business, and different lifestyles. Globalization promotes common values and experiences, and it also encourages the identification with the global community. People may adapt cosmopolitanism and view themselves as global beings, or world citizens. This trend may threaten national identity because globalization undermines the importance of being a citizen of a particular country. Several researchers examined globalization and its impact on national identity found that as a country becomes more globalized, patriotism declined, which suggests that the increase of globalization is associated with less loyalty and less willingness to fight for one's own country. However, even a nation like Turkey that occupies an important geographic trade crossroads and international marketplace with a tradition of liberal economic activity with an ingrained entrepreneurial and foreign trade has degrees of ethnocentrism as Turkish consumers may be basically rational buyers by not discriminating against imported products, but they exhibit preferences for local goods that are of equal quality to the imports because buying them assists the nation's economy and domestic employment.\n\nIn some cases, national identity collides with a person's civil identity. For example, many Israeli Arabs associate themselves with the Arab or Palestinian nationality, while at the same time they are citizens of the state of Israel, which is in conflict with the Palestinian nationality. Taiwanese also face a conflict of national identity with civil identity as there have been movements advocating formal \"Taiwan Independence\" and renaming \"Republic of China\" to \"Republic of Taiwan.\" Residents in Taiwan are issued national identification cards and passports under the country name \"Republic of China\", and a portion of them do not identify themselves with \"Republic of China,\" but rather with \"Republic of Taiwan\".\n\nNational identity markers are those characteristics used to identify a person as possessing a particular national identity. These markers are not fixed but fluid, varying from culture to culture and also within a culture over time. Such markers may include common language or dialect, national dress, birthplace, family affiliation, etc.\n\n"}
{"id": "37689148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37689148", "title": "Neuroscience of sex differences", "text": "Neuroscience of sex differences\n\nNeuroscience of sex differences is the study of understanding the characteristics of the brain that separate the male brain and the female brain. Psychological sex differences are thought by some to reflect the interaction of genes, hormones and social learning on brain development throughout the lifespan.\n\nSome evidence from brain morphology and function studies indicates that male and female brains cannot always be assumed to be identical from either a structural or functional perspective, and some brain structures are sexually dimorphic.\n\nIdeas of differences in the male and female brain circulated during the time of ancient Greek philosophers around 850 B.C. Aristotle claimed that males did not \"receive their soul\" until 40 days post-gestation and females did not until 80 days. In 1854, Emil Huschke discovered that \"the frontal lobe in the male is all of 1% larger than that of the female.\" As the 19th century progressed, scientists began researching sexual dimorphisms in the brain significantly more. Until around 21 years ago, scientists knew of several structural sexual dimorphisms of the brain, but they did not think that sex had any impact on how the human brain performs daily tasks. Through molecular, animal, and neuroimaging studies, a great deal of information regarding the differences between male and female brains and how much they differ in regards to both structure and function has been uncovered.\n\nFemales show enhanced information recall compared to males. This may be due to the fact that females have a more intricate evaluation of risk-scenario contemplation, based on a prefrontal cortical control of the amygdala. For example, the ability to recall information better than males most likely originated from sexual selective pressures on females during competition with other females in mate selection. Recognition of social cues was an advantageous characteristic because it ultimately maximized offspring and was therefore selected for during evolution.\n\nOxytocin is a hormone that induces contraction of the uterus and lactation in mammals. It is also a characteristic hormone of nursing mothers. Studies have found that oxytocin improves spatial memory. Through activation of the MAP kinase pathway, oxytocin plays a role in the enhancement of long-term synaptic plasticity, which is a change in strength between two neurons over a synapse that lasts for minutes or longer, and long-term memory. This hormone may have helped mothers remember the location of distant food sources so they could better nurture their offspring.\n\nA popular theory regarding language functions suggests that women use both hemispheres more equally, whereas men are more strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere; however a 2008 meta-analysis of 29 studies comparing language lateralization in males and females found no overall difference.\n\nA 2016 meta-analysis found that the amygdala is not significantly larger in either sex. A 2008 meta-analysis of fMRI studies of amygdala activation found larger effect sizes in men compared with women.\n\nAmygdala volume correlates positively with fearfulness in girls but not in boys.\n\nIn fMRI studies, women display stronger activation in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex than men.\n\nA 2016 meta-analysis found that the hippocampus does not differ in volume between men and women.\n\nThere are sex differences in locus coeruleus dendritic structure that allow for an increased reception and processing of limbic information in females compared to males.\n\nAggressive and defiant behavior is also associated with decreased right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) volume in boys.\n\nIn a 2013 meta-analysis, researchers found on average males had larger grey matter (GM) volume in bilateral amygdalae, hippocampi, anterior parahippocampal gyri, posterior cingulate gyri, precuneus, putamen and temporal poles, areas in the left posterior and anterior cingulate gyri, and areas in the cerebellum bilateral VIIb, VIIIa and Crus I lobes, left VI and right Crus II lobes. On the other hand, females on average had larger grey matter volume at the right frontal pole, inferior and middle frontal gyri, pars triangularis, planum temporale/parietal operculum, anterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex, and Heschl's gyrus; bilateral thalami and precuneus; the left parahippocampal gyrus and lateral occipital cortex (superior division). The meta-analysis found larger volumes in females were most pronounced in areas in the right hemisphere related to language in addition to several limbic structures such as the right insular cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus.\n\nA 2014 meta-analysis found that although men and women commonly used the same brain networks for working memory, specific regions were sex specific. For example, both men and women's active working memory networks composed of bilateral middle frontal gyri, left cingulate gyrus, right precuneus, left inferior and superior parietal lobes, right claustrum, and left middle temporal gyrus but women also tended have consistent activity in the limbic regions such as the anterior cingulate, bilateral amygdala and right hippocampus while men tended to have a distributed networks spread out among the cerebellum, portions of the superior parietal lobe, the left insula and bilateral thalamus.\n\nA 2017 review from the perspective of large-scale brain networks, hypothesized that women's higher susceptibility to stress-prone diseases like PTSD and major depressive disorder, in which the salience network is theorized to be overactive and to interfere with the executive control network, may be due in part (along with societal exposure to stressors and the coping strategies that are available to women) to underlying sex-based brain differences.\n\nSteroid hormones have several effects on brain development as well as maintenance of homeostasis throughout adulthood. One effect they exhibit is on the hypothalamus, where they increase synapse formation. Estrogen receptors have been found in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, hippocampus, and frontal cortex, indicating the estrogen plays a role in brain development.  Gonadal hormone receptors have also been found in the basal fore-brain nuclei.\n\nEstradiol influences cognitive function, specifically by enhancing learning and memory in a dose-sensitive manner. Too much estrogen can have negative effects by weakening performance of learned tasks as well as hindering performance of memory tasks; this can result in females exhibiting poorer performance of such tasks when compared to males.\n\nIt has been suggested that during development, estrogen can exhibit both feminizing and defeminizing effects on the human brain; high levels of estrogen induce male neural traits to develop while moderate levels induce female traits. In females, defeminizing effects are resisted because of the presence of α-fetoprotein (AFP), a carrier protein proposed to transport estrogen into brain cells, allowing the female brain to properly develop. The role of AFP is significant at crucial stages of development, however. Prenatally, AFP blocks estrogen. Postnatally, AFP decreases to ineffective levels; therefore, it is probable that estrogen exhibits its effects on female brain development postnatally.\n\nOvariectomies, surgeries inducing menopause, or natural menopause cause fluctuating and decreased estrogen levels in women. This in turn can \"attenuate the effects\" of endogenous opioid peptides. Opioid peptides are known to play a role in emotion and motivation. β-endorphin (β-EP), an endogenous opioid peptide, content has been found to decrease (in varying amounts/brain region), post ovariectomy, in female rats within the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and pituitary gland. Such a change in β-EP levels could be the cause of mood swings, behavioral disturbances, and hot flashes in post menopausal women.\n\nTestosterone heavily influences male development; a study found that perinatal females introduced to elevated testosterone levels exhibited male behavior patterns. In the absence of testosterone, female behavior is retained.\nTestosterone's influence on the brain is caused by organizational developmental effects. It has been shown to influence proaptotic proteins so that they increase neuronal cell death in certain brain regions. Another way testosterone affects brain development is by aiding in the construction of the \"limbic hypothalamic neural networks\".\n\nOxytocin is positively correlated with maternal behaviours, social recognition, social contact, sexual behaviour and pair bonding. Oxytocin appears at higher levels in women than in men. Vasopressin on the other hand is more present in men and mediates sexual behavior, aggression and other social functions.\n\nIt was once thought that sex differences in cognitive task and problem solving did not occur until puberty. However, as of 2000 evidence suggested that cognitive and skill differences are present earlier in development. For example, researchers have found that three- and four-year-old boys were better at targeting and at mentally rotating figures within a clock face than girls of the same age were. Prepubescent girls, however, excelled at recalling lists of words. These sex differences in cognition correspond to patterns of ability rather than overall intelligence. Laboratory settings are used to systematically study the sexual dimorphism in problem solving task performed by adults.\n\nOn average, males excel relative to females at certain spatial tasks. Specifically, males have an advantage in tests that require the mental rotation or manipulation of an object. In a computer simulation of a maze task, males completed the task faster and with fewer errors than their female counterparts. Additionally, males have displayed higher accuracy in tests of targeted motor skills, such as guiding projectiles. Males are also faster on reaction time and finger tapping tests.\n\nOn average, females excel relative to males on tests that measure recollection. They have an advantage on processing speed involving letters, digits and rapid naming tasks. Females tend to have better object location memory and verbal memory. They also perform better at verbal learning. Females have better performance at matching items and precision tasks, such as placing pegs into designated holes. In maze and path completion tasks, males learn the goal route in fewer trials than females, but females remember more of the landmarks presented. This shows that females use landmarks in everyday situations to orient themselves more than males. Females are better at remembering whether objects had switched places or not.\n"}

At the banquet, for which a formal dress code exists, a multi-course dinner is served and entertainment provided. After the dinner, a dance is held in the Golden Hall. The event is broadcast live on SVT and Sveriges Radio, and abroad with generally high ratings.\n\nThe first banquet, for 113 male guests, was held in 1901 and until 1923 it was known as the Nobel Dinner (). Until 1930 the banquet was held in Vinterträdgården at Stockholm's Grand Hôtel Royal, and it has also been held in the Golden Hall of the Swedish Academy (Svenska Akademien).\n\nThe banquet hosts 1,300 guests (including the Swedish Royal Family) and 200 students. Its host, the chair of the Nobel Foundation, is always seated at the royal table.\n\nDuring the dinner (usually four hours long) each Nobel Prize recipient makes a speech, often lighthearted in character. There are two ceremonial cheers: one for the Swedish monarch and the other, made by the monarch, in memory of Alfred Nobel. The speeches and cheers are presented by the banquet's toastmaster, traditionally a Swedish student who holds the job for four years.\n\nService during the banquet is provided by waiting staff, chefs, and others who are trained for several weeks. Since the 1970s, flowers for the banquet have been provided by the Italian city of Sanremo (where Nobel lived during his final years).

{"id": "375113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=375113", "title": "Odal (rune)", "text": "Odal (rune)\n\nThe Elder Futhark Odal rune (), also known as the Othala rune, represents the \"o\" sound. Its reconstructed Proto-Germanic name is *\"ōþalan\" \"heritage; inheritance, inherited estate\".\n\nIt was in use for epigraphy during the 3rd to the 8th centuries. It is not continued in the Younger Futhark, disappearing from the Scandinavian record around the 6th century, but it survived in the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc, and expressed the Old English \"œ\" phoneme during the 7th and 8th centuries.\nIts name is attested as \"ēðel\" in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript tradition.\n\nThe rune is encoded in Unicode at code point U+16DF: .\n\nThe Common Germanic stem \"ōþala-\" or \"ōþila-\" \"inherited estate\" is an ablaut variant of the stem \"aþal-\". It consists of a root \"aþ-\" and a suffix \"-ila-\" or \"-ala-\". The suffix variant accounts for the umlauted form \"ēþel\". Germanic \"aþal‑\" had a meaning of (approximately) \"nobility\", and the derivation \"aþala‑\" could express \"lineage, (noble) race, descent, kind\", and thus \"nobleman, prince\" (whence Old English atheling), but also \"inheritance, inherited estate, property, possession\". Its etymology is not clear, but it is usually compared to \"atta\" \"father\" (cf. the name Attila, ultimately baby talk for \"father\").\n\nThere is an apparent, but debated, etymological connection of \"Odal\" to \"Adel\" (Old High German adal or edil), meaning \"nobility, noble family line, or exclusive group of superior social status; aristocracy\", typically associated with major land holdings and fortifications.\n\nThe term \"oþal\" (Old High German \"uodal\") is a formative element in some Germanic names, notably \"Ulrich\" and variants;, the stem \"aþal\" is more frequent, found in Gothic names such as Athalaric, Ataulf, etc. and in Old High German names such as \"Adalbert\", and\nAdel. Unrelated, but difficult to separate etymologically, is the root \"aud-\" \"wealth, property, possession, prosperity\"; from this root are names such as\n\"Edmund\" and other English names with the \"ed\" prefix (from Old English \"ead\"), German \"Otto\" and various Germanic names beginning with \"ed-\" or \"od-\". Possibly related is \"euþa, euþu\" a word for \"child, offspring\" (attested in Old Norse \"jóð\", and possibly in the name of the Iuthungi).\n\nOdal was associated with the concept of inheritance in ancient Scandinavian property law. Some of these laws are still in effect today, and govern Norwegian property. These are the \"Åsetesrett\" (homestead right), and the \"Odelsrett\" (allodial right).\n\nThe \"o\"-rune is attested early, in inscriptions from the 3rd century, such as the Thorsberg chape (DR7) and the Vimose planer (\"Vimose-Høvelen\", DR 206).\nThe letter is derived from a Raetian variant of the letter O. The corresponding Gothic letter is (derived from Greek Ω), which had the name \"oþal\".\n\nWolfgang Krause (1964) has speculated that the \"o\" rune is used as an ideograph denoting possession in the Thorsberg chape inscription. The inscription has \"owlþuþewaz\", read by Krause as \"O[þila] - W[u]lþu-þewaz\" \"inherited property - the servant of Wulþuz\".\n\nThe odal rune is found in some transitional inscriptions of the 6th or 7th century, such as the Gummarp, Björketorp and Stentoften runestones, but it disappears from the Scandinavian record by the 8th century. The Old Norse \"o\" phoneme is now written in Younger Futhark with the same letter as the \"u\" phoneme, the Ur rune.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon runes preserve the full set of 24 Elder Futhark runes (besides introducing innovations), but in some cases these runes are given new sound values due to Anglo-Frisian sound changes. The odal rune is such a case: the \"o\" sound in the Anglo-Saxon system is now expressed by \"ōs\" ᚩ, a derivation of the old Ansuz rune; the odal rune is now known as \"ēðel\" (with umlaut due to the form \"ōþila-\") and is used to express an \"œ\" sound, but is attested only rarely in epigraphy (outside of simply appearing in a futhark row). Epigraphical attestations include:\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon rune poem preserves the meaning \"an inherited estate\" for the rune name:\n\nThe rendition of the Odal rune with \"wings\" or \"feet\" (serifs) was the emblem of \"ethnic Germans\" (\"\") of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen operating during World War II in the Nazi Germany-sponsored Independent State of Croatia. This rendition has been used by the Neo-Nazi in Germany, and in South Africa by the Anglo-Afrikaner Bond, the , the , and the Italian neo-fascist group National Vanguard. This particular rendition has no historical significance outside of Nazi Germany. Because of its Nazi associations, \"Strafgesetzbuch 86a\" bans any usage of the Odal rune as with most other symbols if used in a Neo-Nazi context.\n\nAnother version with arrows on the end was used by the 23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division Nederland.\n\nIt was used by the Afrikaner Student Federation and the far-right wing White Liberation Movement. \nIn November 2016, the leadership of the National Socialist Movement announced their intention to replace the swastika with the Odal rune on their uniforms and party regalia in an attempt to enter mainstream politics.\n\nThe rendition of the Othala rune both with and without feet/wings (serifs) is used by Odinists and Asatruar interchangeably, usually without any relation to National Socialism or the Völkisch movement.\n\nThe Odal rune was used as one of the protection runes of the Shadowhunters in the film adaptation of the first in the series of Cassandra Clare books City of Bones. It was shown prominently on the character poster for Izzy, who wears it on her collarbone. It was also used throughout promotional material to highlight the stories themes of family and inheritance.\n\nAn instrumental track on Agalloch's second album, The Mantle, is called \"Odal\".\n\nThe 8th track of Wardruna's third album, Runaljod - Ragnarok, is called \"Odal\". The song ends with a long pronunciation of the name.\n\nIn April 2014, the British Topman clothing company were forced to apologize after using the Nazi version with wings/feet in one of their clothing lines.\n\nThe television show \"Sleepy Hollow\" used the version with wings/feet in season 3, calling it the emblem of Thura.\n\nThe superhero web serial \"Worm\" features a white supremacist supervillain called Othala, who wears the rune (with serifs) as her emblem.\n\nIn the second book in the Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard series by Rick Riordan, the Othala rune is translated as “inheritance.” This is particularly significant to Hearthstone, representing his brother’s death and his abuse at the hands of his father.\n"}
{"id": "23844652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23844652", "title": "Pawn Stars", "text": "Pawn Stars\n\nPawn Stars is an American reality television series, shown on History, and produced by Leftfield Pictures. The series is filmed in Las Vegas, Nevada, where it chronicles the daily activities at the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, a 24-hour family business opened in 1989 and originally operated by patriarch Richard \"Old Man\" Harrison, his son Rick Harrison, Rick's son Corey \"Big Hoss\" Harrison, and Corey's childhood friend, Austin \"Chumlee\" Russell. The series, which became the network's highest rated show and the No. 2 reality show behind \"Jersey Shore\", debuted on July 26, 2009.\n\nThe series depicts the staff's interactions with customers, who bring in a variety of artifacts to sell or pawn, and who are shown haggling over the price and discussing its historical background, with narration provided by either the Harrisons or Chumlee.\n\nThe series also follows the interpersonal conflicts among the cast. One reviewer referencing these conflicts described the show as a version of \"Antiques Roadshow\" \"hijacked by \"American Chopper\"s Teutul family\". \"TV Guide\" has offered a similar description, calling the show \"one part \"Antiques Roadshow\", a pinch of \"LA Ink\" and a dash of \"COPS\"\".\n\nNumerous local experts in a variety of fields also regularly appear to appraise the items being sold or pawned, two of whom have gone on to their own spin-off programs. Antique restorer/metal artist Rick Dale is the star of the series' first spin-off, \"American Restoration\", which premiered in October 2010, and mechanic/auto restoration expert Danny \"The Count\" Koker stars in the second spin-off, \"Counting Cars\", which debuted August 13, 2012.\n\n\"Pawn Stars\" began with Brent Montgomery and Colby Gaines of Leftfield Pictures, who were struck by the array of eclectic and somewhat seedy pawn shops in Las Vegas during a 2008 weekend visit to the city. Thinking such shops might contain unique characters, they searched for a family-run shop on which to center a TV series, until they found the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop less than two miles from the Las Vegas Strip. It had been the subject of a 2001 PBS documentary, and the manager and part-owner, Rick Harrison, had been trying unsuccessfully to pitch a show based on his shop for four years. The shop, and Rick, had previously been featured in the Las Vegas episode of \"Insomniac with Dave Attell\" in 2003.\n\nThe series was originally pitched to HBO, though the network preferred the series to have been a \"Taxicab Confessions\"-style series taking place at the Gold & Silver's night window. The format eventually evolved into the now-familiar family-oriented motif used on the series. History president Nancy Dubuc, who had been charged with creating programming with a more populist appeal to balance out the network's in-depth military programming, picked up the series, which was initially titled \"Pawning History\", before a staffer at Leftfield suggested that \"Pawn Stars\" would fit better with the locale. The network concurred, believing that name to be more pleasing and easily remembered. The staffer adjusted its story-line in order to bring it in line with the network's brand, which included the on-camera experts appraising the items brought into the Gold & Silver, though she did not discourage the interpersonal conflicts among the show's stars.\nThe series is filmed on location at the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas, Nevada. Although jewellery is the most commonly pawned item at the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, most of the customers featured in episodes bring in a variety of vintage or antique items to the store, which has 12,000 items in its inventory as of July 2011 (5,000 of which are typically held on pawn). Each episode consists of segments devoted to approximately five or six of these items, in which one of the staff members, usually Rick Harrison, his son Corey, or Harrison's father Richard (known as the \"Old Man\"), explains the history behind the object. When the buyer is unable to evaluate an object, they consult with a knowledgeable expert who can evaluate it to determine its authenticity and potential value, and in the case of items needing repair, the cost of restoration or preparing the item for sale. Whoever is evaluating the object goes over the potential value with the customer, including the expert's opinion, if one is given, often interspersed with an interview in which he explains the basis of his decision to the viewer. A price tag graphic at the bottom corner of the screen provides the ever-changing dollar amount as the two haggle over the item's price. On occasion, Rick will purchase items in need of restoration before determining its restoration costs, thus taking a risk on such costs.\n\nInterpersonal narratives focusing on the relationship and conflicts among Rick, Corey, the Old Man, and Corey's childhood friend, Austin \"Chumlee\" Russell, who also works at the shop, also comprise episode plots. These usually pertain to arguments over the running of the shop, the elder Harrisons questioning Corey's judgment, and aspersions cast on Chumlee's intelligence and competence. Before the second commercial break, a multiple choice trivia question related to the shop and its inventory, the cast members or one of the featured items is shown, with the answer provided after the break; beginning with the Season 8 episode \"A Very Vegas Christmas\", a trivia question is asked at every commercial break.\n\nIn addition to spawning imitators, such as the truTV series \"Hardcore Pawn\", the success of \"Pawn Stars\" has been a boon to the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, which has become a Las Vegas tourist site, and has expanded its business accordingly. Originally averaging between 70 and 100 customers per day, the shop's traffic increased to more than 1,000 by October 2010. To handle the increased business, the shop hired nearly 30 new employees, and underwent a $400,000 expansion of their showroom by two thirds, to 15,000 square feet, the shop's tenth expansion since it opened. Rick Harrison also mentioned in the fourth season episode \"Over the Top\" that he was building a gym above the Pawn Shop for the staff's use. The shop also now sells its own brand merchandise, whose designs originate from fans entering design competitions on Facebook, which saves the Harrisons the cost of hiring professional designers. The staff's presence on Facebook and Twitter also ensures audiences during local nightclub appearances, for which Corey Harrison and Chumlee Russell are paid $1,000 a night. As a result of filming at the shop, however, the four main cast members no longer work the counter, due to laws that require the identity of customers pawning items to remain confidential, and the tourists and fans taking photos and video in the showroom that would preclude this. When shooting episodes of the series, the shop is temporarily closed, with only a handful of customers allowed into the showroom.\n\nIn July 2011, Harrison signed a record-breaking 80-episode renewal contract for four more seasons of the series.\n\nAfter being broadcast during its first four years on Mondays at 10PM ET, the program moved to Thursday nights at 9PM ET on May 30, 2013, replacing \"Swamp People\", which moved an hour later to 10PM ET. The program also received a new opening and theme song, \"Winning isn't Everything\", performed by Lynyrd Skynyrd. The opening was replaced again with different theme music from an uncredited artist on June 12, 2014.\n\n\n\n\nProfessional specialists are sometimes called in by the pawn shop to determine the authenticity and value of the items brought in and, in some cases, to restore them. The following is a list of recurring experts who have appeared in two or more episodes.\n\nCameo appearances have been made by Phil Collen, Joe Elliott, Bob Dylan, Jeremy McKinnon, Meredith Vieira, the Oak Ridge Boys, George Stephanopoulos, Matt Kenseth, Steve Carell, Kip Winger, Roger Daltrey, Katie Couric, Vic Flick and Butch Harmon.\n\nBy January 2011, \"Pawn Stars\" was History's highest-rated series. An original episode broadcast on January 24, 2011 was watched by seven million viewers, the most-watched telecast ever on History, according to the network and Nielsen Media Research. In 2011 it was the second highest-rated reality series on TV behind \" Jersey Shore\", attracting 7.6 million viewers. In 2016, a \"New York Times\" study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that \"Pawn Stars\" was most popular in rural Kentucky.\n\nChristopher Long, reviewing the first season DVD for DVD Town, praised the series for its cast and the educational value of the items examined, calling it \"addictive\" and \"a big-time winner\", and opined that it is the best show on History and perhaps cable. In one issue of \"TV Guide\", writer Rob Moynihan included the show in a list of \"guilty pleasures.\" April McIntyre of Monsters and Critics, whose negative view of pawn shops influenced her view of the series' setting, reviewed one episode of the series, which she labeled a \"cool \"Antiques Roadshow\"\". Though she found aspects of it interesting, she criticized what she perceived as an emphasis on cheap laughs at the expense of family patriarch Richard Harrison over the show's historical material, as well as Corey Harrison's weight. She ultimately saw potential for the series if aspects of it that she found to be in poor taste were curbed. \"USA Today\"'s Gary Strauss opined that the bickering among the Harrisons, as well as the customers seen in the shop, is \"alternately amusing and grating\". \"People\" magazine wrote of the show, \"Think \"Antiques Roadshow\", but with neon and far more tattoos.\" Some of History's viewers were reportedly displeased with how reality series like \"Pawn Stars\" and \"Swamp People\" have replaced some of the network's previous history-oriented programming.\n\nThe series has also attracted some criticism from other pawnbrokers, who while conceding its entertainment value, claim that the series' focus on the extravagant vintage items brought into the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop are not typical of the average pawn shop, whose business is predicated on individuals on fixed income who bring in conventional objects in order to pay their bills, such as electronics, tools and jewelry. Corey Grigson and Charles Brown, who own a shop called Pawn Stars, estimate that their average loan to a customer is between $50 and $100. They also point out appraisals are handled by the staff, who rely on experience, reference works and research, and not the outside experts who are frequently seen on the show aiding the Harrisons.\n\nThe success of the series has also lent itself to parody. At the June 2011 NHL Awards in Las Vegas, the Hanson Brothers from the movie \"Slap Shot\" appeared in a spoof sketch in which they try to sell the Stanley Cup to Harrison at the Gold & Silver. The show has received 7.7/10 ratings on TV.com and has received 7.4/10 ratings on IMDb.\n\nIn 2010, Rick Harrison and the staff of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop were awarded the Pawnbroker of the Year Award by the National Pawnbrokers Association for bringing the industry greater recognition and a better image with the TV show.\n\nOn July 17, 2012, the Clark County Commission declared that day to be \"Pawn Stars/Gold & Silver Pawn Day\". At the Commission meeting, Richard \"The Old Man\" Harrison donated $1,000 to the Clark County Heritage Museum, and lent the U.S. Senate floor chair used by Senator Patrick McCarran (sold to the Gold and Silver in the \"Pawn Stars\" episode \"Take a Seat\") to the museum as part of a display on Senator McCarran.\n\nIn October 2012, A+E Networks and History, as well as cast members from the show, were sued in Clark County District Court in Las Vegas for interference with business practices by Wayne Jefferies, a Las Vegas promoter and the Harrisons' manager, who represented them and Austin Lee \"Chumlee\" Russell in their television business dealings. Jefferies, who was instrumental in helping to launch the series, states that after the show premiered, his influence in the show was increasingly reduced, and he was ultimately fired and left without his promised share of fees and merchandising royalties from the series. Jefferies states that this occurred after a January 2012 leaked story on TMZ that indicated that the \"Pawn Stars\" cast was taken aback by History's launch of the spinoff \"Cajun Pawn Stars\", of which the cast had been unaware.\n\nIn March 2016, \"Chumlee\" Russell pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the discovery of an arsenal of weapons, marijuana, and other drugs by police at his home in Las Vegas.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Pawn Stars\", Leftfield Pictures created the following spinoffs of \"Pawn Stars\":\n\n\nIn addition, Leftfield created five similar series that follow the same format as \"Pawn Stars\":\n\nIn 2011, History launched \"Pawn Stars: The Game\" for play on Facebook.\n\nIn June 2011, Rick Harrison's autobiography, \"License to Pawn: Deals, Steals, and My Life at the Gold & Silver\", was published by Hyperion Books. Harrison's autobiography details his childhood, some of the troubles he faced before he got into the pawning business, as well as anecdotes from his time at the Gold & Silver. Also, The Old Man, Corey, and Chumlee have their own chapters in the book, reflecting on their life and experiences at the pawn shop.\n\nIn October 2011, the Redwood Hills Financial Group issued the \"Modern Cash Prepaid MasterCard Limited Edition: Gold & Silver Pawn Shop\" prepaid debit card, in a special tie-in with the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop.\n\nOn September 5, 2012, it was announced that Bally Technologies would unveil a new slot machine featuring the cast of \"Pawn Stars\" the following month at the 2012 Global Gaming Expo. which took place October 2 to 4, 2012 in Las Vegas.\n\n\n"}

A member of the founding Assembly explained \" We had come together to say that the dirty war should come to an end and that there should be peace among Turks and Kurds.\" Many of the women involved have lost a close relative in the Kurdish–Turkish conflict. In the words of Türkiye Bozkurt \" In 1999 we came together as mothers, whose children were either in the mountains, in prisons or had lost their lives in the war.\" They are based in Istanbul and Diyarbakir.\n\nThey have been frequently in the news for their protests and court cases. In 2000, Amnesty International reported a delegation of Peace Mothers had allegedly been tortured and ill-treated, after they travelled to neighbouring Iraq to try to mediate between the two sides in the civil conflict in the Kurdish region in North Iraq. The lawyer who defended them, Eren Keskin, was later put on trial for having insulted the army after her description of the alleged torture of the Peace Mothers was published in a newspaper.\n\nIn June 2006, Peace Mother activists Muyesser Gunes and Sakine Arat were sentenced to 1-year jail each and 600 YTL in Ankara 4th Criminal Court on a charge of praising a separatist organisation and its leader, after they had visited the General Staff headquarters on 22 August 2005 to present their case. The sentence was later commuted to 10 months.\n\nIn July 2006, twenty-four Peace Mothers aged between 40 and 75 years, were sentenced to 12 months’ jail by the Diyarbakır 4th Criminal Court after being found guilty of voicing \"separatist propaganda\".\n\nIn August 2009 a group of Peace Mothers organised a peace march from Diyarbakir and Ankara and held a sit-in protest near the Turkish General Staff headquarters in Ankara.\n"}

She was married to poet-playwright Orrick Johns and writer Malcolm Cowley and was the lover of playwright Eugene O'Neill and poet Hart Crane.\n\nBaird was a member of the women's suffrage movement. In 1917, she invited Dorothy Day to join the National Woman's Party. They were jailed for 60 days for their protests but were released after 16 days and pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson.\n\nAfter divorcing her first husband, Johns, she married, in 1919, Malcolm Cowley. In 1931 she moved to Mexico to obtain a divorce. While there her long friendship with poet Hart Crane turned into Crane's first and only documented heterosexual affair. As Crane wrote to a friend about his romance with Peggy Cowley, \"Rather amazing things have happened to me since Xmas. Peggy Cowley ... is mainly responsible\". This affair has since become a major point of interest for Crane scholars—particularly for those reading him with an eye toward his sexuality—as his engagement with heterosexual life is a determining theme in his last major poem, \"The Broken Tower\". Appearing at moments to be a highly symbolic affirmation of their relationship, as well as a denial of his homosexual past (the 'broken tower' can be read as a defeated phallus), the poem was written just months before Crane committed suicide by jumping off the side of a boat in 1932, while on a trip to New York City.\n\nThough their relationship had begun to deteriorate by that time (Crane said he had \"misunderstood and misinterpreted Peggy's character quite badly\"), Cowley was with Crane on the boat, and she figures briefly, but poignantly, in the events leading up to his death. Almost thirty years later, she wrote about this period in an article for \"Venture\", \"The Last Days of Hart Crane.\"\n\nAfter Crane's death, Cowley married twice more and converted to Catholicism. Cowley died of cancer at Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker Farm in Tivoli, New York, where Cowley had resided for ten years.\n"}

The other two buddha types are the arhat and the \"sammāsambuddha\" (Sanskrit \"samyaksambuddha\").\n\nThe \"yāna\" or \"vehicle\" by which pratyekabuddhas achieve enlightenment is called the pratyekabuddhayāna in Indian Buddhist tradition.\n\nPratyekabuddhas are said to achieve enlightenment on their own, without the use of teachers or guides, according some traditions by seeing and understanding dependent origination. They are said to arise only in ages where there is no Buddha and the Buddhist teachings (Sanskrit: dharma; Pāli: \"dhamma\") are lost. \"The idea of a Paccekabuddha … is interesting, as much as it implies that even when the four truths are not preached they still exist and can be discovered by anyone who makes the necessary mental and moral effort\". Many may arise at a single time.\n\nAccording to the Theravada school, paccekabuddhas (\"one who has attained to supreme and perfect insight, but who dies without proclaiming the truth to the world\") are unable to teach the Dhamma, which requires the omniscience and supreme compassion of a sammāsambuddha, and even he hesitates to attempt to teach. Paccekabuddha give moral teachings but do not bring others to enlightenment. They leave no sangha as a legacy to carry on the Dhamma.\n\nIn the fourth-century Mahayana abhidharma work, the \"Abhidharma-samuccaya\", Asaṅga describes followers of the Pratyekabuddhayāna as those who dwell alone like a rhinoceros or as solitary conquerors (Skt. \"pratyekajina\") living in small groups. Here they are characterized as utilizing the same canon of texts as the śrāvakas, the Śrāvaka Piṭaka, but having a different set of teachings, the \"Pratyekabuddha Dharma\".\n\nA very early sutra, the \"Rhinoceros Sutra\", uses the exact metaphor of Asaṅga. The \"Rhinoceros Sutra\" is one of the Gandhāran Buddhist texts, which are the oldest Buddhist texts known. This text is also present in the Pāli Canon; in the Sutta Pitaka, a Pali \"Rhinoceros Sutta\" is the third sutta in the Khuddaka Nikaya's Sutta Nipata's first chapter (Sn 1.3).\n\nPratyekabuddhas (e.g. Darīmukha J.378, Sonaka J.529) appear as teachers of Buddhist doctrine in pre-Buddhist times in several of the Jataka tales.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5222720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5222720", "title": "Privacy law", "text": "Privacy law\n\nPrivacy law refers to the laws that deal with the regulating, storing, and using of personally identifiable information of individuals, which can be collected by governments, public or private organizations, or other individuals.\n\nPrivacy laws are considered within the context of an individual's privacy rights or within reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nPrivacy laws can be broadly classified into:\n\nAPEC created a voluntary Privacy Framework that was adopted by all 21 member economies in 2004 in an attempt to improve general information privacy and the cross-border transfer of information. The Framework consists of nine Privacy Principles that act as minimum standards for privacy protection: Preventing harm, Notice, Collection limitation, Use of personal information, Choice, Integrity of personal information, Security safeguards, Access and correction, and Accountability.\n\nIn 2011, APEC implemented the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System with the goal of balancing \"the flow of information and data across borders ... essential to trust and confidence in the online marketplace.\" The four agreed-upon rules of the System are based upon the APEC Privacy Framework and include self-assessment, compliance review, recognition/acceptance, and dispute resolution and enforcement.\n\nArticle 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was drafted and adopted by the Council of Europe in 1950 and currently covers the whole European continent except for Belarus and Kosovo, protects the right to respect for private life: \"Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\" Through the huge case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, privacy has been defined and its protection has been established as a positive right of everyone.\n\nThe Council of Europe also addressed privacy protection in regards to the Internet in 1998 when it published \"Draft Guidelines for the protection of individuals with regard to the collection and processing of personal data on the information highway, which may be incorporated in or annexed to Code of Conduct.\" The Council developed these guidelines in conjunction with the European Commission, and they were adopted in 1999.\n\nThe 1995 Data Protection Directive (officially Directive 95/46/EC) recognized the authority of National data protection authorities and required that all Member States adhere to universal privacy protection standards. Member States must adopt strict privacy laws that are no more relaxed than the framework provided by the directive. Additionally, the Directive outlines that non-EU countries must adopt privacy legislation of equal restriction in order to be allowed to exchange personal data with EU countries. Furthermore, companies in non-EU countries must also adopt privacy standards of at least equal restriction as provided in the Directive in order to do business with companies located in EU countries. Thus, the Directive has also influenced the development of privacy legislation in non-European countries. The proposed ePrivacy Regulation, which would replace the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002, also contributes to EU privacy regulations.\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation will replace the Data Protection Directive of 1995 when it takes effect on 25 May 2018. A notable contribution that will come from the General Data Protection Regulation is its recognition of a \"right to be forgotten\", which requires any group that collects data on individuals to delete the data related to an individual upon that individual's request. The Regulation was influenced by the aforementioned European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nIn 1980, the OECD adopted the voluntary OECD Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data in response to growing concerns about information privacy and data protection in an increasingly technological and connected world. The OECD Guidelines helped establish an international standard for privacy legislation by defining the term \"personal data\" and outlining fair information practice principles (FIPPs) that other countries have adopted in their national privacy legislation.\n\nIn 2007, the OECD adopted the Recommendation on Cross-border Co-operation in the Enforcement of Laws Protecting Privacy. This framework is based on the OECD Guidelines and includes two cooperation based model forms to encourage the enforcement of privacy laws among member states. The Recommendation is also notable for coining the term \"Privacy Enforcement Authority.\"\n\nArticle 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the United Nations of 1966 also protects privacy: \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.\"\n\nOn 18 December 2013, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 68/167 on the right to privacy in the digital age. The resolution makes reference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirms the fundamental and protected human right of privacy.\n\nFor a comprehensive global summary of data privacy laws (2017), click here to access Greenleaf's article documenting the change of privacy regulations throughout the international landscape.\n\nThe current state of privacy law in Australia includes Federal and state information privacy legislation, some sector-specific privacy legislation at state level, regulation of the media and some criminal sanctions. The current position concerning civil causes of action for invasion of privacy is unclear: some courts have indicated that a tort of invasion of privacy may exist in Australia. However this has not been upheld by the higher courts, which have been content to develop the equitable doctrine of Breach of Confidence to protect privacy, following the example set by the UK. In 2008, the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended the enactment of a statutory cause of action for invasion of privacy.\n\nThe Bahamas has an official data protection law that protects the personal information of its citizens in both the private and public sector: Data Protection Act 2003 (the Bahamas Law). The Bahamas Law appoints a data protection commissioner to the Office of Data Protection to ensure that data protection is being held. Even though there is legislation enforced in the Bahamas through the Data Protection Act 2003, the act lacks many enforcements since a data protection officer doesn't need to be in office nor does any group or organization need to notify the Office of Data Protection when a hacker has breached privacy law. Also, there are no requirements for registering databases or restricting data flow across national borders. Therefore, the legislation does not meet European Union standards, which was the goal of creating the law in the first place. \n\nThe Bahamas is also a member of CARICOM, the Caribbean Community.\n\nBelize is currently part of the minority of countries that do not have any official data privacy laws. However, the Freedom of Information Act (2000) currently protects the personal information of the citizens of Belize, but there is no current documentation that distinguishes if this act includes electronic data.\n\nAs a consequence of the lack of official data privacy laws, there was a breach of personal data in 2009 when an employee's laptop from Belize's Vital Statistics Unit was stolen, containing birth certification information for all citizens residing in Belize. Even though the robbery was not intentionally targeting the laptop - the robber did not predict the severity of the theft - Belize was put in a vulnerable position which could have been avoided if regulations were in order.\n\nA Brazilian citizen's privacy is protected by the country's constitution, which states:\n\nIn August 14th, 2018 Brazil enacted a full-fledged data protection bill. The bill has 65 articles and has many similarities to the GDPR. The first translation into English of the new data protection law was published by Ronaldo Lemos, a Brazilian lawyer specialized in technology, on that same date.\n\nIn Canada, the federal \"Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act\" (PIPEDA) governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in connection with commercial activities and personal information about employees of federal works, undertakings and businesses. It generally does not apply to non-commercial organizations or provincial governments. Personal information collected, used and disclosed by the federal government and many crown corporations is governed by the \"Privacy Act\". Many provinces have enacted similar provincial legislation such as the Ontario \"Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act\" which applies to public bodies in that province.\n\nThere remains some debate whether there exists a common law tort for breach of privacy. There have been a number of cases identifying a common law right to privacy but the requirements have not been articulated.\n\nIn \"Eastmond v. Canadian Pacific Railway & Privacy Commissioner of Canada\" Canada's Supreme Court found that CP could collect Eastmond's personal information without his knowledge or consent because it benefited from the exemption in paragraph 7(1)(b) of PIPEDA, which provides that personal information can be collected without consent if \"it is reasonable to expect that the collection with the knowledge or consent of the individual would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement\".\n\nComputer Processed Personal Information Protection Act was enacted in 1995 in order to protect personal information processed by computers. The general provision specified the purpose of the law, defined crucial terms, prohibited individuals from waiving certain rights.\n\nAn archipelago located in the Pacific, the country of Fiji was founded on the tenth of October 1970. In its constitution, the people inhabiting the land are granted the right to privacy. The exact workings from the constitution is the following: \"Every person has the right to personal privacy, which includes the right to — (a) confidentiality of their personal information; (b) confidentiality of their communications; and (c) respect for their private and family life\". But in this very same constitution, it is expressed that it is possible \"to the extent that it is necessary\" for a law to be passed that limits or impacts the execution of the right to privacy law. Another privacy related law can be seen in section 54 of the Telecommunications Promulgation passed in 2008, which states that \"any service provider supplying telecommunications to consumers must keep information about consumers confidential\". Billing information and call information are no exceptions. The only exception to this rule is for the purpose of bringing to light \"fraud or bad debt\". Under this law, even with the consent of the customer, the disclosure of information is not permitted. Other Privacy laws that have been adopted by this country are those that are meant to protect the collected information, cookies and other privacy-related matter of tourist. This is in regards to (but not limited to) information collected during bookings, the use of one technology of another that belongs to said company or through the use of a service of the company, or when making payments. Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, the Fiji is bound by the universal declaration of Human Rights which states in article two \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks\".\n\nFrance adopted a data privacy law in 1978. It applies to public and private organizations and forbids gathering sensitive data about physical persons (sexuality, ethnic, political or religious opinions ...). The law is administered by the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (CNIL), a dedicated national administration.\n\nGermany is known to be one of the first countries (in 1970) with the strictest and most detailed data privacy laws in the world. The citizens' right to protection is stated in the Constitution of Germany, in Art. 2 para. 1, and Art. 1 para. 1. The citizens' data of Germany is mainly protected under the Federal Data Protection Act (1977) from corporations, which has been amended the most recently in 2009. This act specifically targets all businesses that collect information for its use. The major regulation protects the data within the private and personal sector, and as a member of the European Union (EU), Germany has additionally ratified its act, convention, and additional protocol with the EU according to the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC.\n\nIn Germany, there are two kinds of restrictions on a transfer of personal data. Since Germany is part of the EU Member States, the transfer of personal data of its citizens to a nation outside the EEA is always subject to a decent level of data protection in the offshore country. Secondly, according to German data policy rules, any transfer of personal data outside the EEA symbolizes a connection to a third party which requires a reason. That reason may be for emergency reasons and a provision must be met with consent by the receiver and the subject of the data. Keep in mind that in Germany, data transfers within a group of companies are subject to same treatment as transfer to third-parties if the location is outside the EEA.\n\nSpecifically the Federal Data Protection Commission is in charge of regulating the entirety of the enforcement of data privacy regulations for Germany. In addition, Germany is part of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Federal Data Protection Commission of Ireland is a member of the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, European Data Protection Authorities, the EU Article 29 Working Party, and the Global Privacy Enforcement Network.\n\nRegarding the protection of children, Germany is potentially the first nation that has played an active role in banning the share of data within toys connected to Wifi and the Internet, like for instance, \"My Friend Cayla\". The group in charge of protecting the data of children is the Federal Network Agency (the Bundessnetzagentur). \n\nDuring the military dictatorship era the 57 AK law prohibited taking photos of people without their permission but the law has since been superseded. The 2472/1997 law protects personal data of citizens but consent for taking photos of people is not required as long as they aren't used commercially or are used only for personal archiving (\"οικιακή χρήση\" / \"home use\"), for publication in editorial, educational, cultural, scientific or news publications, and for fine art purposes (e.g. street photography which has been uphold as legal by the courts whether done by professional or amateur photographers). However, photographing people or collecting their personal data for commercial (advertising) purposes requires their consent. The law gives photographers the right to commercially use photos of people who have not consented to the use of the images in which they appear if the depicted people have either been paid for the photo session as models (so there is no separation between editorial and commercial models in Greek law) or they have paid the photographer for obtaining the photo (this, for example, gives the right to wedding photographers to advertise their work using their photos of newly-wed couples they photographed in a professional capacity). In Greece the right to take photographs and publish them or sell licensing rights over them as fine art or editorial content is protected by the Constitution of Greece (Article 14 and other articles) and free speech laws as well as by case law and legal cases. Photographing the police or children and publishing the photographs in a non-commercial capacity is also legal.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the law governing the protection of personal data is principally found in the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) which came into force on 20 December 1996. Various amendments were made to enhance the protection of personal data privacy of individuals through the Personal Data (Privacy) (Amendment) Ordinance 2012. Examples of personal data protected include names, phone numbers, addresses, identity card numbers, photos, medical records and employment records. As Hong Kong remains a common law jurisdiction, judicial cases are also a source of privacy law. The power of enforcement is vested with the Privacy Commissioner (the \"Commissioner\") for Personal Data. Non-compliance with data protection principles set out in the ordinances does not constitute a criminal offense directly. The Commissioner may serve an enforcement notice to direct the data user to remedy the contravention and/or instigate the prosecution action. Contravention of an enforcement notice may result in a fine and imprisonment.\n\nThe Right to Privacy is a fundamental right and an intrinsic part of Article 21 that protects life and liberty of the citizens and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. In June 2011, India passed a new privacy package that included various new rules that apply to companies and consumers. A key aspect of the new rules requires that any organization that processes personal information must obtain written consent from the data subjects before undertaking certain activities. Application of the rule is still uncertain. The Aadhar Card privacy issue became controversial when the case reached the Supreme Court.. The hearing in the Aadhaar case went on for 38 days across 4 months making it second longest SC hearing after the landmark Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala.\n\nOn August 24, 2017, a nine-judge bench of Supreme Court in Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India And Ors. unanimously held that the right to privacy is an intrinsic part of right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.\n\nPreviously, the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 made changes to the Information Technology Act, 2000 and added the following two sections relating to Privacy:\n\nThe island of Ireland is under the Data Protection Act 1988 and amended by the Data Protection Act 2003 along with the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC, which regulates the utilization of personal data. Data Protection Act 1988 along with 2003 is known as the DPA and protects data within the private and personal sector. The DPA ensures that when data is transported, the location must be safe and in acknowledgement of the legislation to maintain data privacyWhen collecting and processing data, some of the requirements are listed below:\nSpecifically the Data Protection Commissioner oversees the entirety of the enforcement of data privacy regulations for Ireland. All persons that collect and process data must register with the Data Protection Commissioner unless they are exempt (non-profit organizations etc.) and renew their registration annually.\n\nConsidering the protection of internet property and online data, the ePrivacy Regulations 2011 protects the communications and higher-advanced technical property and data such as social media and the telephone.\n\nIn relation to international data privacy law that Ireland is involved in, the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 Section 51 extensively states the relationship between data security between the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nIn addition, Ireland is part of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThe Data Protection Commissioner of Ireland is a member of the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, European Data Protection Authorities, the EU Article 29 Working Party, Global Privacy Enforcement Network, and the British, Irish, and Islands Data Protection Authorities.\n\nIreland is also the main international location for social media platforms, specifically LinkedIn and Twitter, for data collection and control for any data processed outside the United States.\n\nThe Jamaican constitution grants its people the right to \"respect for and protection of private and\nfamily life, and privacy of the home\". Although the government grants its citizens the right to privacy, the protection of this right is not strong. But in regards to other privacy laws that has been adopted in the country of Jamaica, the closest one is the Private Security Regulation Authority Act. This act passed in the year 1992, established the Private Security Regulation Authority. This organization is tasked with the responsibility of regulating the private security business and ensuring that everyone working as a private security guard is trained and certified. The goal of this is to ensure a safer home, community, and businesses. One of the reasons as to why this law was passed is that as trained workers, the guards could ensure maximum Customer service and also with the education they received they would be equipped how best to deal with certain situations as well as avoid actions can that could be considered violations, such as invasion of privacy. Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, the Jamaica is bound by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states in article two \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks\".\n\nThe Act on the Protection of Personal Information was fully enacted in 2005 to protect the rights and interests of individuals while taking consideration of the usefulness of personal information. The law applies to business operators that hold the personal information of 5,000 or more individuals.\n\nKenya at the moment does not have a strong general privacy protection law for its constituents. But in chapter 4 — The Bill of Rights and in the second part which is titled \"Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,\" of the consitiution privacy is allocated its own section. There we see that the Kenyan government express that all its people have the right to privacy, \"... which includes the right not to have — (a) their person, home or property searched; (b) their possessions seized; (c) information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed, or (d) the privacy of their communications infringed\". Now with that said, though this country grants its people the right to privacy, there seems to be no document out there that protect these specific privacy laws privacy laws. Regarding privacy laws relating to data privacy, like many African countries as expressed by Alex Boniface Makulilo, Kenya's privacy laws are far from the European 'adequacy' standard\". Kenya is making progress. As of today, the country does have laws that focus on specific sectors. The following are the sectors: communication and information. The law pertaining to this is called the Kenya Information and Communication Act. This Act makes it illegal for any licensed telecommunication operators to disclose or intercept information that is able to get access through the customer's use of the service. This law also grants privacy protection in the course of making use of the service provided by said company. And if the information of the customer is going to be provided to any third party it is mandatory that the customer is made aware of such an exchange and that some form of agreement is reached, even if the person is a family member. This act also goes as far as protecting data for Kenyans especially for the use of fraud and other ill manners. Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, Kenya is bound by the universal declaration of Human Rights which states in article two \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks\".\n\nAfter their independence from Great Britain in 1957, Malaysia's existing legal system was based primarily on English common law. The following common law torts are related to personal information privacy and continue to play a role in Malaysia's legal system: breach of confidence, defamation, malicious falsehood, and negligence. In recent years, however, the Court of Appeal in Malaysia has referred less to English common law and instead looked more toward other nations with similar colonial histories and whose written constitutions are more like the Malaysian Constitution. Unlike the courts in these other nations, such as India's Supreme Court, the Malaysian Court of Appeal has not yet recognized a constitutionally protected right to privacy.\n\nIn June 2010, the Malaysian Parliament passed the Personal Data Protection Act 2010, and it came into effect in 2013. It outlines seven Personal Data Protection Principles that entities operating in Malaysia must adhere to: the General Principle, the Notice and Choice Principle, the Disclosure Principle, the Security Principle, the Retention Principle, the Data Integrity Principle, and the Access Principle. The Act defines personal data as \"'information in respect of commercial transactions that relates directly or indirectly to the data subject, who is identified or identifiable from that information or from that and other information.\"\n\nA notable contribution to general privacy law is the Act's distinction between personal data and sensitive personal data, which entails different protections. Personal data includes \"information in respect of commercial transactions ... that relates directly or indirectly to a data subject\" while sensitive personal data includes any \"personal data consisting of information as to the physical or mental health or condition of a data subject, his political opinions, his religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature.\" Although the Act does not apply to information processed outside the country, it does restrict cross-border transfers of data from Malaysia outwards. Additionally, the Act offers individuals the \"right to access and correct the personal data held by data users\", \"the right to withdraw consent to the processing of personal data\", and \"the right to prevent data users from processing personal data for the purpose of direct marketing.\" Punishment for violating the Personal Data Protection Act can include fines or even imprisonment.\n\nOther common law and business sector-specific laws that exist in Malaysia to indirectly protect confidential information include:\n\nOn 5 July 2010, Mexico enacted a new privacy package focused on treatment of personal data by private entities. The key elements included were:\n\nIn New Zealand, the Privacy Act 1993 sets out principles in relation to the collection, use, disclosure, security and access to personal information.\n\nThe introduction into the New Zealand common law of a tort covering invasion of personal privacy at least by public disclosure of private facts was at issue in \"Hosking v Runting\" and was accepted by the Court of Appeal. In \"Rogers v TVNZ Ltd\" the Supreme Court indicated it had some misgivings with how the tort was introduced, but chose not to interfere with it at that stage.\n\nComplaints about privacy are considered by the \"Privacy Commissioner\"\n\nFederal Republic of Nigeria's constitution offers its constituents the right to privacy as well as privacy protection. The following can be found in the constitution pertaining to this: \"The privacy of citizens, their homes, correspondence, telephone conversations and telegraphic communications is hereby guaranteed and protected\". Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, Nigeria is bound by the universal declaration of Human Rights which states in article twelve \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks\". Nigeria is one of the few African countries that is building on the privacy laws. This is evident in the fact that Nine years later in the year 2008, the Cybersecurity and Information Protection Agency Bill was passed. This bill is responsible for the creation of the Cybersecurity and Information Protection Agency. This agency is tasked with the job of preventing cyberattacks and regulating the Nigerian information technology industry. Additional laws have been passed that are meant to prevent the disclosure of information without permission and the intercepting of some form of transaction with or without evil intent.\n\nIn Article III, Section 3, paragraph 1 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines lets its audience know that \"The privacy of communication and correspondence shall be inviolable except upon lawful order of the court, or when public safety or order requires otherwise as prescribed by law\". Not only does this country grant the Filipinos the right to privacy, but it also protects its people's right to privacy by attaching consequences to the violation of it thereof. In the year 2012, the Philippines passed the Republic Act No. 10173, also known as the \"Data Privacy Act of 2012\". This act extended privacy regulations and laws to apply to more than just individual industries. This act also offered protection of data belonging to the people regardless of where it is stored, be it in private spheres or not. In that very same year, the cybercrime prevention law was passed. This law was \"intended to protect and safeguard the integrity of computer and communications systems\" and prevent them from being misused. Not only does the Philippines have these laws, but it has also set aside agents that are tasked with regulating these privacy rules and due ensure the punishment of the violators. Additionally, with the constitution, previous laws that have been passed but that are in violation of the laws above have been said to be void and nullified. Another way this country has shown their dedication in executing this law is extending it to the government sphere as well. Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, the Philippines is bound by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states in article two \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks\".\n\nApplicable legislation:\n\nAs a general rule, consent of the individual is required for processing, i.e. obtaining, organizing, accumulating, holding, adjusting (updating, modifying), using, disclosing (including transfer), impersonating, blocking or destroying of his personal data. This rule doesn't apply where such processing is necessary for performance of the contract, to which an individual is a party.\n\nSingapore, like other Commonwealth jurisdictions, relies primarily on common law, and the law of confidence is employed for privacy protection cases. For example, privacy can be protected indirectly through various common law torts: defamation, trespass, nuisance, negligence, and breach of confidence. In February 2002, however, the Singaporean government decided that the common law approach was inadequate for their emerging globalized technological economy. Thus, the National Internet Advisory Committee published the Model Data Protection Code for the Private Sector, which set standards for personal data protection and was influenced by the EU Data Protection Directive and the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy. In the private sector, businesses can still choose to adopt the Model Code, but in 2005 Parliament decided that Singapore needed a more comprehensive legislative privacy framework.\n\nIn January 2013, Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act 2012 came into effect in three separate but related phases. The phases continued through July 2014 and dealt with the creation of the Personal Data Protection Commission, the national Do Not Call Registry, and general data protection Rules. The Act's general purpose \"is to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations\" while acknowledging the individual's right to control their personal data and the organizations' legal needs to collect this data. It imposes eight obligations on those organizations that use personal data: consent, purpose limitation, notification, access, correction, accuracy, protection/security, and retention. The Act prohibits transfer of personal data to countries with privacy protection standards that are lower than those outlined in the general data protection rules. The Personal Data Protection Commission is responsible for enforcing the Act, which is based primarily on a complaints-based system. The punishments for violating the Act can include being ordered by the Commission to stop collecting and using personal data, to destroy the data, or to pay a penalty of up to $1 million.\n\nSingapore has also passed various sector-specific statutes that more indirectly deal with privacy and personal information, including:\n\nThere are also more specific acts for electronically stored information:\n\nThe Constitution of South Africa guarantees the most general right to privacy for all its citizens. This provides the main protection for personal data privacy so far.\n\nThe Protection of Personal Act 2013 (POPI) was signed into act, focusing on data privacy and is inspired by other foreign national treaties like the United Kingdom. Minimum requirements are presented in POPI for the act of processing personal data, like the fact that the data subject must provide consent and that the data will be beneficial, and POPI will be harsher when related to cross-border international data transfers, specifically with personal information. However, POPI won't be in full effective until an estimated date of 2018 as it is still being deliberated by the National Council of Provinces.\n\nThe recording of conversations over phone and internet is not allowed without the permission of both parties with the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communications Related Act (2002).\n\nIn addition, South Africa is part of the Southern African Development Community and the African Union.\n\nThe Data Act is the world's first national data protection law and was enacted in Sweden on 11 May 1973. The law was then superseded on 24 October 1998 by the Personal Data Act (Sw. \"Personuppgiftslagen\") that implemented the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive.\n\nThe main legislation over personal data privacy for the personal and private sector in Switzerland is the Swiss Federal Protection Act, specifically the Data Protection Act, a specific section under the Swiss Federal Protection Act. The Data Protection Act has been enacted since 1992 and is in charge of measuring the consent of sharing of personal data, along with other legislation like the Telecommunication Act and the Unfair Competition Act. The Act generally guides on how to collect, process, store, data, use, disclose, and destruct data. The Data Inspection Board is in charge of overseeing data breaches and privacy enforcement.\n\nPersonal data must be protected against illegal use by \"being processed in good faith and must be proportionate\". Also, the reason for the transfer of personal data must be known by the time of data transfer. Data not associated with people (not personal data) is not protected by the Data Protection Act.\n\nIn the case of data transfer to unsafe data protection countries, these are the major regulations required by the Data Protection Act:\n\nSwitzerland is a white-listed country, meaning that it is a nation that has proper levels of data protection under the surveillance by the European Commission (EU Commission). Switzerland is not under the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC. However, the data protection regulations are sufficient enough under European Union (EU) regulations without being a member of the EU.\n\nIn addition, Switzerland is part of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThe Data Inspection Board of Switzerland is a member of the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, European Data Protection Authorities, the EU Article 29 Working Party, and the Nordic Data Protection Authorities.\n\nThe right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the Republic of China Constitution, but it can be protected indirectly through judicial interpretation. For example, article 12 of the Constitution states \"the people shall have freedom of confidentiality of correspondence\" while article 10 states \"the people shall have freedom of residence and of change of residence.\" Along with several other articles that assert the Constitution's protection of freedoms and rights of the people, the Grand Justices are able to decide how privacy protection fits into the legal system. The Justices first made reference to privacy being a protected right in the 1992 \"Interpretation of Council of Grand Justices No. 293 on Disputes Concerning Debtors' Rights,\" but it was not directly or explicitly declared to be a right.\n\nIn 1995, Taiwan passed the Computer-Processed Personal Data Protection Act which was influenced by the OECD Guidelines and enforced by each separate Ministry depending on their industry sector responsibility. It only protected personal information managed by government agencies and certain industries. In 2010, Taiwan enacted the Personal Data Protection Act that laid out more comprehensive guidelines for the public and private sectors and was still enforced by individual Ministries. In the 2010 Act, personal data is protected and defined as any \"data which is sufficient to, directly or indirectly, identify that person\", and includes data such as name, date of birth, fingerprints, occupation, medical records, and financial status, among many others.\n\nA few other administrative laws also deal with communication-specific personal privacy protection:\n\nAdditionally, chapter 28 of the Criminal Code outlines punishments for privacy violations in article 315, sections 315-1 and 315-2. The sections primarily address issues of search and seizure and criminal punishment for wrongful invasion of privacy.\n\nFinally, articles 18(I),184(I), and 195(I) of the Taiwanese address the \"personality right\" to privacy and the right to compensation when one injures the \"rights\" of another, such as when someone uses another's name illegally.\n\nThailand's unique history of being an authoritarian buffer state during the Cold War and being under the constant threat of a coup d'état means that privacy laws have so far been limited in order to preserve national security and public safety. Thailand uses bureaucratic surveillance to maintain national security and public safety, which explains the 1991 Civil Registration Act that was passed to protect personal data in computerized record-keeping and data-processing done by the government.\n\nThe legislature passed the Official Information Act 1997 to provide basic data protection by limiting personal data collection and retention in the public sector. It defines personal information in a national context in relation to state agencies. Two communication technology related laws, the Electronic Transactions Act 2001 and the Computer Crime Act 2007, provide some data privacy protection and enforcement mechanisms. Nevertheless, Thailand still lacks legislation that explicitly addresses privacy security.\n\nThus, with the need for a more general and all-encompassing data protection law, the legislature proposed the Personal Data Protection Bill in 2013, which is heavily influenced by the OECD Guidelines and the EU Directive. The draft law is still under evaluation and its enactment date is not yet finalized.\n\nAs a member of the European Convention on Human Rights, the United Kingdom adheres to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees a \"right to respect for privacy and family life\" from state parties, subject to restrictions as prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society towards a legitimate aim.\n\nHowever, there is no independent tort law doctrine which recognises a right to privacy. This has been confirmed on a number of occasions.\n\nThe right to privacy is not explicitly stated anywhere in the Bill of Rights.\nThe idea of a right to privacy was first addressed within a legal context in the United States. Louis Brandeis (later a Supreme Court justice) and another young lawyer, Samuel D. Warren, published an article called \"The Right to Privacy\" in the \"Harvard Law Review\" in 1890 arguing that the United States Constitution and common law allowed for the deduction of a general \"right to privacy\".\n\nTheir project was never entirely successful, and the renowned tort expert and Dean of the College of Law at University of California, Berkeley, William Lloyd Prosser argued that \"privacy\" was composed of four separate torts, the only unifying element of which was a (vague) \"right to be left alone\". The four torts were:\nOne of the central privacy policies concerning minors is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires children under the age of thirteen to gain parental consent before putting any personal information online.\n\nFor additional information on Privacy laws in the United States, see:\n\nThough the right to privacy exists in several regulations, the most effective privacy protections come in the form of constitutional articles of Uzbekistan. Varying aspects of the right to privacy are protected in different ways by different situations.\n\nVietnam, lacking a general data protection law, relies on Civil Code regulations relating to personal data protection. Specifically, the Code \"protects information relating to the private life of a person.\" The 2006 Law on Information Technology protects personal information, such as name, profession, phone number, and email address, and declares that organizations may only use this information for a \"proper purpose\". The legislation, however, does not define what qualifies as proper. The 2005 Law on Electronic Transactions protects personal information during electronic transactions by prohibiting organizations and individuals from disclosing \"part or all of information related to private and personal affairs ... without prior agreement.\" The 2010 Law on Protection of Consumers' Rights provides further protection for consumer information, but it does not define the scope of that information or create a data protection authority; additionally, it is only applicable in the private sector.\n\nIn 2015, the Vietnam legislature introduced the Law on Information Security, which ensures better information safety and protection online and in user's computer software. It took effect on 1 July 2016 and is Vietnam's first overarching data protection legislation.\n\n\"Source\"\n\n"}

In March 1923 between 80 and 100 suspected Irish nationalists in Britain were arrested by the police and sent to the Irish Free State under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 (ROIA). One of the detainees, Art O'Brien, challenged his detention in a test case at the Divisional Court. The case eventually went to both the Court of Appeal and House of Lords, who decided that the internments were illegal because the Irish Free State was an independent nation and so British Acts of Parliament no longer applied to it.\n\nThe decision effectively illegalised the ROIA and led to the immediate release of O'Brien and the other detained individuals, who sued the British Government for false imprisonment. The government pushed through the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923, which limited the money they had to pay the detainees, who eventually received £43,000. O'Brien himself was re-arrested and found guilty of sedition, and was imprisoned until 1924.\n\nFollowing the Irish War of Independence the Irish Free State was set up as an independent British Dominion covering most of the island of Ireland. After a brief civil war between the pro-Free State forces and members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA forced underground. The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the Irish Self-Determination League (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them. Between February and March they provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil. On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL. Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty or approximately 100. The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a Royal Navy destroyer. It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England), at least six had never even been to Ireland before.\n\nThe next day the arrests were publicly queried in the House of Commons, and a Labour backbencher Jack Jones started a debate on the subject in the afternoon. W.C. Bridgeman, the Home Secretary, said that he had directly ordered the police to arrest the ISDL members under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920, and that he had consulted the Attorney General who considered it legal.\n\nA few days after the arrests the solicitors for one of the deported men, Art O'Brien, got in contact with Sir Patrick Hastings KC, a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party and a noted barrister. On 23 March 1923 Hastings represented O'Brien in front of a Divisional Court consisting of Mr Justice Avory and Mr Justice Salter to apply for a writ of \"habeas corpus\" for O'Brien as a test case to allow the release of the others. The initial hearing did not go anywhere because Hastings was unable to provide an affidavit from O'Brien (who was in Mountjoy Prison), which was required for a writ of \"habeas corpus\" to be considered, but by the time the hearing was resumed on 10 April he had managed to obtain one. Hastings argued that because the Irish Free State was an independent nation the British laws governing it, such as the 1920 act, were effectively repealed. In addition the Home Secretary had no power to order an individual to be detained overseas because he had no control over what happened to them there.\n\nThe court eventually declared that they could not issue a writ, because the Habeas Corpus Act 1862 prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional Court could not act. Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O'Brien.\n\nThe decision was then appealed to the Court of Appeal and argued on 23 and 24 April. The Court of Appeal reversed the Divisional Court's decision. The court decided that the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 had been implicitly repealed when the Irish Free State, an independent nation, came into existence. In addition it was not proper for the Home Secretary to order the detention and deportation of someone overseas, since they had no control over what happened to them. It was completely appropriate to issue a writ of \"habeas corpus\" against the Home Secretary because, even though he did not physically have O'Brien, he was considered responsible for him. The Home Secretary was accordingly ordered to produce O'Brien before the court on 16 May.\n\nHe appealed to the House of Lords, who decided (led by Lord Birkenhead) that they did not have the jurisdiction to hear the appeal, since a rule of English law specifies that once a writ of \"habeas corpus\" is issued (as it was by the Court of Appeal) no superior court can overrule it. After a further attempt to keep O'Brien in custody (simply by not letting him out of prison) he was finally released on 16 May.\n\nO'Brien immediately sued the British Government for false imprisonment, and to avoid any liability the government prepared the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923 which would indemnify them against any claims for damages by the imprisoned sympathisers. The Labour Party whittled it down when it was being prepared so that it would only limit compensation rather than remove it entirely. A tribunal was set up under Lord Atkin to assess damages, and the sympathisers as a whole were eventually paid £43,000. Art O'Brien himself was arrested soon after release and convicted of sedition. He was released in 1924.\n\n"}

The origins of Rav akçesi are unclear; it has been suggested that it was one of two taxes imposed specifically on Jews, and that it may have developed in parallel with the authority of a senior rabbi in Istanbul, who was at nominally a representative and judge for Jewish communities in the Ottoman empire, although their authority may not have extended far beyond Istanbul.\n\nIt has been suggested that Mehmet II imposed the tax in return for separate representation of Jews after 1455, as part of a broader effort to rebuild and revive Istanbul; this may also have served to undermine the Greek patriarchy. Under the Ottoman empire there was, at time, friction between \"Greeks\" and \"Jews\"; the authorities may at times have favoured one over the other.\n\nAlthough \"rav akçesi\" was a cash tax, rather than a tax in kind, it could be hypothecated to provide specific goods; tax records for 1655 show that the rav akçesi in Monastir (Bitola) was a significant source of funding of drapery for janissaries; the tax official responsible for purchases would be the same person responsible for collecting the tax.\n\nNon-Muslims were usually taxed at a higher rate, overall, in the Ottoman empire, thanks to taxes such as rav akçesi and ispence. Jews in particular may have been singled out to pay higher rates of ispence. The Porte was well aware of this - and even aware that this would tempt nonmuslims to convert; Bayezit II ruled that courts should treat nonmuslims more leniently (including such measures as lower fines), \"so that the poll-tax payers shall not vanish\".\n\nAs with other taxes in the Ottoman empire, rav akçesi could be affected by a complex patchwork of local rules and exemptions, including muafiyet; the Jews of Selanik (Thessaloniki) were among those exempted from taxes by a muafname after the city was conquered by Murad II.\n\n"}
{"id": "4120782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4120782", "title": "Relativistic dynamics", "text": "Relativistic dynamics\n\n\"For classical dynamics at relativistic speeds, see relativistic mechanics.\"\n\nRelativistic dynamics refers to a combination of relativistic and quantum concepts to describe the relationships between the motion and properties of a relativistic system and the forces acting on the system. What distinguishes relativistic dynamics from other physical theories is the use of an invariant scalar evolution parameter to monitor the historical evolution of space-time events. In a scale-invariant theory, the strength of particle interactions does not depend on the energy of the particles involved.\nTwentieth century experiments showed that the physical description of microscopic and submicroscopic objects moving at or near the speed of light raised questions about such fundamental concepts as space, time, mass, and energy. The theoretical description of the physical phenomena required the integration of concepts from relativity and quantum theory.\n\nVladimir Fock was the first to propose an evolution parameter theory for describing relativistic quantum phenomena, but the evolution parameter theory introduced by Ernst Stueckelberg is more closely aligned with recent work. Evolution parameter theories were used by Feynman, Schwinger and others to formulate quantum field theory in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Silvan S. Schweber wrote a nice historical exposition of Feynman’s investigation of such a theory. A resurgence of interest in evolution parameter theories began in the 1970s with the work of Horwitz and Piron, and Fanchi and Collins.\n\nSome researchers view the evolution parameter as a mathematical artifact while others view the parameter as a physically measurable quantity. To understand the role of an evolution parameter and the fundamental difference between the standard theory and evolution parameter theories, it is necessary to review the concept of time. \n\nTime t played the role of a monotonically increasing evolution parameter in classical Newtonian mechanics, as in the force law F = dP/dt for a non-relativistic, classical object with momentum P. To Newton, time was an “arrow” that parameterized the direction of evolution of a system. \n\nEinstein rejected the Newtonian concept and identified t as the fourth coordinate of a space-time four-vector. Einstein's view of time requires a physical equivalence between coordinate time and coordinate space. In this view, time should be a reversible coordinate in the same manner as space. Particles moving backward in time are often used to display antiparticles in Feynman-diagrams, but they are not thought of as really moving backward in time usually it is done to simplify notation. However a lot of people think they are really moving backward in time and take it as evidence for time reversibility.\n\nThe development of non-relativistic quantum mechanics in the early twentieth century preserved the Newtonian concept of time in the Schrödinger equation. The ability of non-relativistic quantum mechanics and special relativity to successfully describe observations motivated efforts to extend quantum concepts to the relativistic domain. Physicists had to decide what role time should play in relativistic quantum theory. The role of time was a key difference between Einsteinian and Newtonian views of classical theory. Two hypotheses that were consistent with special relativity were possible:\n\nAssume t = Einsteinian time and reject Newtonian time.\n\nIntroduce two temporal variables: \n\n\"Hypothesis I\" led to a relativistic probability conservation equation that is essentially a re-statement of the non-relativistic continuity equation. Time in the relativistic probability conservation equation is Einstein’s time and is a consequence of implicitly adopting \"Hypothesis I\". By adopting \"Hypothesis I\", the standard paradigm has at its foundation a temporal paradox: motion relative to a single temporal variable must be reversible even though the second law of thermodynamics establishes an “arrow of time” for evolving systems, including relativistic systems. Thus, even though Einstein’s time is reversible in the standard theory, the evolution of a system is not time reversal invariant. From the perspective of \"Hypothesis I\", time must be both an irreversible arrow tied to entropy and a reversible coordinate in the Einsteinian sense. The development of relativistic dynamics is motivated in part by the concern that \"Hypothesis I\" was too restrictive.\n\nThe problems associated with the standard formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics provide a clue to the validity of \"Hypothesis I\". These problems included negative probabilities, hole theory, the Klein paradox, non-covariant expectation values, and so forth. Most of these problems were never solved; they were avoided when quantum field theory (QFT) was adopted as the standard paradigm. The QFT perspective, particularly its formulation by Schwinger, is a subset of the more general Relativistic Dynamics.\n\nRelativistic Dynamics is based on \"Hypothesis II\" and employs two temporal variables: a coordinate time, and an evolution parameter. The evolution parameter, or parameterized time, may be viewed as a physically measurable quantity, and a procedure has been presented for designing evolution parameter clocks. By recognizing the existence of a distinct parameterized time and a distinct coordinate time, the conflict between a universal direction of time and a time that may proceed as readily from future to past as from past to future is resolved. The distinction between parameterized time and coordinate time removes ambiguities in the properties associated with the two temporal concepts in Relativistic Dynamics.\n\nGoogle scholar for relativistic dynamics sciences.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "186330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186330", "title": "Sumptuary law", "text": "Sumptuary law\n\nSumptuary laws (from Latin \"sumptuāriae lēgēs\") are laws that attempt to regulate consumption; \"Black's Law Dictionary\" defines them as \"Laws made for the purpose of restraining luxury or extravagance, particularly against inordinate expenditures in the matter of apparel, food, furniture, etc.\" Historically, they were laws that were intended to regulate and reinforce social hierarchies and morals through restrictions, often depending upon a person's social rank, on their permitted clothing, food, and luxury expenditures.\n\nSocieties have used sumptuary laws for a variety of purposes. They were used as an attempt to regulate the balance of trade by limiting the market for expensive imported goods. They made it easy to identify social rank and privilege, and as such could be used for social discrimination.\n\nThe laws frequently prevented commoners from imitating the appearance of aristocrats and also could be used to stigmatize disfavored groups. In the Late Middle Ages, sumptuary laws in medieval cities were instituted as a way for the nobility to cap or limit the conspicuous consumption of the prosperous bourgeoisie. If bourgeois subjects appeared to be as wealthy or wealthier than the ruling nobility, it could undermine the nobility's presentation of themselves as powerful, legitimate rulers. This could call into question their ability to control and defend their fief, and inspire potential traitors and rebels. Such laws continued to be used for these purposes well into the 17th century.\n\nThe first written Greek law code (Locrian code), by Zaleucus in the 7th century BC, stipulated that: \nIt also banned the drinking of undiluted wine except for medical purposes.\n\nThe \"Sumptuariae Leges\" of ancient Rome were various laws passed to prevent inordinate expense (Latin \"sūmptus\") in banquets and dress, such as the use of expensive Tyrian purple dye. In the early years of the Empire, men were forbidden to wear silk.\n\nIt was considered the duty of government to put a check upon extravagance in personal expenditure, and such restrictions are found in laws attributed to the kings of Rome and in the Twelve Tables. The Roman censors, who were entrusted with the \"disciplina\" or \"cura morum\", published the \"nota censoria\". In it were listed the names of everyone found guilty of a luxurious mode of living; a great many instances of this kind are recorded. As the Roman Republic wore on, further such laws were passed; however, towards the end of the Republic, they were virtually repealed. Any such laws which may have still existed were ignored during the period of profligate luxury characterizing the height of the Roman Empire, except the laws regarding the wearing of Tyrian purple.\n\nOnly the Roman Emperor could wear the symbol of his office, a Tyrian purple cape trimmed in golden thread, and Roman senators were the only ones who could wear the badge of their office, a Tyrian purple stripe on their toga. During the height of the Empire, expenditure on silk imported from Sinica was so high that Imperial advisers warned that Roman silver reserves were becoming exhausted.\n\nSumptuary laws existed in China in one form or another from the Qin dynasty onwards (221 BC). The Confucian virtue of restraint was embodied in the scholarly system central to China's bureaucracy and became encoded in its laws.\n\nSome laws concerned the size and decoration of graves and mausoleums. The founder of the Ming dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor, issued such regulations in the first year of his rule (1368) and tightened them in 1396, allowing only the highest nobility and officials of the top three ranks a memorial stele installed on top of a stone tortoise; the steles of lower-level mandarins were perched on rectangular pedestals, while commoners had to be satisfied with a simple gravestone. The location of graves, and the number of attendant statues depended on rank.\n\nAfter circa 1550, sumptuary law in China was reformed. It had long been ineffective. The consumption of luxuries had risen over the previous several centuries, and at the time of the European Industrial revolution, Chinese consumption of luxuries such as tea, sugar, fine silk, tobacco and eating utensils was on a par with core regions in Europe.\n\nAccording to \"Britannica Online\", \"In feudal Japan sumptuary laws were passed with a frequency and minuteness of scope that had no parallel in the history of the Western world.\" During the Tokugawa period (1603–1868) in Japan, people of every class were subject to strict sumptuary laws that included regulation of the types of clothing that could be worn. In the second half of that period (the 18th and 19th centuries), the merchant class (\"chōnin\") had grown far wealthier than the aristocratic samurai, and these laws sought to maintain the superiority of the samurai class despite the ability of the merchants to wear far more luxurious clothing and to own far more luxurious items. The shogunate eventually gave in and allowed certain concessions, including allowing merchants of a certain prestige to wear a single sword at their belt; samurai were required to wear a matched pair when on official duty.\n\nIslamic sumptuary laws are based upon teachings found in the Quran and Hadith. Males are exhorted not to wear silk clothes, nor have jewelry made of gold. Likewise, wearing clothes or robes that drag on the ground, seen as a sign of vanity and excessive pride, are also forbidden. These rules do not apply to women, who are allowed all this.\n\nProhibition of depictions of human and animal figures in general are similar to those of the Quranic prohibition on graven images. Hadiths do allow the depiction of animals on clothing items.\n\nSumptuary laws issued by secular authorities aimed at keeping the main population dressed according to their \"station\" do not begin until the later 13th century. These laws were addressed to the entire social body, but the brunt of regulation was directed at women and the middle classes. Their curbing of display was ordinarily couched in religious and moralizing vocabulary, yet was affected by social and economic considerations aimed at preventing ruinous expenses among the wealthy classes and the drain of capital reserves to foreign suppliers.\n\nSpecial forms of dress for prostitutes and courtesans were introduced in the 13th century: in Marseilles a striped cloak, in England a striped hood, and so on. Over time, these tended to be reduced to distinctive bands of fabric attached to the arm or shoulder, or tassels on the arm. Later restrictions specified various forms of finery that were forbidden, although there was also sometimes a recognition that finery represented working equipment (and capital) for a prostitute, and they could be exempted from laws applying to other non-noble women. By the 15th century, no compulsory clothing seems to have been imposed on prostitutes in Florence, Venice (the European capital of courtesans) or Paris.\n\nIn England, which in this respect was typical of Europe, from the reign of Edward III in the Middle Ages until well into the 17th century, sumptuary laws dictated what colour and type of clothing, furs, fabrics, and trims were allowed to persons of various ranks or incomes. In the case of clothing, this was intended, amongst other reasons, to reduce spending on foreign textiles and to ensure that people did not dress \"above their station\":\n\nA 1571 Act of Parliament to stimulate domestic wool consumption and general trade decreed that on Sundays and holidays all males over six years of age, except for the nobility and persons of degree, were to wear woollen caps on pain of a fine of three farthings (¾ penny) per day. This law instituted the flat cap as part of English wear. The 1571 act was repealed in 1597.\n\nAn extremely long list of items, specifying colour, materials, and sometimes place of manufacture (imported goods being much more tightly restricted) followed for each sex, with equally specific exceptions by rank of nobility or position held. For the most part, these laws seem to have had little effect, though the Parliament of England made repeated amendments to the laws, and several monarchs (most notably the Tudors) continually called for stricter enforcement, especially at Court \"to the intent there may be a difference of estates known by their apparel after the commendable custom in times past.\"\n\nDuring the Medieval and Renaissance area in Italy, various towns passed sumptuary laws (\"leggi suntuarie\") often in response to particular events or movements. For example, San Bernardino da Siena, in his public sermons in Siena, thundered against the vanity of luxurious dress; this, however, was counterbalanced by the economic benefit that Siena derived as a manufacturer of items, including clothes, of luxury. One source describes these type of laws as constantly published, and generally ignored. These laws, mostly aimed at female apparel, became sometimes a source of revenue for the state: the Florentine laws of 1415 restricted the luxury that could be worn by women, but exempted those willing to pay 50 florins a year. The laws were often quite specific. Low necklines were prohibited in Genoa, Milan, and Rome in the early 16th century, and laws restricting zibellini (sable furs carried as fashion accessories) with heads and feet of precious metals and jewels were\nissued in Bologna in 1545 and Milan in 1565.\n\nMontaigne's brief essay \"On sumptuary laws\" criticized 16th-century French laws, beginning: \n\nHe also cites Plato and Zaleucus.\n\nIn the early modern period, sumptuary laws continued to be used to support native textile industries in the face of imports. Prohibitions continued to be tied to rank and income and continued to be widely ignored.\n\nIn 1629 and 1633, Louis XIII of France issued edicts regulating \"Superfluity of Dress\" that prohibited anyone but princes and the nobility from wearing gold embroidery or caps, shirts, collars and cuffs embroidered with metallic threads or lace, and puffs, slashes, and bunches of ribbon were severely restricted. As with other such laws, these were widely disregarded and laxly enforced. A series of popular engravings by Abraham Bosse depicts the supposed effects of this law.\n\nIn the Massachusetts Bay Colony, only people with a personal fortune of at least two hundred pounds could wear lace, silver or gold thread or buttons, cutwork, embroidery, hatbands, belts, ruffles, capes, and other articles. After a few decades, the law was being widely defied.\n\nWhile there are rarely restrictions on the type or quality of clothing, beyond maintenance of public decency (covering parts of the body, depending upon the jurisdiction; not exhibiting unacceptable wording or images), it is widely forbidden to wear certain types of clothing restricted to specific occupations, specifically the uniforms of organisations such as police and the military.\n\nIn some jurisdictions clothing or other visible signs of religious or political opinion (e.g. Nazi imagery in Germany) are forbidden in certain public places.\n\nMany American states in the 20th century prohibited the wearing of KKK hoods, masks, masquerade, or drag; gay men in New York City seized on the exemption for masquerade balls in the 1920s to 1930s to go in drag.\n\nSumptuary laws have also been used to control populations by prohibiting the wearing of native dress and hairstyles, along with the proscription of other cultural customs. Sir John Perrot, Lord Deputy of Ireland under Elizabeth I, banned the wearing of traditional woollen mantles, \"open smocks\" with \"great sleeves\", and native headdresses, requiring the people to dress in \"civil garments\" in the English style.\n\nIn a similar manner, the Dress Act of 1746, part of the Act of Proscription issued under King George II of Great Britain following the Jacobite risings, made wearing Scottish Highland dress including tartans and kilts illegal in Scotland for anyone not in the British military. The Act was repealed in 1782, having been largely successful, and a few decades later, \"romantic\" Highland dress was enthusiastically adopted by George IV on a Walter Scott-inspired visit to Scotland in 1822.\n\nIn Bhutan, the wearing of traditional dress (which also has an ethnic connotation) in certain places, such as when visiting government offices, was made compulsory in 1989 under the driglam namzha laws. Part of the traditional dress includes the kabney, a long scarf whose coloring is regulated. Only the King of Bhutan and Chief Abbot may don the saffron scarf, with various other colors reserved for government and religious officers, and white available for common people.\n\nThe term \"sumptuary law\" has been used as a pejorative term to describe any governmental control of consumption, whether based on moral, religious, health, or public safety concerns. American Judge Thomas M. Cooley generally described their modern form as laws that \"substitute the legislative judgment for that of the proprietor, regarding the manner in which he should use and employ his property.\" Policies to which the term has been critically applied include alcohol prohibition, drug prohibition, smoking bans, and restrictions on dog fighting.\n\nAs early as 1860, Anthony Trollope, writing about his experiences in Maine under the state's prohibition law, stated, \"This law (prohibition), like all sumptuary laws, must fail.\" In 1918, William Howard Taft decried prohibition in the United States as a bad sumptuary law, stating that one of his reasons for opposing prohibition was his belief that \"sumptuary laws are matters for parochial adjustment.\" Taft later repeated this concern. The Supreme Court of Indiana also discussed alcohol prohibition as a sumptuary law in its 1855 decision \"Herman v. State\". During state conventions on the ratification of the 21st Amendment in 1933, numerous delegates throughout the United States decried prohibition as having been an improper sumptuary law that never should have been included in the Constitution of the United States.\n\nIn 1971, a United States federal study stated that federal laws on alcohol include \"sumptuary laws which are directed at the purchaser\", including, \"Sales are not permitted to minors or intoxicated persons. Credit is often prohibited on liquor sales as well. Criminal penalties may be imposed for driving under the influence of alcohol as well as for drunken behavior.\"\n\nWhen the U.S. State of Washington considered cannabis decriminalization in two initiatives, 229 and 248, the initiatives' language stated, \"Cannabis prohibition is a sumptuary law of a nature repugnant to our Constitution's framers.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "223389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=223389", "title": "Vedanta", "text": "Vedanta\n\nVedanta (; Sanskrit: वेदान्त, IAST: ') or Uttara Mīmāṃsā\"' is one of the six orthodox (\"āstika\") schools of Hindu philosophy. \"Vedanta\" literally means \"end of the Vedas\", reflecting ideas that emerged from the speculations and philosophies contained in the Upanishads. It does not stand for one comprehensive or unifying doctrine. Rather it is an umbrella term for many sub-traditions, ranging from dualism to non-dualism, all of which developed on the basis of a common textual connection called the \"Prasthanatrayi\". The \"Prasthanatrayi\" is a collective term for the \"Principal Upanishads\", the \"Brahma Sutras\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita.\"\n\nAll Vedanta schools, in their deliberations, concern themselves with the following three categories but differ in their views regarding the concept and the relations between them: \"Brahman\" – the ultimate metaphysical reality, \"Ātman\" / \"Jivātman\" – the individual soul or self, and \"Prakriti\" – the empirical world, ever-changing physical universe, body and matter.\n\nSome of the better known sub-traditions of Vedanta include Advaita (non-dualism), Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism), and Dvaita (dualism). Most other Vedantic sub-traditions are subsumed under the term Bhedabheda (difference and non-difference). Over time, Vedanta adopted ideas from other orthodox (\"āstika\") schools like \"Yoga\" and \"Nyaya\", and, through this syncretism, became the most prominent school of Hinduism. Many extant forms of Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism have been significantly shaped and influenced by the doctrines of different schools of Vedanta. The Vedanta school has had a historic and central influence on Hinduism.\nThe word \"Vedanta\" literally means the \"end of the Vedas\" and originally referred to the \"Upanishads\". Vedanta was concerned with the or Vedic knowledge part called the \"Upanishads\". The denotation of Vedanta subsequently widened to include the various philosophical traditions based on to the \"Prasthanatrayi\".\n\nThe \"Upanishads\" may be regarded as the end of \"Vedas\" in different senses:\n\nVedanta is one of the six orthodox (\"āstika\") schools of Indian philosophy. It is also called \"Uttara Mīmāṃsā\", the 'latter enquiry' or 'higher enquiry'; and is often contrasted with \"Pūrva Mīmāṃsā\", the 'former enquiry' or 'primary enquiry'. \"Pūrva Mīmāṃsā\" deals with the \"karmakāṇḍa\" or rituals part (the \"Samhita\" and \"Brahmanas\") in the \"Vedas\".\n\nThe \"Upanishads\", the \"Bhagavadgita\" and the \"Brahma Sutras\" constitute the basis of Vedanta. All schools of Vedanta propound their philosophy by interpreting these texts, collectively called the \"Prasthanatrayi\", literally, \"three sources\".\n\n\nThe \"Brahma Sutras\" attempted to synthesize the teachings of the \"Upanishads\". The diversity in the teaching of the \"Upanishads\" necessitated the systematization of these teachings. This was likely done in many ways in ancient India, but the only surviving version of this synthesis is the \"Brahma Sutras\" of \"Badarayana\".\n\nAll major Vedantic teachers, including Shankara, Bhaskara, Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Vallabha and Madhva, have composed commentaries not only on the \"Upanishads\" and \"Brahma Sutras\", but also on the \"Bhagavad Gita\". The \"Bhagavad Gita\", due to its syncretism of Samkhya, Yoga, and Upanishadic thought, has played a major role in Vedantic thought.\n\nThe \"Upanishads\" present a rigorous philosophical inquiry in the form of identifying various doctrines and then presenting arguments for or against them. They form the basic texts and Vedanta interprets them through rigorous philosophical exegesis. Varying interpretations of the \"Upanishads\" and their synthesis, the \"Brahma Sutras\", led to the development of different schools of Vedanta over time of which three, four, five or six are prominent.\n\nThe history of Vedanta is divided into two periods: one prior to the composition of the \"Brahma Sutras\" and the other encompassing the schools that developed after the \"Brahma Sutras\" were written.\n\nLittle is known of schools of Vedanta existing before the composition of the \"Brahma Sutras\" (400–450 BCE). It is clear that Badarayana, the writer of \"Brahma Sutras\", was not the first person to systematize the teachings of the \"Upanishads\", as he quotes six Vedantic teachers before him – Ashmarathya, Badari, Audulomi, Kashakrtsna, Karsnajini and Atreya. References to other early Vedanta teachers – Brahmadatta, Sundara, Pandaya, Tanka and Dravidacharya – are found in secondary literature of later periods. The works of these ancient teachers have not survived, but based on the quotes attributed to them in later literature, Sharma postulates that Ashmarathya and Audulomi were Bhedabheda scholars, Kashakrtsna and Brahmadatta were Advaita scholars, while Tanka and Dravidacharya were either Advaita or Vishistadvaita scholars.\n\nBadarayana summarized and interpreted teachings of the \"Upanishads\" in the \"Brahma Sutras\", also called the \"Vedanta Sutra\". Badarayana summarized the teachings of the classical Upanishads and refuted the rival philosophical schools in ancient India. The Brahma Sutras laid the basis for the development of Vedanta philosophy.\n\nThough attributed to Badarayana, the Brahma Sutras were likely composed by multiple authors over the course of hundreds of years. The estimates on when the Brahma Sutras were complete vary, with Nicholson in his 2013 review stating, that they were most likely compiled in the present form around 400–450 BCE. Isaeva suggests they were complete and in current form by 200 CE, while Nakamura states that \"the great part of the \"Sutra\" must have been in existence much earlier than that.\"\n\nThe book is composed of four chapters, each divided into four quarters or sections. These sutras attempt to synthesize the diverse teachings of the Upanishads. However, the cryptic nature of aphorisms of the \"Brahma Sutras\" have required exegetical commentaries. These commentaries have resulted in the formation of numerous Vedanta schools, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own commentary.\n\nLittle with specificity is known of the period between the \"Brahma Sutras\" (5th century BCE) and Adi Shankara (8th century CE). Only two writings of this period have survived: the \"Vākyapadīya\", written by Bhartṛhari (second half 5th century), and the \"Kārikā\" written by Gaudapada (early 6th or 7th century CE).\n\nShankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his school in his commentaries. A number of important early Vedanta thinkers have been listed in the \"Siddhitraya\" by Yamunācārya (c. 1050), the \"Vedārthasamgraha\" by Rāmānuja (c. 1050–1157), and the \"Yatīndramatadīpikā\" by Śrīnivāsa Dāsa. At least fourteen thinkers are known to have existed between the composition of the Brahma Sutras and Shankara's lifetime.\n\nA noted scholar of this period was Bhartriprapancha. Bhartriprapancha maintained that the Brahman is one and there is unity, but that this unity has varieties. Scholars see Bhartriprapancha as an early philosopher in the line who teach the tenet of Bhedabheda.\n\nGaudapada (c. 6th century CE), was the teacher or a more distant predecessor of Govindapada, the teacher of Adi Shankara. Shankara is widely considered as the founder of Advaita Vedanta. Gaudapada's treatise, the '—also known as the ' or the \"\"—is the earliest surviving complete text on Advaita Vedanta.\n\nGaudapada's ' relied on the Mandukya, Brihadaranyaka and Chhandogya \"Upanishads\". In the ', Advaita (non-dualism) is established on rational grounds (\"upapatti\") independent of scriptural revelation; its arguments are devoid of all religious, mystical or scholastic elements. Scholars are divided on a possible influence of Buddhism on Gaudapada's philosophy. The fact that Shankara, in addition to the \"Brahma Sutras\", the principal \"Upanishads\" and the \"Bhagvad Gita\", wrote an independent commentary on the \"\" proves its importance in literature.\n\nAdi Shankara (788–820), elaborated on Gaudapada's work and more ancient scholarship to write detailed commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi and the '. The Mandukya Upanishad and the ' have been described by Shankara as containing \"the epitome of the substance of the import of Vedanta\". It was Shankara who integrated Gaudapada work with the ancient \"Brahma Sutras\", \"and give it a \"locus classicus\"\" alongside the realistic strain of the \"Brahma Sutras\". His interpretation, including works ascribed to him, has become the normative interpretation of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nA noted contemporary of Shankara was Maṇḍana Miśra, who regarded Mimamsa and Vedanta as forming a single system and advocated their combination known as \"Karma-jnana-samuchchaya-vada\". The treatise on the differences between the Vedanta school and the Mimamsa school was a contribution of Adi Shankara. Advaita Vedanta rejects rituals in favor of renunciation, for example.\n\nRāmānuja (1017–1137 CE) was the most influential philosopher in the Vishishtadvaita tradition. As the philosophical architect of Vishishtadvaita, he taught qualified non-dualism. Ramanuja's teacher, Yadava Prakasha, followed the Advaita monastic tradition. Tradition has it that Ramanuja disagreed with Yadava and Advaita Vedanta, and instead followed Nathamuni and Yāmuna. Ramanuja reconciled the \"Prasthanatrayi\" with the theism and philosophy of the Vaishnava Alvars poet-saints. Ramanuja wrote a number of influential texts, such as a bhasya on the \"Brahma Sutras\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita\", all in Sanskrit.\n\nRamanuja presented the epistemological and soteriological importance of bhakti, or the devotion to a personal God (Vishnu in Ramanuja's case) as a means to spiritual liberation. His theories assert that there exists a plurality and distinction between Atman (souls) and Brahman (metaphysical, ultimate reality), while he also affirmed that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the Brahman. Vishishtadvaiata provides the philosophical basis of Sri Vaishnavism.\n\nRamanuja was influential in integrating \"Bhakti\", the devotional worship, into Vedanta premises.\n\nDvaita was propounded by Madhvacharya (1238–1317 CE). He presented the opposite interpretation of Shankara in his Dvaita, or dualistic system. In contrast to Shankara's non-dualism and Ramanuja's qualified non-dualism, he championed unqualified dualism. Madhva wrote commentaries on the chief \"Upanishads\", the \"Bhagavad Gita\" and the \"Brahma Sutra\".\n\nMadhva started his Vedic studies at age seven, joined an Advaita Vedanta monastery in Dwarka (Gujarat), studied under guru Achyutrapreksha, frequently disagreed with him, left the Advaita monastery, and founded Dvaita. Madhva and his followers Jayatirtha and Vyasatirtha, were critical of all competing Hindu philosophies, Jainism and Buddhism, but particularly intense in their criticism of Advaita Vedanta and Adi Shankara.\n\nDvaita Vedanta is theistic and it identifies Brahman with Narayana, or more specifically Vishnu, in a manner similar to Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. But it is more explicitly pluralistic. Madhva's emphasis for difference between soul and Brahman was so pronounced that he taught there were differences (1) between material things; (2) between material things and souls; (3) between material things and God; (4) between souls; and (5) between souls and God. He also advocated for a difference in degrees in the possession of knowledge. He also advocated for differences in the enjoyment of bliss even in the case of liberated souls, a doctrine found in no other system of Indian philosophy. \n\nAdvaita Vedanta (IAST \"\"; Sanskrit: अद्वैत वेदान्त) espouses non-dualism and monism. \"Brahman\" is held to be the sole unchanging metaphysical reality and identical to \"Atman\". The physical world, on the other hand, is always-changing empirical \"Maya\". The absolute and infinite \"Atman\"-\"Brahman\" is realized by a process of negating everything relative, finite, empirical and changing. The school accepts no duality, no limited individual souls (\"Atman\" / \"Jivatman\"), and no separate unlimited cosmic soul. All souls and existence across space and time is considered as the same oneness (i.e. monism). Spiritual liberation in \"Advaita\" is the full comprehension and realization of oneness, that one's unchanging \"Atman\" (soul) is the same as the \"Atman\" in everyone else, as well as being identical to the \"nirguna\" \"Brahman\".\n\n\"Vishishtadvaita\" asserts that \"Jivatman\" (human souls) and \"Brahman\" (as \"Vishnu\") are different, a difference that is never transcended. With this qualification, Ramanuja also affirmed monism by saying that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the \"Brahman\". \"Vishishtadvaita\", like \"Advaita\", is a non-dualistic school of Vedanta in a qualified way, and both begin by assuming that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation. On the relation between the \"Brahman\" and the world of matter (\"Prakriti\"), \"Vishishtadvaita\" states both are two different absolutes, both metaphysically true and real, neither is false or illusive, and that \"saguna\" \"Brahman\" with attributes is also real. Ramanuja states that God, like man, has both soul and body, and the world of matter is the glory of God's body. The path to \"Brahman\" (\"Vishnu\"), according to Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of the personal god (\"bhakti\" of \"saguna\" \"Brahman\").\n\n\"Shuddhadvaita\" (pure non-dualism) states that the entire universe is real and is subtly \"Brahman\" only in the form of \"Krishna\". Vallabhacharya, the propounder of this philosophy, agreed with Advaita Vedanta's ontology, but emphasized that \"prakriti\" (empirical world, body) is not separate from the \"Brahman\", but just another manifestation of the latter. Everything, everyone, everywhere—soul and body, living and non-living, \"jiva\" and matter—is the eternal \"Krishna\". The way to \"Krishna\", in this school, is \"bhakti\". Vallabha opposed renunciation of monistic \"sannyasa\" as ineffective and advocates the path of devotion (\"bhakti\") rather than knowledge (\"jnana\"). The goal of \"bhakti\" is to turn away from ego, self-centered-ness and deception, and to turn towards the eternal \"Krishna\" in everything continually offering freedom from \"samsara\".\n\nThis school is based on the premise of dualism. \"Atman\" (soul) and \"Brahman\" (as \"Vishnu\") are understood as two completely different entities. \"Brahman\" is the creator of the universe, perfect in knowledge, perfect in knowing, perfect in its power, and distinct from souls, distinct from matter. In \"Dvaita\" Vedanta, an individual soul must feel attraction, love, attachment and complete devotional surrender to \"Vishnu\" for salvation, and it is only His grace that leads to redemption and salvation. Madhva believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned, a view not found in \"Advaita\" and \"Vishishtadvaita\" Vedanta. While the \"Vishishtadvaita\" Vedanta asserted \"qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism of souls\", Madhva asserted both \"qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls\".\n\n\"Bhedābheda\" means \"difference and non–difference\" and is more a tradition than a school of Vedanta. The schools of this tradition emphasize that the individual self (\"Jīvatman\") is both different and not different from \"Brahman\". Notable figures in this school are Bhartriprapancha, Bhāskara (8th–9th century), Ramanuja's teacher Yādavaprakāśa, Nimbārka (13th century) who founded the Dvaitadvaita school, Caitanya (1486–1534) who founded the Achintya Bheda Abheda school and Vijñānabhikṣu (16th century). \n\nBhaskara, in postulating \"Upadhika\", considers both identity and difference to be equally real. As the causal principle, \"Brahman\" is considered non-dual and formless pure being and intelligence. The same \"Brahman\", manifest as events, becomes the world of plurality. \"\" is \"Brahman\" limited by the mind. Matter and its limitations are considered real, not a manifestation of ignorance. Bhaskara advocated \"bhakti\" as \"dhyana\" (meditation) directed toward the transcendental \"Brahman\". He refuted the idea of \"Maya\" and denied the possibility of liberation in bodily existence.\n\nNimbārka propounded \"Dvaitādvaita\", based upon Bhedābheda as was taught by Bhāskara. \"Brahman\" (God), souls \"(chit)\" and matter or the universe \"(achit)\" are considered as three equally real and co-eternal realities. \"Brahman\" is the controller \"(niyantr)\", the soul is the enjoyer \"(bhoktr)\", and the material universe is the object enjoyed \"(bhogya)\". The Brahman is \"Krishna\", the ultimate cause who is omniscient, omnipotent, all-pervading Being. He is the efficient cause of the universe because, as Lord of \"Karma\" and internal ruler of souls, He brings about creation so that the souls can reap the consequences of their \"karma\". God is considered to be the material cause of the universe because creation was a manifestation of His powers of soul \"(chit)\" and matter \"(achit)\"; creation is a transformation \"(parinama)\" of God's powers. He can be realized only through a constant effort to merge oneself with His nature through meditation and devotion. \n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu was the prime exponent of \"Achintya-Bheda-Abheda\". In Sanskrit \"achintya\" means 'inconceivable'. \"Achintya-Bheda-Abheda\" represents the philosophy of \"inconceivable difference in non-difference\", in relation to the non-dual reality of \"Brahman\"-\"Atman\" which it calls (\"Krishna\"), \"svayam bhagavan\". The notion of \"inconceivability\" (\"acintyatva\") is used to reconcile apparently contradictory notions in Upanishadic teachings. This school asserts that \"Krishna\" is \"Bhagavan\" of the \"bhakti yogins\", the \"Brahman\" of the \"jnana yogins\", and has a divine potency that is inconceivable. He is all-pervading and thus in all parts of the universe (non-difference), yet he is inconceivably more (difference). This school is at the foundation of the \"Gaudiya Vaishnava\" religious tradition.\n\nThe important approaches followed by the most noted proponents of different schools of Vedanta are summarized below:\n\nSivananda gives the following explanation:\nDespite their differences, all schools of Vedanta share some common features:\n\nVedanta philosophies discuss three fundamental metaphysical categories and the relations between the three.\n\nShankara, in formulating Advaita, talks of two conceptions of \"Brahman\": the higher \"Brahman\" as undifferentiated Being, and a lower \"Brahman\" endowed with qualities as the creator of the universe.\n\nRamanuja, in formulating Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, rejects \"nirguṇa\"—that the undifferentiated Absolute is inconceivable—and adopts a theistic interpretation of the \"Upanishads\", accepts \"Brahman\" as \"Ishvara\", the personal God who is the seat of all auspicious attributes, as the One reality. The God of Vishishtadvaita is accessible to the devotee, yet remains the Absolute, with differentiated attributes.\n\nMadhva, in expounding Dvaita philosophy, maintains that \"Vishnu\" is the supreme God, thus identifying the \"Brahman\", or absolute reality, of the \"Upanishads\" with a personal god, as Ramanuja had done before him. Nimbarka, in his dvaitadvata philosophy, accepted the \"Brahman\" both as \"nirguṇa\" and as \"saguṇa\". Vallabha, in his shuddhadvaita philosophy, not only accepts the triple ontological essence of the \"Brahman\", but also His manifestation as personal God (\"Ishvara\"), as matter and as individual souls.\n\nThe schools of Vedanta differ in their conception of the relation they see between \"Ātman\" / \"Jivātman\" and \"Brahman\" / \"Ishvara\":\n\n\"Pramāṇa\" (Sanskrit: प्रमाण) literally means \"proof\", \"that which is the means of valid knowledge\". It refers to epistemology in Indian philosophies, and encompasses the study of reliable and valid means by which human beings gain accurate, true knowledge. The focus of Pramana is the manner in which correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows or does not know, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired. Ancient and medieval Indian texts identify six \"pramanas\" as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths:\nThe different schools of Vedanta have historically disagreed as to which of the six are epistemologically valid. For example, while Advaita Vedanta accepts all six \"pramanas\", Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita accept only three \"pramanas\" (perception, inference and testimony).\n\nAdvaita considers \"Pratyakṣa\" (perception) as the most reliable source of knowledge, and \"Śabda\", the scriptural evidence, is considered secondary except for matters related to Brahman, where it is the only evidence. In Vishistadvaita and Dvaita, \"Śabda\", the scriptural testimony, is considered the most authentic means of knowledge instead.\n\nAll schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of \"Satkāryavāda\", which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are two different views on the status of the \"effect\", that is, the world. Most schools of Vedanta, as well as Samkhya, support \"Parinamavada\", the idea that the world is a real transformation (\"parinama\") of Brahman. According to , \"the \"Brahma Sutras\" espouse the realist Parinamavada position, which appears to have been the view most common among early Vedantins\". In contrast to Badarayana, Adi Shankara and Advaita Vedantists hold a different view, \"Vivartavada\", which says that the effect, the world, is merely an unreal (\"vivarta\") transformation of its cause, Brahman.\n\nVedanta, adopting ideas from other orthodox (\"āstika\") schools, became the most prominent school of Hinduism. Vedanta traditions led to the development of many traditions in Hinduism. Sri Vaishnavism of south and southeastern India is based on Ramanuja's \"Vishishtadvaita\" Vedanta. Ramananda led to the \"Vaishnav Bhakti\" Movement in north, east, central and west India. This movement draws its philosophical and theistic basis from \"Vishishtadvaita\". A large number of devotional \"Vaishnavism\" traditions of east India, north India (particularly the Braj region), west and central India are based on various sub-schools of \"Bhedabheda\" Vedanta. \"Advaita\" Vedanta influenced \"Krishna Vaishnavism\" in the northeastern state of Assam. The Madhva school of Vaishnavism found in coastal Karnataka is based on \"Dvaita\" Vedanta.\n\n\"Āgamas\", the classical literature of \"Shaivism\", though independent in origin, show Vedanta association and premises. Of the 92 \"Āgamas\", ten are (\"dvaita\") texts, eighteen (\"bhedabheda\"), and sixty-four (\"advaita\") texts. While the \"Bhairava Shastras\" are monistic, \"Shiva Shastras\" are dualistic. finds the link between Gaudapada's \"Advaita\" Vedanta and \"Kashmir Shaivism\" evident and natural. Tirumular, the Tamil \"Shaiva Siddhanta\" scholar, credited with creating \"Vedanta–Siddhanta\" (Advaita Vedanta and Shaiva Siddhanta synthesis), stated, \"becoming \"Shiva\" is the goal of Vedanta and \"Siddhanta\"; all other goals are secondary to it and are vain.\"\n\n\"Shaktism\", or traditions where a goddess is considered identical to \"Brahman\", has similarly flowered from a syncretism of the monist premises of \"Advaita\" Vedanta and dualism premises of \"Samkhya–Yoga\" school of Hindu philosophy, sometimes referred to as \"Shaktadavaitavada\" (literally, the path of nondualistic \"Shakti\").\n\nNeo-Vedanta, variously called as \"Hindu modernism\", \"neo-Hinduism\", and \"neo-Advaita\", is a term that denotes some novel interpretations of Hinduism that developed in the 19th century, presumably as a reaction to the colonial British rule. writes that these notions accorded the Hindu nationalists an opportunity to attempt the construction of a nationalist ideology to help unite the Hindus to fight colonial oppression. Western orientalists, in their search for its \"essence\", attempted to formulate a notion of \"Hinduism\" based on a single interpretation of Vedanta as a unified body of religious praxis. This was contra-factual as, historically, Hinduism and Vedanta had always accepted a diversity of traditions. asserts that the neo-Vedantic theory of \"overarching tolerance and acceptance\" was used by the Hindu reformers, together with the ideas of Universalism and Perennialism, to challenge the polemic dogmatism of Judaeo-Christian-Islamic missionaries against the Hindus.\n\nThe neo-Vedantins argued that the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy were perspectives on a single truth, all valid and complementary to each other. sees these interpretations as incorporating western ideas into traditional systems, especially Advaita Vedanta. It is the modern form of Advaita Vedanta, states , the neo-Vedantists subsumed the Buddhist philosophies as part of the Vedanta tradition and then argued that all the world religions are same \"non-dualistic position as the philosophia perennis\", ignoring the differences within and outside of Hinduism. According to , neo-Vedanta is Advaita Vedanta which accepts universal realism:\n\nA major proponent in the popularization of this Universalist and Perennialist interpretation of Advaita Vedanta was Vivekananda, who played a major role in the revival of Hinduism. He was also instrumental in the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the West via the Vedanta Society, the international arm of the Ramakrishna Order.\n\n writes that the attempts at integration which came to be known as neo-Vedanta were evident as early as between the 12th and the 16th century− Matilal criticizes Neo-Hinduism as an oddity developed by West-inspired Western Indologists and attributes it to the flawed Western perception of Hinduism in modern India. In his scathing criticism of this school of reasoning, says:\n\nAn exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia since the late 18th century as a result of colonization of parts of Asia by Western powers. This also influenced western religiosity. The first translation of \"Upanishads\", published in two parts in 1801 and 1802, significantly influenced Arthur Schopenhauer, who called them the consolation of his life. He drew explicit parallels between his philosophy, as set out in \"The World as Will and Representation\", and that of the Vedanta philosophy as described in the work of Sir William Jones. Early translations also appeared in other European languages. Influenced by Śaṅkara's concepts of \"Brahman\" (God) and \"māyā\" (illusion), Lucian Blaga often used the concepts \"marele anonim\" (the Great Anonymous) and \"cenzura transcendentă\" (the transcendental censorship) in his philosophy.\n\nAccording to , the Vedanta school has had a historic and central influence on Hinduism:\nFrithjof Schuon summarizes the influence of Vedanta on Hinduism as follows:\nGerman Sanskritist Theodore Goldstücker was among the early scholars to notice similarities between the religious conceptions of the Vedanta and those of the Dutch Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza, writing that Spinoza's thought was\n\nMax Müller noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying,\n\nHelena Blavatsky, a founder of the Theosophical Society, also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay,\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1358764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1358764", "title": "Women's liberation movement", "text": "Women's liberation movement\n\nThe women's liberation movement (WLM) was a political alignment of women and feminist intellectualism that emerged in the late 1960s and continued into the 1980s primarily in the industrialized nations of the Western world, which effected great change (political, intellectual, cultural) throughout the world. The WLM branch of Radical feminism, based in contemporary philosophy, comprised women of racially- and culturally-diverse backgrounds who proposed that economic, psychological, and social freedom were necessary for women to progress from being second-class citizens in their societies.\n\nTowards achieving the equality of women, the WLM questioned the cultural and legal validity of patriarchy and the practical validity of the social and sexual hierarchies used to control and limit the legal and physical independence of women in society. Women's liberationists proposed that sexism — legalised formal and informal sex-based discrimination predicated on the existence of the social construction of gender — was the principal political problem with the power dynamics of their societies. In general, the WLM proposed socio-economic change from the political Left, rejected the idea that piece-meal equality, within and according to social class, would eliminate sexual discrimination against women, and fostered the tenets of humanism, especially the respect for human rights of all people. In the decades during which the Women's Liberation Movement flourished, liberationists successfully changed how women were perceived in their cultures, redefined the socio-economic and the political roles of women in society, and transformed mainstream society.\nThe wave theory of social development holds that intense periods of social activity are followed by periods of remission, in which the activists involved intensely in mobilization are systematically marginalized and isolated. After the intense period fighting for women's suffrage, the common interest which had united international feminists left the women's movement without a single focus upon which all could agree. Ideological differences between radicals and moderates, led to a split and a period of deradicalization, with the largest group of women's activists spearheading movements to educate women on their new responsibilities as voters. Organizations like the African National Congress Women's League, the Irish Housewives Association, the League of Women Voters, the Townswomen's Guilds and the Women's Institutes supported women and tried to educate them on how to use their new rights to incorporate themselves into the established political system. Still other organizations, involved in the mass movement of women into the work force during World War I and World War II and their subsequent exit at the end of the war with concerted official efforts to return to family life, turned their efforts to labor issues. The World YWCA and Zonta International, were leaders in these efforts, mobilizing women to gather information on the situation of working women and organize assistance programs. Increasingly, radical organizations, like the American National Women's Party, were marginalized, by media which denounced feminism and its proponents as \"severe neurotics responsible for the problems of\" society. Those who were still attached to the radical themes of equality were typically unmarried, employed, socially and economically advantaged and seemed to the larger society to be deviant.\n\nIn countries throughout Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South America efforts to decolonize and replace authoritarian regimes, which largely began in the 1950s and stretched through the 1980s, initially saw the state overtaking the role of radical feminists. For example, in Egypt, the 1956 Constitution eliminated gender barriers to labour, political access, and education through provisions for gender equality. Women in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Nicaragua and other Latin American countries had worked for an end to dictatorships in their countries. As those governments turned to socialist policies, the state aimed to eliminate gender inequality through state action. As ideology in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean shifted left, women in newly independent and still colonized countries saw a common goal in fighting imperialism. They focused their efforts to address gendered power imbalances in their quest for respect of human rights and nationalist goals. This worldwide movement towards decolonization and the realignment of international politics into Cold War camps after the end of World War II, usurped the drive for women's enfranchisement, as universal suffrage and nationhood became the goal for activists. A Pan-African awareness and global recognition of blackness as a unifying point for struggle, led to a recognition by numerous marginalized groups that there was potential to politicize their oppression.\n\nIn their attempt to influence these newly independent countries to align with the United States, in the polarized Cold War climate, racism in U.S. policy became a stumbling block to the foreign policy objective to become the dominant superpower. Black leaders were aware of the favorable climate for securing change and pushed forward the Civil Rights Movement to address racial inequalities. They sought to eliminate the damage of oppression, using liberation theory and a movement which sought to create societal transformation in the way people thought about others by infusing the disenfranchised with political power to change the power structures. The Black Power movement and global student movements protested the apparent double standards of the age and the authoritarian nature of social institutions. From Czechoslovakia to Mexico, in diverse locations like Germany, France, Italy, and Japan, among others, students protested the civil, economic and political inequalities, as well as involvement in the Vietnam War. Many of the activists participating in these causes would go on to participate in the feminist movement.\n\nSocially, the baby boom experienced after World War II, the relative worldwide economic growth in the post-war years, the expansion of the television industry sparking improved communications, as well as access to higher education for both women and men led to an awareness of the social problems women faced and the need for a cultural change. At the time, women were economically dependent on men and neither the concept of patriarchy nor a coherent theory about the power relationships between men and women in society existed. If they worked, positions available to women were typically in light manufacturing or agricultural work and a limited segment of positions in the service industries, such as bookkeeping, domestic labor, nursing, secretarial and clerical work, retail sales, or school teaching. They were expected to work for lower wages than men and upon marriage, terminate their employment. Women were unable to obtain bank accounts or credit, making renting housing impossible, without a man's consent. In many countries they were not allowed to go into public spaces without a male chaperone.\n\nMarried women from countries founded the British colonial system and thus with a legal code based on English law were legally bound to have sex with their husbands upon demand. Marital rape was not a concept, as under law women had given consent to regular intercourse upon marrying. The state and church, placed enormous pressure on young women to retain their virginity. Introduction of the pill, gave many men a sense that as women could not get pregnant, they could not say no to intercourse. Though by the 1960s the pill was widely available, prescription was tightly controlled and in many countries, dissemination of information about birth control was illegal. Even after the pill was legalized, contraception remained banned in numerous countries, like Ireland where condoms were banned and the pill could only be prescribed to control menstrual cycles. The Catholic Church issued the encyclical \"Humanae vitae\" in 1968, reiterating the ban on artificial contraception. Abortion often required the consent of a spouse, or approval by a board, like in Canada, wherein the decisions often revolved around whether pregnancy posed a threat to the woman's health or life.\n\nAs women became more educated and joined the work force, their home responsibilities remained largely unchanged. Though families increasingly depended on dual incomes, women carried most of the responsibility for domestic work and care of children. There had long been recognition by society in general of the inequalities in civil, socio-economic, and political agency between women and men. However, the Women's Liberation Movement was the first time that the idea of challenging sexism gained wide acceptance. Literature on sex, such as the Kinsey Reports, and the development and distribution of the birth control pill, created a climate wherein women began to question the authority others wielded over their decisions regarding their bodies and their morality. Many of the women who participated in the movement, were aligned with leftist politics and after 1960, with the development of Cold War polarization, took their inspiration from Maoist theory. Slogans such as \"workers of the world unite\" turned into \"women of the world unite\" and key features like consciousness-raising and egalitarian consensus-based policies \"were inspired by similar techniques used in China\".\n\nInto this backdrop of world events, Simone de Beauvoir published \"The Second Sex\" in 1949, which was translated into English in 1952. In the book, de Beauvoir put forward the idea that equality did not require women be masculine to become empowered. With her famous statement, \"One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman\", she laid the groundwork for the concept of gender as a social construct, as opposed to a biological trait. The same year, Margaret Mead published \"Male and Female\", which though it analyzed primitive societies of New Guinea, showed that gendered activities varied between cultures and that biology had no role in defining which tasks were performed by men or women. By 1965, de Beauvoir and Mead's works had been translated into Danish and became widely influential with feminists. Kurahashi Yumiko published her debut \"Partei\" in 1960, which critically examined the student movement. The work started a trend in Japan of feminist works which challenged the opportunities available to women and mocked conventional power dynamics in Japanese society. In 1963, Betty Friedan published \"The Feminine Mystique\", voicing the discontent felt by American women.\n\nAs the Women's Suffrage movement emerged from the Abolition Movement, the Women's Liberation Movement grew out of the struggle for civil rights. Though challenging patriarchy and the anti-patriarchal message of the Women's Liberation Movement was considered radical, it was not the only, nor the first, radical movement in the early period of second-wave feminism. Rather than simply desiring legal equality, those participating in the movement believed that the moral and social climate which perceived women as second-class citizens needed to change. Though most groups operated independently—there were no national umbrella organizations—there were unifying philosophies of women participating in the movement. Challenging patriarchy and the hierarchical organization of society which defined women as subordinate in both public and private spheres, liberationists believed that women should be free to define their own individual identity as part of human society.\n\nOne of the reasons that women who supported the movement chose not to create a single approach to addressing the problem of women being treated as second-class citizens was that they did not want to foster an idea that anyone was an expert or that any one group or idea could address all of the societal problems women faced. They also wanted women, whose voices had been silenced to be able to express their own views on solutions. Rejecting authority and espousing participatory democracy as well as direct action, they promoted a wide agenda including civil rights, eliminating objectification of women, ethnic empowerment, granting women reproductive rights, increasing opportunities for women in the workplace, peace, and redefining familial roles, as well as gay and lesbian liberation. A dilemma faced by movement members was how they could challenge the definition of femininity without compromising the principals of feminism.\n\nWomen's historical participation in the world was virtually unknown, even to trained historians. Women's roles in historic events were not covered in academic texts and not taught in schools. Even the fact that women had been denied the vote was something few university students were aware of in the era. To understand the wider implications of women's experiences, WLM groups launched women's studies programs introducing feminist history, sociology and psychology to higher education and adult education curricula to counter gender biases in teaching these subjects. Writing women back into history became extremely important in the period with attention to the differences of experiences based on class, ethnic background, race and sexual orientation. The courses became widespread by the end of the decade in Britain, Canada and the United States, and were also introduced in such places as Italy and Norway.\n\nThousands of adherents joined the movement which began in the United States and spread to Canada and Mexico. In Europe, movements developed in Austria Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales. The liberationist movement also was active in Australia, Fiji, Guam, India, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan.\n\nKey components of the movement were consciousness-raising sessions aimed at politicizing personal issues, small group and limited organizational structure and a focus on changing societal perception rather than reforming legislation. For example, liberationists did not support reforming family codes to allow abortion, instead, they believed that neither medical professionals nor the state should have the power to limit women's complete control of their own bodies. They favored abolishing laws which limited women's rights over their reproduction, believing such control was an individual right, not subject to moralistic majority views. Most liberationists banned the participation of men in their organizations. Though often depicted in media as a sign of \"man-hating\", separation was a focused attempt to eliminate defining women via their relationship to men. Since women's inequality within their employment, family and society were commonly experienced by all women, separation meant unity of purpose to evaluate their second-class status.\n\nIn Canada and the United States, the movement developed out of the Civil Rights Movement, Anti-War sentiment toward the Vietnam War, the Native Rights Movement and the New Left student movement of the 1960s. Between 1965 and 1966, papers presented at meetings of the Students for a Democratic Society and articles published in journals, such as the Canadian \"Random\" began advocating for women to embark on a path of self-discovery free from male scrutiny. In 1967, the first Women's Liberation organizations formed in major cities like Berkeley, Boston, Chicago, New York City and Toronto. Quickly organizations spread across both countries. In Mexico, the first group of liberationists formed in 1970, inspired by the student movement and US women's liberationists.\n\nOrganizations were loosely organized, without a hierarchical power structure and favored all-women participation to eliminate defining women or their autonomy by their association with men. Groups featured consciousness raising discussions on a wide variety of issues, the importance of having freedom to make choices, and the importance of changing societal attitudes and perceptions of women's roles. Canadian Women's Lib groups typically incorporated a class-based component into their theory of oppression which was mostly missing from U.S. liberation theory, which focused almost exclusively on sexism and a belief that women's oppression stemmed from their gender and not as a result of their economic or social class. In Quebec, women's and Quebec's autonomy were entwined issues with women struggling for the right to serve as jurors.\n\nAdvocating public self-expression by participating in protests and sit-ins, liberationists demonstrated against discriminatory hiring and wage practices in Canada, while in the US liberationists protested the Miss America Beauty Pageant for objectifying women. In both countries Women's Liberation groups were involved protesting their legislators for abortion rights for women. In Mexico liberationists protested at the Monument to the Mother on Mother's Day to challenge the idea that all women were destined to be mothers. Challenging gender definitions and the sexual relationship to power drew lesbians into the movement in both the United States and Canada. Because liberationists believed that sisterhood was a uniting component to women's oppression, lesbians were not seen as a threat to other women. Another important aspect for North American women was developing spaces for women to meet with other women, offer counseling and referral services, provide access to feminist materials, and establish women's shelters for women who were in abusive relationships.\n\nIncreasingly mainstream media portrayed liberationists as man-haters or deranged outcasts. To gain legitimacy for the recognition of sexual discrimination, the media discourse on women's issues was increasingly shaped by the liberal feminist's reformist aims. As liberationists were marginalized, they increasingly became involved in single focus issues, such as violence against women. By the mid-1970s, the Women's Liberation Movement had been effective in changing the worldwide perception of women, bringing sexism to light and moving reformists far to the left in their policy aims for women, but in the haste to distance themselves from the more radical elements, liberal feminists attempted to erase their success and rebrand the movement as the Women's Movement.\n\nIn Europe, the women's liberation movement started in the late 1960s and continued through the 1980s. Inspired by events in North America and triggered by the growing presence of women in the labour market, the movement soon gained momentum in Britain and the Scandinavian countries. Though influenced by leftist politics, liberationists in general were resistant to any political order which ignored women entirely or relegated their issues to the sidelines. Women's liberation groups in Europe were distinguished from other feminist activists by their focus on women's rights to control their own bodies and sexuality, as well as their direct actions aimed at provoking the public and making society aware of the issues faced by women.\n\nThere were robust Women's Liberation movements in Western European countries, including developments in Greece, Portugal and Spain, which in the period were emerging from dictatorships. Many different types of actions were held throughout Europe. To increase public awareness of the problems of equal pay, liberationists in Denmark staged a bus sit in, where they demanded lower fares than male passengers to demonstrate their wage gap. Swedish members of \"Grupp 8\" heckled politicians at campaign rallies, demanding to know why women were only allowed part-time jobs and thus were ineligible for pensions. To address the objectification of women, Belgian liberationists protested at beauty pageants, \"Dolle Minas\" in the Netherlands and \"Nyfeministene\" of Norway invaded male-only bars, Irish Women United demonstrated against male-only bathing at Forty Foot promontory and Portuguese women dressed as a bride, a housewife and a sex symbol, marching in Eduardo VII Park.\n\nWomen in England, Scotland and Wales led Reclaim the Night marches to challenge the notion that women's behavior caused the violence perpetrated against them. Spanish liberationists from the \"Colectivo Feminista Pelvis\" (Pelvis Feminist Collective), \"Grup per l'Alliberament de la Dona\" (Group for Women's Liberation) and \"Mujeres Independientes\" (Independent Women) carried funeral wreaths through the streets of Mallorca calling for an end to sexual abuse and a judicial system which allowed men to use alcohol or passion as mitigating factors for sexual violence. In Iceland, women virtually shut down the country; when spurred by liberationists, 90% of them took \"Women's Day Off\" and refused to participate in household duties or work, instead attending a protest rally.\n\nIn almost all Western European countries liberationists fought for elimination of barriers to free and unrestricted access to contraception and abortion. In Austria, to advocate for abolition of section 144 of their criminal code, activists used street theater performance. Prominent French activists declared their criminal actions signing the Manifesto of the 343, admitting to having had abortions, as did German activists who signed the \"Manifesto of the 374\". Irish activists took the train and crossed into Northern Ireland to secure prohibited contraception devices and upon their return flouted authorities by passing the contraband to the public. In the UK, an uneasy alliance formed between liberationists, the National Abortion Campaign and trade unionists to fight a series of bills designed to restrict abortion rights. In Italy, 50,000 women marched through the streets of Rome demanding their right to control their own bodies, but as was typically the result throughout Europe, compromise reform to existing law was passed by the government, limiting the decision by gestation or requiring preliminary medical authorization.\n\nThroughout the period, publishing was crucial for disseminating the theory and ideas of liberation and other feminist schools of thought. Initially many activists relied on translations of material from the US, but increasingly the focus was on producing country-specific editions, or local journals to allow activists to adapt the movement slogan the \"personal is political\" to reflect their own experiences. Journals and newspapers founded by liberationists included Belgium's \"Le Petit livre rouge des femmes\" (The Little Red Book of Women), France's \"\" (Waging the Battle), Greece's \"Gia tin Apeleftherosi ton Gynaikon\" (For the Liberation of Women), Italy's \"Sottosopra\" (Upside Down), the Scottish \"The Tayside Women's Liberation Newsletter\" or the British \"Spare Rib\", among many others. In the UK, a news service called the Women's Information and Referral Service (WIRES) distributed news of WLM groups throughout the nation.\n\nBooks like \"Die Klosterschule\" (The Convent School, 1968) by Barbara Frischmuth, which evaluated patriarchy in the parochial schools of Austria and \"The Descent of Woman\" (1972) by Welsh author and feminist Elaine Morgan, brought women into the movement who thought that their lives differed from those of women in large urban settings where the movement originated. Other influential publications included the British edition of \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\" (1971) edited by Angela Phillips and Jill Rakusen; \"Frauenhandbuch Nr. 1: Abtreibung und Verhütungsmittel\" (Women's Guide # 1: Abortion and Contraceptives, 1971) produced in Germany by Helke Sander and Verena Stefan and \"Skylla sig själv\" (Self-blame, 1976) by Swede Maria-Pia Boëthius, which evaluated rape culture applied analysis and solutions to local areas. In some cases, books themselves became the focus of liberationists' protests over censorship, as in the case of the Norwegian demonstration at the publishing house Aschehoug, which was forced to publish a translation of the Swedish text \"\" (Freedom, Equality and Sisterhood, 1970), or the international outcry which resulted from the ban and arrest of Portuguese authors Maria Teresa Horta, Maria Isabel Barreno and Maria Velho da Costa over their book \"Novas Cartas Portuguesas\" (New Portuguese Letters, 1972).\n\nAs the idea of women's autonomy gained mainstream approval, governments and more reformist minded women's groups adopted liberationists' ideas and began incorporating them into compromise solutions. By the early 1980s, most activists in the Women's Liberation Movements in Europe moved on to other single focus causes or transitioned into organizations which were political.\n\nSpreading from the United States and Britain, the Women's Liberation Movement reached Oceania in 1969. The first organizations were formed in Sydney in 1969, and by 1970 had reached Adelaide and Melbourne, as well as Wellington and Auckland. The following year, organizations were formed at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji and in Guam. As in the US and other places where the movement flourished, small consciousness-raising groups with a limited organizational structure were the norm and the focus was on changing societal perception rather than legislation.\n\nInvolved in public protests, liberationists demonstrated at beauty pageants to protest women's objectification, and invaded male-only pubs. In Australia they ran petition drives and protests in favor of legalizing abortion and in Auckland led a funeral procession through Albert Park to demonstrate lack of progress on issues which were of concern to women. Liberationists developed multiple publications such as \"Broadsheet\", \"Liberaction\", \"MeJane\", \"The Circle\" and \"Women's Liberation Newsletter\" to address issues and concerns;. They founded women's shelters and women's centers for meetings and child care services, which were open to all women, be they socialists, lesbians, indigenous women, students, workers or homemakers. The diversity of adherents fractured the movement by the early 1980s, as groups began focusing on specific interests rather than solely on sexism.\n\nBy the 1970s, the movement had spread to Asia with Women's Liberation organizations forming in Japan in 1970. The Yom Kippur War raised awareness of the subordinate status of Israeli women, fostering the growth of the WLM. In India, 1974 was a pivotal year when activists from the Navnirman Movement against corruption and the economic crisis, encouraged women to organize direct actions to challenge traditional leadership. In 1975, liberationist ideas in South Korea were introduced by Yi Hyo-jae a professor at Ewha Womans University, after she had read western texts on the movement which were first translated into Korean in 1973. Similarly, Hsiu-lien Annette Lu, who had completed her graduate courses in the United States, brought liberationist ideas to Taiwan, when she returned and began publishing in the mid-1970s.\n\nIn Singapore and other Asian countries, conscious effort was made to distinguish their movement from decadent, \"free sex\" Western feminist ideals, while simultaneously addressing issues that were experienced worldwide by women. In India, the struggle for women's autonomy was rarely separated from the struggle against the caste system and in Israel, though their movement more closely resembled the WLM in the US and Europe, the oppression of Palestinian women was a focal area. In Japan, the movement focused on freeing women from societal perceptions of limitations because of their sex, rather than on a stand for equality. In South Korea, women workers' concerns merged with liberationist ideas within the broader fight against dictatorship, whereas in Taiwan, theories of respect for women and eliminating double-standards were promoted by weaving in Confucianist philosophy.\n\nThe FBI kept records on numerous participants in the WLM, both spying on them and infiltrating their organizations. Roberta Sapler, a participant in the movement between 1968 and 1973 in Pittsburgh, wrote an article regarding her attempts to obtain the FBI file kept on her during the period. Similarly, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police spied upon liberationists in Canada, as did the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation surveil WLM groups and participants in Australia. In Germany, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution () kept tabs on activists participating in women's center activities. Merely having lived in a communal housing project or been affiliated with rebellious youth movements made liberationists targets for their meeting places to be searched and materials to be confiscated.\n\nThe philosophy practiced by liberationists assumed a global sisterhood of support working to eliminate inequality without acknowledging that women were not united; other factors, such as age, class, ethnicity, and opportunity (or lack thereof) created spheres wherein women's interests diverged, and some women felt underrepresented by the WLM. While many women gained an awareness of how sexism permeated their lives, they did not become radicalized and were uninterested in overthrowing society. They made changes in their lives to address their individual needs and social arrangements, but were unwilling to take action on issues that might threaten their socio-economic status. Liberationist theory also failed to recognize a fundamental difference in fighting oppression. Combating sexism had an internal component, whereby one could change the basic power structures within family units and personal spheres to eliminate the inequality. Class struggle and the fight against racism are solely external challenges, requiring public action to eradicate inequality.\n\nThere was criticism of the movement not only from factions within the movement itself, but from outsiders, like Hugh Heffner, \"Playboy\" founder, who launched a campaign to expose all the \"highly irrational, emotional, kookie trends\" of feminism in an effort to tear apart feminist ideas that were \"unalterably opposed to the romantic boy-girl society\" promoted by his magazine. \"Women's libbers\" were widely characterized as \"man-haters\" who viewed men as enemies, advocated for all-women societies, and encouraged women to leave their families behind. Semanticist Nat Kolodney argued that while women were oppressed by social structures and rarely served in tyrannical roles over the male population as a whole, men in general were not oppressors of women either. Instead, social constructs and the difficulty of removing systems which had long served their purpose exploited both men and women. Women's liberationists acknowledged that patriarchy affects both men and women, with the former receiving many privileges from it, but focused on the impact of systemic sexism and misogyny on women throughout the world.\n\nTo many women activists in the American Indian Movement, black Civil Rights Movement, Chicana Movement, as well as Asians and other minorities, the activities of the primarily white, middle-class women in the Women's Liberation Movement were focused specifically on sex-based violence and the social construction of gender as a tool of sex-based oppression. By evaluating all economic, socio-cultural, and political issues through the lens of sexism without pairing it with racism and classism, liberationists often poorly represented women of color in their analyses. While women of color recognized that sexism was an issue, some did not see how it could be separated from the issue of race or class, which compounds to impact their access to education, health care, housing, jobs, legal justice, and the poverty and violence which permeates their lives. For women who did not speak English, or spoke it as a second language, sexism had little to do with the ability to protect herself or utilize existing systems. The focus on personal freedom was another divergence between white women and women of color. Some did not see the intrinsic connection between the liberation of women and the liberation of men that was advocated for by the Women's Liberation Movement and felt that feminists did not care about the inequalities suffered by men; they felt that the liberation of women without the liberation of men from policies that keep men of color from obtaining jobs and limit their civil rights, further preventing them from being able to protect their families, neither improved humanity as a whole nor improved the plight experienced by families. Dorothy Height, president of the National Council of Negro Women, expressed that the best way black women could help themselves was to help their men gain equality.\n\nRegarding the \"sex-positive\" sect that broke away from the women's liberation movement, extending personal freedom to sexual freedom, the meaning of being free to have relations with whoever one wanted, was lost on black women who had been sexually assaulted and raped with impunity for centuries or Native Women who were routinely sterilized. Their issues were not about limiting their families but having the freedom to form families. It had very little meaning in the traditional Chicana culture wherein women were required to be virgins until marriage and remain naïve in her marriage. Though invited to participate within the Women's Liberation Movement, many women of color cautioned against the single focus on sexism, finding it to be an incomplete analysis without the consideration of racism. Likewise, though many lesbians saw commonalities with Women's Liberation through the goals of eponymous liberation from sex-based oppression, which included fighting against homophobia, others believed that the focus was too narrow to confront the issues they faced. Differences in the understanding of gender and how it relates to and informs sex-based oppression and systemic sexism called attention to differences in issues. For example, many liberationists rejected the performance of femininity as a positive behavior, which meant that white lesbians who actively chose to perform femininity had to decide between their desire to be feminine-presenting and their rejection of sexual objectification. Jackie Anderson, an activist and philosopher, observed that in the black lesbian community being able to dress up made them feel confident because during the work week, black women had to conform to dress codes imposed upon them. This was and continues to be a sentiment held by most women, who tend to believe that the feeling of confidence derived from performing femininity as dictated by the sexist status quo is the same as empowerment.\n\nThe Women's Liberation Movement created a global awareness of patriarchy and sexism. By bringing matters that had long been considered private issues into the public view and linking those issues to deepen understanding about how systemic suppression of women's rights in society are interrelated, liberationists made innovative contributions to feminist theory. Desiring to know about women's historic contributions but often being thwarted in their search due to centuries of censoring and blocking of women's intellectual work, liberationists brought the study of power relationships, including those of sex and diversity, into the social sciences. They launched women's studies programs and publishing houses to ensure that a more culturally comprehensive history of the complex nature of society was developed.\n\nIn an effort to distance themselves from the politics and ideas of women in the Liberation Movement, as well as the personal politics which emerged, many second-wave feminists distanced themselves from the early movement. Meaghan Morris, an Australian scholar of popular culture stated that later feminists could not associate themselves with the ideas and politics of the period and maintain their respect. And yet, liberationists succeeded in pushing the dominant liberal feminists far to the left of their original aims and forced them to include goals that address sexual discrimination. Jean Curthoys argued that in the rush to distance themselves from liberationists, an unconscious amnesia rewrote the history of their movement, and failed to grasp the achievement that, without a religious connotation, the movement created an \"ethic of the irreducible value of human beings.\" Phrases that were used in the movement, like \"consciousness raising\" and \"male chauvinism,\" became keywords associated with the movement.\n\n\n\n\n"}
