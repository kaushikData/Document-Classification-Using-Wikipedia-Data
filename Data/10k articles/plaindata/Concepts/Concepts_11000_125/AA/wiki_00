{"id": "33673135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33673135", "title": "Behavioral ethics", "text": "Behavioral ethics\n\nBehavioral ethics is a new field of social scientific research that seeks to understand how people actually behave when confronted with ethical dilemmas. It refers to behavior that is judged according to generally accepted norms of behavior.\n\nIn ethics teaching and research, ethics is arguably the \"next big thing\" because its �investigation agenda has generated many knowledge on why and how people choose and act when being confronted with ethical subject, which was unknown previously.\n\nPhilosophical views about morality has been supported traditionally by theoretical reasoning and introspection, with at best passing reference to actual human behavior. Models of human morality advanced by behavioral ethics based on the fact that morality is a new and still developing quality of the evolutionary dynamic that leads to our species.\n\nClarifying the difference between behavioral law and economics(BEL) and behavioral ethics(BE) is of importance. Compared to BLE, BE has reduced its ability of influencing broad legal academic circles. In addition, unlike BLE, BE was advanced as piece of the management literature, which is less related to legal scholarship than BLE is, and thus less likely to have impact on it.\n\nBehavioral ethics researchers have found the relationship between employees' justice perceptions and also, ethical and unethical behavior. In the 1990s, organizational justice became one of the most studied organizational themes. The term organizational justice is created by Greenberg(1987) to involve employee's perception of organizational events, policies, and practices as being fair or not fair. Classic work on distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice has been built. This research has focused on theoretical advance and empirical testing about the formation of justice judgements as well as the result of these justice evaluation. Justice and injustice perception have been related to an extensive variety of employee attitudes and behaviors consisted of trust, satisfaction, turnover and plenty of opposite formal negative behaviors such as theft and unethical behaviors which are more common.\n\nThere are experiments that can be linked to behavioral ethics. The Trolley problem and the Prisoner's dilemma both place individuals in decision-making situations that carry ethical questions. In each, an individual is asked to make a decision that affects another person. In the prisoner's dilemma, the principles of Reciprocity (social psychology) and Cooperation come into play, but not all who participate behave in the same manner. In the Trolley problem an individual has to choose which group of people to save. Both of these experiments shed light on how people behave when confronted with ethical dilemmas.\n\nIf firms are able to utilize the principles of behavioral psychology to alter consumer's behavior and thus increase sales and governments can change people's behavior and hence promote policy target using those same principles, then individuals and their employers can apply related principles of behavioral ethics to promote ethical behavior in the company and in society.\n\nAccording to an article in the Chron.com, examples of unethical behavior in business an environment can include:\n\n\nThese behaviors are mostly based on different rights that we all have in society and therefore have in work environments as well. Usually each company have its own set of policy but there are some common ones as well. \n\nAt most business conference, employees are required to report on the progress of their missions. It can lead to an ethical dilemma because they may report their performance better than it is due to external pressure.\n\nUnethical behavior is an action that falls outside of what is thought morally appropriate for a person, a job or a company. Individuals can act unethically, as can businesses, professionals and politicians.\n\nEthics can be defined as going beyond what is legal and doing right things, even no one is paying attention to. So unethical behavior in business is about actions that don't obey the acceptable criterion of business operations, failing to do right things in each condition.\n"}
{"id": "39669198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39669198", "title": "Behavioural synchrony", "text": "Behavioural synchrony\n\nThe term behavioural synchrony refers to the ability of a group of agents to coordinate collective action efficiently, a concept originally introduced by a series of empirical animal and human studies, and modelling papers in animals, and humans. The agents are trying to coordinate collective action on a social network in which the communication is restricted to dyadic information flows.\n\nThe behavioural synchrony model universe relies on two key sets of assumptions. The first set of assumptions concerns the structure of the network: it is assumed that (a) the agents form a social network in a way that the network is connected, i.e., all agents have some direct or indirect connection to every other agent, and sparse, i.e., the network the agents form is not fully connected; and (b) all agents have the same network degree, i.e., every agent is connected to the same number of other agents. In network science terms, the assumption is that the agents form a \"k\"-regular \"n\"-sized connected graph, where \"k\" is the degree of the agents, and \"n\" is the number of agents. The second set of assumptions concern the nature of coordination: it is assumed that the content of the coordination is not important (independent of whether it is a linguistic cue, cultural identity, or simple compass direction), but is set up in a way that the agents cannot guess the location of the final convergence point of the group from any individual information exchange. These assumptions cause coordination to slow, where the speed is dependent on the network structure, and the agents need to think hard during the coordination process.\n\nThe behavioural synchrony approach introduced behavioural realism into social network coordination, via assuming that the network structure is similar to actual human groups, and by making the coordination process not-trivial, and thus making the modelled group processes reflect human behaviour. The behavioural synchrony approach has led to a range of human application, especially concerning the human evolutionary past:\n\nHuman behaviour\n\nHuman evolution\n\nDunbar's number\n\nRobin Dunbar\n\nSocial network\n"}
{"id": "43876021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43876021", "title": "Bellingcat", "text": "Bellingcat\n\nBellingcat (also rendered bell¿ngcat) is a website founded by the British citizen journalist Eliot Higgins. Bellingcat publishes the findings of citizen journalist investigations into war zones and the criminal underworld. The site's contributors also publish guides to their techniques, as well as case studies.\n\nBellingcat began as an investigation of the use of weapons in the Syrian civil war. It first received international attention with its analysis of forged data on satellite images of the downing of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 during the still ongoing war in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe name derives from the idiom \"belling the cat\", which comes from a medieval fable about mice who discuss how to make a cat harmless. One suggests hooking a bell around his neck, and all the mice support the idea but none is willing to do it.\n\nIn March 2012, Eliot Higgins started a blog under the pseudonym Brown Moses, through which he published his research into video footage of the Syrian Civil War. He looked at hundreds of these short clips on the Internet, localized them, and examined details of the weapons used. As a result, Higgins was able to demonstrate that the Syrian regime was using cluster munitions and chemical weapons. In 2013, Higgins linked the significant chemical attack in Ghouta (the Ghouta chemical attack) to Bashar al-Assad.\n\nOnce Bellingcat was launched, major ground was covered over the course of its first investigation, the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17). Bellingcat concluded that the downing was initiated by the Russian military; this was later confirmed by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), which found in a report dated 25 May 2018 that the downing of MH17 was initiated by the Russian military. In other notable investigations using Google Earth, analysts from Bellingcat said that they had discovered the coordinates of an Islamic State training camp, as well as the site where an American journalist was killed.\n\nKristyan Benedict, an Amnesty International campaign manager, told \"The New Yorker\" in 2013 that many organisations had analysts but that Higgins was faster than many established investigation teams.\n\nHiggins launched the Bellingcat platform in 2014 with the help of private donations received through the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. Half of funding comes from grants and donations, the other half from running workshops training people in the art of open-source investigations. For example, Bellingcat has received grants from Google Digital News Initiative, Adessium, and the Open Society Foundations. The organisation publishes guides on how to analyse data and how to create reports, such as \"How to Scrape Interactive Geospacial Data\" and \"How to Identify Burnt Villages by Satellite Imagery\".\n\nAs of 2018, the company has four full-time staff plus Higgins, 11 members of its investigation team and 60 contributors. The office is in Leicester.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, a report by Bellingcat was published which analyses the use of Russian artillery in the summer of 2014 against Ukrainian villages.\n\nOn July 17, 2014 Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a passenger flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down while flying over eastern Ukraine. All 283 passengers and 15 crew members died after the Boeing 777 was hit by a burst of \"high-energy objects\".\n\nIn a press conference, Russian officials blamed the flight's destruction on Ukrainian forces and presented radar data, expert testimony and a satellite image. The radar data that showed another aircraft in the vicinity of MH17 was debunked as falling debris from MH17 by experts. A Spanish air traffic controller in Kiev gave interviews that stated that two Ukrainian fighter jets followed the Malaysian plane but the Spanish Embassy later said that there was no Spanish air traffic controller at either of Kiev's airports. The satellite image showed an aircraft firing on the airliner but Bellingcat exposed the photo as a composite of Google images, with the Malaysian airline logo even being misplaced.\n\nOn November 9, 2014, the Bellingcat MH17 Investigation team published a report titled “MH17: Source of the Separatists’ Buk”. Based on evidence from open sources, primarily social media, the report links a Buk missile launcher that was filmed and photographed in eastern Ukraine on July 17 to the downing of the MH17 flight. The 35 page report, including photographs and maps, details the movements of the Buk in eastern Ukraine on July 17, evidence that the Buk originated from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade in Kursk, Russia, along with a convoy headed towards the Ukrainian border, and the activity of the vehicles seen in the same convoy after July 17. This report was later echoed by the Dutch-led international Joint Investigation Team. The head of the Netherlands’ National Crime Squad, said they officially concluded that the missile that shot down MH17 \"is from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade from Kursk in the Russian Federation\".\n\nIn June 2015, Bellingcat published evidence that Russia had used Adobe Photoshop to manipulate satellite images of the MH17 disaster. Image forensics expert Jens Kriese of Germany maintained that Bellingcat's report used invalid methods to reach its conclusion. In a follow-up report, Bellingcat published crowdfunded satellite imagery and further analysis that supported their claim. \n\nOn December 20, 2017, Bellingcat published an article focusing on a section of the 2017 Intelligence and Security Committee report, which categorically stated that the British stance on the MH17 incident was that Russian forces were behind the orchestration and implementation of a plan to shoot down an aircraft. Whether the target was the MH17 passenger jet is not defined.\n\nBeginning in March 2011 after political protests turned violent, the Syrian Civil War has been an ongoing conflict between the Syrian Arab Republic, Syrian Opposition, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and other combatants. Bellingcat reports primarily analyse the factions at war, and what weapons and armor they utilize, as well as news that would normally go unreported by the mainstream media. Bellingcat utilizes a network of contributors who specialize in open source and social media investigation, and creates guides and case studies so others may learn to do the same.\n\nIn April 2014, Bellingcat published extensive evidence of chemical weapons being used on Syrian civilians, including children. Collecting and analysing video footage from local sources which apparently showed parts of chlorine cylinders, Higgins said that while the contents of the cylinders could not be verified \"the injuries depicted in the videos all appear to be consistent with chemical exposure\".\n\nIn June 2016, Bellingcat published an article showing the use of cluster munitions were being used against the New Syrian Army, in clear violation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions. Bellingcat provided photographic evidence from firsthand sources that the munitions used were identical to those used by the Russian Military .\n\nIn February 2017, Bellingcat published an article detailing how rudimentary drones were being used by ISIS to drop explosives onto opposition targets. Analysing footage from Twitter and other social media platforms, it was discovered that the drones were dropping modified 40mm grenades.\n\nBellingcat also does extensive reporting into attacks that are not openly claimed by combatants.\n\nIn September 2016, Bellingcat released a fact-checking article in response to Russia denying the bombing of hospitals in Syria. The article analysed footage from YouTube and images from Facebook, cross referencing them with areas that were confirmed to be attacked by Russian forces. The article reported that the hospital in question was within the area under Russian attack, although Russia denies these claims.\n\nIn March 2017, Bellingcat published an investigative report on the bombing of a mosque in Aleppo that killed over 50 civilians. The article included photographs of the remnants of the bomb used, and showed that the piece was identical to that of similar bombs used by the US military.\n\nBellingcat published that in the 2018 Hajjah Governorate airstrike the bomb was made by the American company Raytheon.\n\nIn November 2018, a Bellingcat investigation on Houthi broadcasts through their affiliated Almasirah news channel of missile attacks targeted against United Arab Emirates (UAE) airports the Abu Dhabi International Airport and Dubai International Airport was published. The investigation report concluded that \"It is highly likely that a Houthi-led drone attack did not take place in Abu Dhabi or Dubai\". According to the report, the claims of the attacks constituted a a propaganda effort and followed a \"propaganda pattern\" claims by the Houthi leaders.\n\nFollowing RT's interview with the suspects of the Sergei Skripal poisoning case, Bellingcat published the suspects’ passport data showing inconsistencies in the official story, and possible links to the Russian secret service. The Russian foreign ministry rejected the report stating that it believed Bellingcat had ties to western intelligence. It noted Bellingcat's access to a Russian database not publicly available. Shortly after, the website said it had identified one of the suspects as decorated GRU colonel Anatoliy Chepiga.\n\nIn 2015, Eliot Higgins and Bellingcat received the special prize of the Hanns-Joachim-Friedrichs-Award.\n\n"}

The rally was held calling for a new and cleaner electoral system in Malaysia. A Bersih convoy was also launched and targeted all parts of Malaysia to raise awareness of the current democratic problems nationwide.\n\nIncumbent Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has denied any wrongdoing amidst the ongoing 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal and former premier Mahathir Mohamad has come out in support of pro Bersih campaigners.\n\nSteven Gan, an editor of an online news website Malaysiakini was charged in court under the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission Act for the reporting of Prime Minister Najib and 1Malaysia Development Berhad, leading up to the rally.\n\nThe Red Shirts were basically formed to opposed the activities of Bersih, especially its criticisms of the government and to support the government. Many members of the Red Shirts consists of UMNO, which is the ruling party in Malaysia.\n\nThe pro government group led by Jamal Yunos indicates that the Red Shirts will confront the yellow shirt Bersih protesters during the stipulated rally on 19 November 2016. In a prelude encounter, Jamal Yunos was injured with his nose bloodied in Ampang during a filmed scuffle with the police, with Jamal shouting that he was punched by the police. He later changed his statement because he was threatened by the government, claiming he was punched by a Bersih supporter.\n\nBersih organised a convoy of vehicles to tour parts of Peninsula Malaysia and the states of Sabah and Sarawak to disseminate information to the public about the Bersih's goals regarding institutional reforms and creating awareness about the 1MDB scandal. Throughout their nationwide roadshow in Peninsula Malaysia, the Bersih convoy had to endure harassment from anti-Bersih groups such as the Red Shirts and the police.\n\nThe Malaysian police, during their raid on Bersih's office in Petaling Jaya arrested Bersih chairperson Maria Chin Abdullah and secretariat Mandeep Singh for their part in organising the rally. \nMaria Chin was charged under the Security Offences Act 2012, with the police saying that it was to prevent riots and breach of the peace and public order. Ronnie Liu, an opposition leader of the Democratic Action Party was arrested as well on charges on attempting a riot. Anthony Loke, another member of DAP was also arrested in an investigation on his speech calling for the removal of Prime Minister Najib. S Arulchelvan, an opposition leader from Parti Sosialis Malaysia was arrested in Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur. Another member of the Bersih committee, Hishamuddin Rais was arrested a few hours before the rally began. Bersih officials have condemned the arrest as a blatant abuse of power and harassment by the authorities.\n\nThe leader of the Red Shirts, a group opposing Bersih and their Yellow Shirt followers, Jamal Yunos was arrested a few hours before the Bersih rally began.\n\nThe counter-rally by the Red Shirts ended prematurely after they were unable to get past the police blockade to confront the Bersih rally-goers, with a majority of them dispersing at Padang Merbok.\n\nEven though the protests ended peacefully, the arrests against Bersih protestors such as People's Justice Party (Malaysia)'s Tian Chua and Zuraida Kamaruddin were conducted.\n\nThen Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak who was in Tokyo, said that Malaysians should respect the law and avoid chaos and physical clashes. He also claimed that Malaysians should elect their leaders without having to protest as it was not Malaysia's culture, despite the fact that right of peaceful assembly (which Bersih exercised) is legally provided for in Malaysia.\n\nInspector General of Police, Khalid Abu Bakar stated that Bersih 5 does not fulfil the Section 10(c) and Section 11 of Peaceful Assembly Act 2012 as there was no consent letter was produced for the venue of the rally, Dataran Merdeka.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International have condemned the spate of arrests by the government of Malaysian activists as a form of intimidation and harassment against dissent.\n\n"}
{"id": "226105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226105", "title": "Bill Drummond", "text": "Bill Drummond\n\nWilliam Ernest Drummond (born 29 April 1953) is a Scottish artist, musician, writer, and record producer. He was the co-founder of late 1980s avant-garde pop group The KLF and its 1990s media-manipulating successor, the K Foundation, with which he famously burned £1 million in 1994. More recent art activities, carried out under Drummond's chosen banner of the Penkiln Burn, include making and distributing cakes, soup, flowers, beds and shoe-shines. More recent music projects include No Music Day, and the international tour of a choir called The17. Drummond is the author of several books about art and music.\n\nWilliam Ernest Drummond was born in Butterworth, South Africa, where his father was a minister for the Church of Scotland. His family moved back to Scotland when he was 18 months old, and his early years were spent in the town of Newton Stewart. He moved to Corby, Northamptonshire at the age of 11. It was here that he first became involved in performing as a musician, initially working with school friends such as Gary Carson and Chris Ward. He attended the University of Northampton and the Art and Design Academy from 1970 to 1973. He later decided that \"art should use everything, be everywhere\" and that, as an artist, he would \"use whatever medium is to hand\". He spent two years working as a milkman, gardener, steel worker, nursing assistant, theatre carpenter, and scene painter.\n\nIn 1975 Drummond began working at the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool as a carpenter and scene painter. In 1976 he was the set designer for the first stage production of \"The Illuminatus Trilogy\", a 12-hour performance which opened on 23 November 1976, and which was staged by Ken Campbell's \"Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool\". This production then transferred to the National Theatre in London. According to Campbell, Drummond became known as \"the man who went for Araldite\": \"In the middle of a tour, Drummond announced he was popping out to get some glue – and never returned.\"\n\nDrummond's musical career began in 1977 with Big in Japan, a band whose membership also included future luminaries Holly Johnson (Frankie Goes to Hollywood), Budgie (Siouxsie and the Banshees), Jayne Casey (Pink Military/Pink Industry) and Ian Broudie (The Lightning Seeds). After the band's demise, Drummond and another member David Balfe started Zoo Records, their first release being Big in Japan's posthumous EP, \"From Y To Z and Never Again\". They went on to act as producers of the debut albums by Echo & the Bunnymen and The Teardrop Explodes, both of which Drummond would later manage somewhat idiosyncratically. With Zoo Music Ltd, Drummond and Balfe were also music publishers for Zodiac Mindwarp & The Love Reaction and The Proclaimers. The production team of Drummond and Balfe was christened The Chameleons, who recorded the single \"Touch\" together with singer Lori Lartey as Lori and the Chameleons.\n\nDrummond later took a job in the mainstream music business as an A&R consultant for the label WEA working with Strawberry Switchblade and Brilliant. In July 1986, on his 33 and a third birthday, Drummond repented his corporate involvement and resigned his job by way of a \"ringingly quixotic press release\": \"I will be 33.5 (sic) years old in September, a time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, and I want to see the world from the top...\" (In an interview in December 1990, Drummond recalled spending half a million pounds at WEA on the band Brilliant – for whom he envisioned massive worldwide success – only for them to completely flop. \"At that point I thought 'What am I doing this for?' and I got out.\")\n\nDrummond was \"obviously very sharp,\" said WEA chairman Rob Dickens, \"and he knew the business. But he was too radical to be happy inside a corporate structure. He was better off working as an outsider.\"\n\nLater in the year, Drummond issued a solo album, \"The Man\", a country/folk music recording, backed by Australian rock group The Triffids. The album was released on Creation Records and included the sardonic \"Julian Cope Is Dead\", where he outlined his fantasy of shooting the Teardrop Explodes frontman in the head to ensure the band's early demise and subsequent legendary status. The song has commonly been seen as a reply to the Cope song \"Bill Drummond Said\". As a B-side, Drummond wrote and recorded \"The Manager\" in which he lamented the state of the music industry and offered his services to help fix it.\n\n\"The Man\" received positive reviews – including 4 stars from \"Q Magazine\"; and 5 from \"Sounds\" Magazine who called the album a \"touching if idiosyncratic biographical statement\". Drummond intended to focus on writing books once \"The Man\" had been issued but, as he recalled in 1990, \"That only lasted three months, until I had an[other] idea for a record and got dragged back into it all\".\n\nWhile out walking on New Years Day 1987, Drummond formulated a plan to make a hip-hop record. However, \"I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself\", he said. \"...although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I thought, I knew Jimmy [Cauty], I knew he was a like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said 'Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu'. And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, 'where I was coming from'\".\n\nDrummond and Cauty (who Drummond had signed to Food/WEA as a member of Brilliant) released their first single, The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu's \"All You Need Is Love\", in March 1987. This was followed by an album – \"1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)\" – in June of the same year, and a high-profile copyright dispute with ABBA and the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society. A second album – \"Who Killed The JAMs?\", also the last album under the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs) name, was released in February 1988.\n\nLater in 1988, Drummond and Cauty released a 'novelty' pop single, \"Doctorin' the Tardis\" as The Timelords. The song reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 12 June, and charted highly in Australia and New Zealand. On the back of this success, the duo self-published a book, \"The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)\".\n\nIn late 1988, the duo was renamed The KLF and released their first singles under this moniker, \"Burn the Bastards\" and \"Burn the Beat\" (both taken from the JAMs' last album). (From late 1987, Drummond and Cauty's independent record label had been named \"KLF Communications\".) As The KLF, Drummond and Cauty would amass fame and fortune. \"What Time Is Love?\" – a signature song which they would revisit and revitalise several times in the coming years – saw its first release in July 1988, and its success spawned an album, \"The \"What Time Is Love?\" Story\", in September 1989.\n\n\"Chill Out\", an ambient house album which had its roots in Cauty's chill-out sessions with The Orb's Alex Paterson, was released in February 1990. Described by \"The Times\" as \"The KLF's comedown classic\", \"Chill Out\" was named the fifth best dance album of all time in a 1996 \"Mixmag\" feature.\n\nThe KLF's commercial success peaked in 1991, with \"The White Room\" album and the accompanying \"Stadium House\" singles, remixes of 1988's \"What Time Is Love?\", 1989's \"3 a.m. Eternal\", 1990's \"Last Train to Trancentral\"; and \"Justified and Ancient\", a new song based on a sample from \"1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)\"\n\nIn 1992, The KLF were awarded the \"Best British group\" BRIT Award. With grindcore group Extreme Noise Terror, The KLF performed a live \"violently antagonistic performance\" of \"3 a.m. Eternal\" at the BRIT Awards ceremony in front of \"a stunned music-business audience\". \n\nLater in the evening Drummond and Cauty dumped a dead sheep with the message \"I died for you —bon appetit \" tied around its waist at the entrance to one of the post-ceremony parties. \"NME\" listed this appearance at number 4 in their \"top 100 rock moments\", and, in 2003, \"The Observer\" named it the fifth greatest \"publicity stunt\" in the history of popular music.\n\nOn 14 May 1992, The KLF announced their immediate retirement from the music industry and the deletion of their \"entire\" back catalogue, an act which associate Scott Piering described as \"[throwing] away a fortune\". \n\nAs when he left WEA, Drummond issued an enigmatic press release, this time talking of a \"wild and wounded, glum and glorious, shit but shining path\" he and Cauty had been following \"...these past five years. The last two of which has led us up onto the commercial high ground—we are at a point where the path is about to take a sharp turn from these sunny uplands down into a netherworld of we know not what.\" There have been numerous suggestions that in 1992 Drummond was at the edge of a nervous breakdown. \"Vox\" Magazine wrote, for example, that 1992 was \"the year of Bill's 'breakdown', when The KLF, perched on the peak of greater-than-ever success, quit the music business, ... [and] machine gunned the tuxedo'd twats in the front row of that year's BRIT Awards ceremony.\" Drummond himself said that he was on the edge of the \"abyss\".\n\nDespite The KLF's retirement from the music business, Drummond's involvement with Jimmy Cauty was far from over. In 1993, the pair regrouped as the K Foundation, ostensibly a foundation for the arts. They established the K Foundation art award for the \"\"worst\" artist of the year\". The award, worth £40,000, was presented to Rachel Whiteread on 23 November 1993 outside London's Tate Gallery. Ms Whiteread had just accepted the £20,000 1993 Turner Prize award for best British Contemporary artist inside the gallery. The K Foundation award attracted huge interest from the British broadsheet newspapers.\n\nInfamy followed when, on 23 August 1994, the K Foundation burnt what remained of The KLF's earnings – one million pounds sterling – at a boathouse on the Scottish island of Jura. A film of the event – \"Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid\" – was taken on tour, with Drummond and Cauty discussing the incineration with members of the public after each screening. In 2004 Drummond admitted to the BBC that he now regretted burning the money. \"It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier. I wish I could explain why I did it so people would understand.\"\n\nOn 4 September 1995 the duo recorded \"The Magnificent\" for \"The Help Album\". In 1997, Drummond and Cauty briefly re-emerged as 2K and K2 Plant Hire Ltd. with various plans to \"Fuck the Millennium\". K2 Plant Hire's published aim was to \"build a massive pyramid containing one brick for every person born in the UK during the 20th century\" Members of the public were urged to donate bricks, with 1.5 bricks per Briton being needed to complete the project. Drummond also contributed a short story titled \"Let’s Grind, or How K2 Plant Hire Ltd Went to Work\" to the book \"Disco 2000\".\n\nDrummond studied painting at Liverpool School of Art from 1972 to 1973. Following that, he decided that instead of limiting his practice to paint and canvas, as an artist he would use any medium that came to hand. He has said that much of his work since – including the pop-music, book-writing, and The17 choir – has been done as art.\n\nFrom 1998, Drummond's art activities have been carried out using the brand-name of the Penkiln Burn. This is the name of the river in Scotland upon the banks of which he played and fished as a boy.\n\nIn 1995, Drummond bought \"A Smell of Sulphur in the Wind\" by Richard Long, for $20,000. In Drummond’s own words, he ‘fell in love with Richard Long’s work because’ \"it was art by walking and doing things on his walks.\" Five years later, Drummond felt that he was no longer \"getting his money's worth\" from the photograph. He decided to try to sell it by placing a series of placards around the country. When this failed to result in its sale, in 2001 he cut the photograph and mounting card into 20,000 pieces to sell for $1 each. His plan, upon retrieving the $20,000 in cash, is to walk with it to the remote place in Iceland where Richard Long had made the photograph and bury it in a box beneath the stone circle. He will then take his own photograph of the site, bring it home, frame it, hang it in the same place in his bedroom where the Richard Long hung, and call the new work \"The Smell of Money Underground\". Drummond's books \"How to be an Artist\" and a later soft-bound edition titled \"$20,000\" recounts this story.\n\nIn 2002, Drummond was involved in a controversial exhibition at the deconsecrated St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Liverpool. Drummond contributed a guestbook which asked visitors \"Is God a Cunt?\". It was later reported that the artwork had been stolen and a £1000 reward offered for its return. Drummond himself said that he would answer \"no\" to his own question: \"God is responsible for all the things I love, the speckles on a brown trout; the sound of Angus Young's guitar, the nape of my girlfriend's neck, the song of the blackcap when he returns in Spring. I never blame God for all the shit, for the baby Rwandan slaughtered in a casual genocide, the ever-present wars, drudgery and misery that fills most of our lives.\"\n\nSeveral Penkiln Burn projects involve making things and then distributing them. Drummond has created a Soup Line drawn across a map going through Belfast and Nottingham to the edges of the British Isles. Anyone living on the Soup Line may contact Drummond to come to their house and make soup for them, their family and friends. Drummond has also constructed – and encourages others to construct – Cake Circles drawn on maps. Cakes are then made and delivered to people who live within the circle with the words \"I have baked you a cake, here it is\". Other projects involve Drummond building beds from timber in public places which are then raffled off. In 2011, for the Venice Biennale, Drummond took up shoe-shining on the streets of Venice. Each spring, Drummond gives away 40 bunches of daffodils to strangers on the street in different cities.\n\nDrummond's web-based projects include MyDeath.net, where people can plan their own funeral. Another site, youwhores.com, was meant for anyone to advertise any kind of service at their own set price. Due to misuse though, youwhores.com has become archival only. Still open for contributions is Drummond's website www.openmanifesto.com which \"exists to define what art is and art is not.\" The Open Manifesto site invites definitions of art in 100 words or less.\n\nDrummond was a Director of The Foundry, an arts centre in Shoreditch, London which closed in 2010. He is also owner of The Curfew Tower in Cushendall, Northern Ireland. Via an arts trust called In You We Trust, the Curfew Tower acts as an artists' residency.\n\nWith Jimmy Cauty, Bill Drummond announced his retirement from pop-music with a dramatic performance involving deactivated machine guns, a dead sheep and a grindcore version of the KLF hit 3am Eternal at the 1992 BRIT Awards. His involvement in the music industry more widely has been minimal since his final collaboration with Jimmy Cauty as 2K in 1997.\n\nIn 1998, the Scottish Football Association invited Drummond to write and record a theme song for the Scotland national football team's 1998 FIFA World Cup campaign. Drummond decided against doing it (Del Amitri got the job) but he wondered if he had twisted fate by declining, because the other major football songs of that year were made by associates of his: Keith Allen (\"Vindaloo\") and Ian Broudie (\"Three Lions\"), two men he had met on the same day when working on \"Illuminatus!\" in 1976, and former protege Ian McCulloch.\n\nIn 2000, Drummond released \"45\", a book consisting of a \"series of loosely related vignettes forming the rambling diary of one year.\" \"45\" also explored Drummond's KLF legacy, and was well received by the press.\n\nIn 2005, Drummond announced an annual No Music Day on 21 November. The 22 November is Saint Cecilia day – the Patron Saint of Music – so No Music Day represents a fast before the feast. No Music Day was held between 2005 and 2010. In this time, BBC Radio Scotland observed it by broadcasting no music, including jingles, for 24 hours. Radio Resonance FM also acknowledged it. In 2009 the entire city of Linz, Austria observed No Music Day with the backing of the city mayor; music was not played on local radio stations or in shops, and the cinemas only showed films without music soundtracks. No Music Day is documented at www.nomusicday.com\n\nDrummond's most recent music project is a choir called The17. His first formal performance of The17 was staged with 16 other men in a studio in Leicester in 2004. It followed thoughts about music that Drummond had been having for many years. With the advent of recorded music via the internet, iPods and MP3 players etc. Drummond proclaims that \"all recorded music has run its course.\" The17 creates music that follows no musical history, or necessarily has words, melodies or rhythms. It may be made up of many human voices or none. Performances may only be recorded and played back once and then deleted. The17 can be made up of as many people who want to be a part of it at the time of a performance; they are all then lifetime members.\n\nThe17 now has several thousand members who have carried out performances on Drummond's Coast-to-Coast tour across the UK, and a World Tour which has included Jerusalem, Beijing, Port-au-Prince and Gothenburg. The17 is the subject of the 2008 book \"17\" published by Beautiful Books. Performances, scores, tours and Drummond's related graffiti are documented on a website: the17.org.\n\nA performance of The17's SURROUND, originally planned to take place in Damascus, Syria, will take place in London on 18 March 2012. Drummond explains in his essay for Treuchet Magazine: 'it would best for all concerned if the Syrian leg of the tri-nation festival was postponed for a few weeks or maybe months, when things would have undoubtedly settled down'.\n\nOn 28 April 2013, the day before his 60th birthday, Drummond took part in what has been billed as the last performance of The17. A seventeen-hour version of Score 1: IMAGINE was performed while standing on a manhole cover at the bottom of Mathew Street in Liverpool.\n\nIn February 2014, Drummond announced plans for a world tour, beginning under Spaghetti Junction in Birmingham on 13 March 2014 and ending at the same place on the 28 April 2025. Taking in twelve cities in twelve different countries, each leg of the tour will last three months, during which he will produce 25 Paintings whilst working on other art projects.\n\nIn 1993, \"Select\" magazine published a list of the 100 Coolest People in Pop. Drummond was number one on the list. \"What has this giant of coolness not achieved?\", they asked: \"Like the Monolith in , Drummond has always been a step ahead of human evolution, guiding us on. Manager of The Teardrop Explodes, co-inventor of ambient and trance house, number one pop star, situationist pagan, folk troubadour, pan-dimensional zenarchist gentleman of leisure...and then, ladies and gentlemen, he THROWS IT ALL AWAY, machine-guns the audience and dumps a dead sheep on the doorstep of the Brit Awards and vanishes to build dry-stone walls. His new 'band' The K Foundation make records but say they won't release them at all until world peace is established. Deranged, inspired, intensely cool.\"\n\nAlso in 1993, an \"NME\" piece about the K Foundation found much to praise in Drummond's career, from Zoo Records through to the K Foundation art award: \"Bill Drummond's career is like no other... there's been cynicism... and there's been care (no one who didn't love pop music could have made a record so commercial and so Pet Shop Boys-lovely as 'Kylie Said to Jason', or the madly wonderful 'Last Train to Trancentral', or the Tammy Wynette version of 'Justified and Ancient'). There's been mysticism... But most of all there's been a belief that, both in music and life, there's something more.\"\n\nCharles Shaar Murray wrote in \"The Independent\" that \"[Bill] Drummond is many things, and one of those things is a magician. Many of his schemes... involve symbolically-weighted acts conducted away from the public gaze and documented only by Drummond himself and his participating comrades. Nevertheless, they are intended to have an effect on a worldful of people unaware that the act in question has taken place. That is magical thinking. Art is magic, and so is pop. Bill Drummond is a cultural magician...\"\n\nIn 2001, NME readers voted \"the KLF's Art Terrorism\" at the Brit Awards in 1992 at number 4 in the \"top 100 Rock moments of all time.\" NME also ranked Drummond as number 17 in its 20 \"Greatest Cult Heroes\" in 2010.\n\nArt Review's artworld \"Power 100\" listed Drummond as number 98 in 2003.\n\n\"Trouser Press\" has referred to Drummond as a \"high-concept joker\"; and Britain's \"The Sun\" has called him a \"madcap Scots genius\".\n\nIn 2006, Drummond's book \"45\" was ranked 21 in the Observer's list of \"The 50 greatest music books ever\". Kitty Empire of the Guardian included \"45\" in her list of \"10 best music memoirs\". in 2010. \"45\" also featured in a 2010 book list compiled by Belle & Sebastian.\n\nBBC Radio 1 in 2006 included Drummond in a survey of \"Most Punk Persons\".\n\nJulian Cope said in 2000, \"I have no relationship with this guy. He burned a million pounds which was not all his, and some of it was mine. People should pay off their creditors before they pull intellectual dry-wank stunts like that.\"\n\nVirgin Media ranked Drummond at number 8 in a list of \"Most Eccentric Musicians\" and freakytrigger.com polled him as the fourth \"most intelligent person in pop\".\n\nDrummond's 1986 solo album \"The Man\" is among Uncut Magazine's 2010 list of \"Greatest Lost Albums\".\n\n\n\n\nBill Drummond is a fan of Scottish football club Queen of the South which he says is due to their proximity to his home town of Newton Stewart. \"Queen of the South\" is also the title of the 6th track on his 1986 album \"The Man\".\n"}
{"id": "1719952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1719952", "title": "Comparative research", "text": "Comparative research\n\nComparative research is a research methodology in the social sciences that aims to make comparisons across different countries or cultures. A major problem in comparative research is that the data sets in different countries may not use the same categories, or define categories differently (for example by using different definitions of poverty).\n\nAs Moutsios argues, cross-cultural and comparative research should be seen as part of the scientific spirit that arose in Greece in the 6th century and the overall appreciation of knowledge and learning that was characteristic of the 5th century. In other words, it is part of the emergence of \"episteme\" and \"philo-sophia\", as a love for knowledge that is independent from material benefits. \"Episteme\", as a form and activity in the field of \"logos\", marked the break of cognitive closure and advanced empirical inquiry, logical argumentation and the search for truth. And the high esteem for intellectual activity gave rise to a genuine curiosity about other cultures – which has lain thereafter at the heart of comparative inquiry.\n\nMoreover, behind the Greek comparative gaze also was the philosophical and political questioning which characterised the life of the democratic \"polis\". Philosophical inquiry, from the Milesians down to the Sophists, questioned the representations and the cognitive traditions of their own people; the inquiry of the traditions of other peoples was, as Herodotus’ \"Histories\" demonstrate, an activity associated with the ethos of philosophical critique that characterised democratic life in Greece. Similarly, questioning of the Greek laws and institutions and its related values and practices (e.g. \"isegoria\" and \"parrhesia\"), as part of Greek politics, is associated with the effort of the first historians to reflect on home institutions through researching those of others.\n\nAccording also to Karl Deutsch, we have been using this form of investigation for over 2,000 years. Comparing things is essential to basic scientific and philosophic inquiry, which has been done for a long time. Most authors are more conservative in their estimate of how long comparative research has been with us. It is largely an empty debate over the definition of the tradition with those questioning whether comparing things counts as comparative research.\n\nTextbooks on this form of study were beginning to appear by the 1880s, but its rise to extreme popularity began after World War II. There are numerous reasons that comparative research has come to take a place of honour in the toolbox of the social scientist. Globalization has been a major factor, increasing the desire and possibility for educational exchanges and intellectual curiosity about other cultures. Information technology has enabled greater production of quantitative data for comparison, and international communications technology has facilitated this information to be easily spread.\n\nComparative research, simply put, is the act of comparing two or more things with a view to discovering something about one or all of the things being compared. This technique often utilizes multiple disciplines in one study. When it comes to method, the majority agreement is that there is no methodology peculiar to comparative research. The multidisciplinary approach is good for the flexibility it offers, yet comparative programs do have a case to answer against the call that their research lacks a \"seamless whole.\" \n\nThere are certainly methods that are far more common than others in comparative studies, however. Quantitative analysis is much more frequently pursued than qualitative, and this is seen by the majority of comparative studies which use quantitative data. The general method of comparing things is the same for comparative research as it is in our everyday practice of comparison. Like cases are treated alike, and different cases are treated differently; the extent of difference determines how differently cases are to be treated. If one is able to sufficiently distinguish two carry the research conclusions will not be very helpful. \n\nSecondary analysis of quantitative data is relatively widespread in comparative research, undoubtedly in part because of the cost of obtaining primary data for such large things as a country's policy environment. This study is generally aggregate data analysis. Comparing large quantities of data (especially government sourced) is prevalent. A typical method of comparing welfare states is to take balance of their levels of spending on social welfare.\n\nIn line with how a lot of theorizing has gone in the last century, comparative research does not tend to investigate \"grand theories,\" such as Marxism. It instead occupies itself with middle-range theories that do not purport to describe our social system in its entirety, but a subset of it. A good example of this is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related. The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of decommodification of social welfare goods. He found that he was able to class welfare states into three types, based on their level of decommodification. He further theorized from this that decommodification was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy. Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of decommodification, then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.\n\nComparative research can take many forms. Two key factors are space and time. Spatially, cross-national comparisons are by far the most common, although comparisons within countries, contrasting different areas, cultures or governments also subsist and are very constructive, especially in a country like New Zealand, where policy often changes depending on which race it pertains to. Recurrent interregional studies include comparing similar or different countries or sets of countries, comparing one's own country to others or to the whole world.\n\nThe historical comparative research involves comparing different time-frames. The two main choices within this model are comparing two stages in time (either snapshots or time-series), or just comparing the same thing over time, to see if a policy's effects differ over a stretch of time.\n\nWhen it comes to subject matter of comparative inquiries, many contend there is none unique to it. This may indeed be true, but a brief perusal of comparative endeavours reveals there are some topics more recurrent than others. Determining whether socioeconomic or political factors are more important in explaining government action is a familiar theme. In general, however, the only thing that is certain in comparative research issues is the existence of differences to be analysed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38223205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38223205", "title": "Cultural conflict", "text": "Cultural conflict\n\nCultural conflict is a type of conflict that occurs when different cultural values and beliefs clash. It has been used to explain violence and crime.\n\nJonathan H. Turner defines it as a conflict caused by \"differences in cultural values and beliefs that place people at odds with one another\". On a micro level, Alexander Grewe discusses a cultural conflict between guests of different culture and nationality as seen in a British 1970 sitcom, \"Fawlty Towers\". He defines this conflict as one that occurs when people's expectations of a certain behavior coming from their cultural backgrounds are not met, as others have different cultural backgrounds and different expectations.\n\nCultural conflicts are difficult to resolve as parties to the conflict have different beliefs. Cultural conflicts intensify when those differences become reflected in politics, particularly on a macro level. An example of cultural conflict is the debate over abortion. Ethnic cleansing is another extreme example of cultural conflict. Wars can also be a result of a cultural conflict; for example the differing views on slavery were one of the reasons for the American civil war.\n\nA more narrow definition of a cultural conflict dates to Daniel Bell's 1962 essay, \"Crime as an American Way of Life\", and focuses on criminal-enabling consequences of a clash in cultural values. William Kornblum defines it as a conflict that occurs when conflicting norms create \"opportunities for deviance and criminal gain in deviant sub-cultures\". Kornblum notes that whenever laws impose cultural values on a group that does not share those views (often, this is the case of the majority imposing their laws on a minority), illegal markets supplied by criminals are created to circumvent those laws. He discusses the example of prohibition in the interbellum United States, and notes how the cultural conflict between pro- and anti-alcohol groups created opportunities for illegal activity; another similar example he lists is that of the war on drugs.\n\nKornblum also classifies the cultural conflict as one of the major types of conflict theory. In \"The Clash of Civilizations\" Samuel P. Huntington proposes that people's cultural and religious identities will be the primary source of conflict in the post-Cold War world.\n\nMichelle LeBaron describes different cultures as \"underground rivers that run through our lives and relationships, giving us messages that shape our perceptions, attributions, judgments, and ideas of self and other\". She states that cultural messages \"shape our understandings\" when two or more people are present in regards to relationships, conflict, and peace. LeBaron discusses the influence of culture as being powerful and \"unconscious, influencing conflict and attempts to resolve conflict in imperceptible ways\". She states that the impact of culture is huge, affecting \"name, frame, blame, and attempt to tame conflicts\". Due to the huge impact that culture has on us, LeBaron finds it important to explain the \"complications of conflict\". First, \"culture is multi-layered\", meaning that \"what you see on the surface may mask differences below the surface\". Second, \"culture is constantly in flux\", meaning that \"cultural groups adapt in dynamic and sometimes unpredictable ways\". Third, \"culture is elastic\", meaning that one member of a cultural group may not participate in the norms of the culture. Lastly, \"culture is largely below the surface\", meaning that it isn't easy to reach the deeper levels of culture and its meanings.\n"}
{"id": "3317874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3317874", "title": "Cycle of violence", "text": "Cycle of violence\n\nThe term cycle of violence refers to repeated and dangerous acts of violence as a cyclical pattern, associated with high emotions and doctrines of retribution or revenge. The pattern, or cycle, repeats and can happen many times during a relationship. Each phase may last a different length of time, and over time the level of violence may increase. The phrase has been increasingly widespread since first popularised in the 1970s.\n\nIt often refers to violent behavior learned as a child, and then repeated as an adult, therefore continuing on in a perceived cycle.\n\nA cycle of abuse generally follows the following pattern: \n\nA cyclical nature of domestic violence is most prevalent in intimate terrorism (IT), which involve a pattern of ongoing control using emotional, physical and other forms of domestic violence and is what generally leads victims, who are most often women, to women's shelters. It is what was traditionally the definition of domestic violence and is generally illustrated with the \"Power and Control Wheel\" to illustrate the different and inter-related forms of abuse. Intimate terrorism is different from situational couple violence, which are isolated incidents of varying degrees of intensity.\n\nA general, intricate and complicated cycle of traumatic violence and healing map was developed by Olga Botcharova when she worked at the Center for International Studies.\n\nIntergenerational cycles of violence occur when violence is passed from parent to child, or sibling to sibling.\n\nChildren exposed to domestic violence are likely to develop behavioral problems, such as regressing, exhibiting out of control behavior, and imitating behaviors. Children may think that violence is an acceptable behavior of intimate relationships and become either the abused or the abuser. Recent research has questioned whether certain effects of domestic violence exposure on children are moderated and/or mediated by maternal psychological response such as maternal post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociation, and related biological markers.\n\nAn estimated 1/5 to 1/3 of teenagers subject to viewing domestic violence situations experience teen dating violence, regularly abusing or being abused by their partners verbally, mentally, emotionally, sexually and/or physically. Thirty to 50% of dating relationships can exhibit the same cycle of escalating violence in their marital relationships.\n\nPhysical punishment of children has also been linked to later domestic violence. Family violence researcher Murray A. Straus believes that disciplinary spanking forms \"the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families\", whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later assaults on spouses.\n\nArab philosopher Ibn Khaldun in 1377 identified a cycle of violence in which successive dynasties take control of a state and establish asabiyyah or social cohesion, enabling them to expand to the limit. Excess 'pomp' causes the dynasty then to stagnate, become sedentary and collapse, giving way to conquest by a new, more ruthless dynasty. This cycle plays out over the course of three generations.\n\nAccording to John J. Mearsheimer the cycle of violence between nations will continue indefinitely because the Great powers fear each other, thus compete for power and dominance, in the belief that this will ensure safety.\n\n'Cycle of violence' is also used more generally to describe any long-term factional dispute within a nation in which tit-for-tat acts of aggression occur frequently, as for example in Argentina in the 1970s, in Lebanon and Israel.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25394665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25394665", "title": "Eco-costs value ratio", "text": "Eco-costs value ratio\n\nThe EVR model is a life cycle assessment based method to analyse consumption patterns, business strategies and design options in terms of eco-efficient value creation. Next to this it is used to compare products and service systems (e.g. benchmarking).\n\nThe eco-costs/value ratio (EVR) is an indicator to reveal sustainable and unsustainable consumption patterns of people. The eco-costs is an indicator for the environmental pollution of the products people buy, the value is the price they pay for it in our free market economy. Example: When somebody spends 1000 euro per month on housing (in Europe: EVR approx. 0,3) it is less harmful for the environment than when 1000 euro is spend on diesel (in Europe: EVR approx. 1,0). See section 3.1.\n\nThe EVR is also relevant for business strategies, because companies are facing the slow but inevitable internalization of environmental costs. At the moment the costs of products don't take into account the environmental damage caused by these products. This \"pollution is for free\" mentality is less and less accepted by communities.\n\nThe EVR makes companies aware of the relative importance of the environmental pollution of their products, and the relative risk they run that future production costs will increase because of this internalization of environmental costs. \nBy using the EVR, companies can make decisions for their product portfolio: abandon products with low value and high environmental costs and stimulate products with high value and low environmental costs. See sections 2.3 and 3.2.\n\nThe EVR model has been introduced in 1998 and published in 2000–2004 in the International Journal of LCA, and in the Journal of Cleaner Production. The concept of EVR is based on eco-costs. In 2007, 2012 and in 2017, the eco-costs system was updated. General databases of eco-costs are provided (open source) at www.ecocostsvalue.com of Delft University of Technology (the Netherlands). In 2010 a book named \"LCA-based assessment of sustainability: the Eco-costs/Value Ratio (EVR)\" was published containing the most important articles about the EVR.\n\nEVR = Eco-costs/value. The basic idea of the EVR model is to link the 'value chain' to the ecological product chain. In the value chain, the added value (in terms of money) and the added costs are determined for each step of the product 'from cradle to grave'. Similarly, the ecological impact of each step in the product chain is expressed in terms of money, the so-called 'eco-costs'. See Figure 1. Note that there exists also a Porter chain from the right to the left in Figure 1, starting with waste and adding value by recycling. In this way the Porter chain becomes circular.\n\nEco-costs express the amount of environmental burden of a product on basis of prevention of that burden. They are the marginal prevention costs (money) which should be made to reduce the environmental pollution and materials depletion in our world to a level which is in line with the carrying capacity of our earth.\n\nAs such, the eco-costs are virtual costs, since they are not yet integrated in the real life costs of current production chains (Life Cycle Costs). The eco-costs should be regarded as hidden obligations.\nFor example: for each 1000 kg emission, one should invest €135,- in offshore windmill parks (or other reduction systems at that price or less). When this is done consequently, the total emissions in the world will be reduced by 65% compared to the emissions in 2008. As a result global warming will stabilise. In short: \"the eco-costs of 1000kg are € 135,-\".\nSimilar calculations can be made on the environmental burden of acidification, eutrification, summer smog, fine dust, eco-toxicity, and the use of metals, fossil fuels and land (nature).\n\nEco-costs are used in Life Cycle Assessment, LCA, to assess the environmental performance of different materials, processes and End of Life methods.\n\nThe EVR combines eco-cost and value to see whether a product will be successful. The product should have low environmental impact in its lifecycle (low eco-costs) and an attractive value for consumers. The value here is the market value (perceived customer value, also called fair price). Figure 2 depicts the three dimensions of a product: the value, the costs and the eco-costs.\n\nIt is a trend in society that heavy pollution of industry is not accepted anymore by the inhabitants of a country. This results in stricter regulations by countries (e.g. tradable emission rights, enforcement of best available technologies, eco-taxes, etc.). Eco-costs will then become part of the internal production costs. This internalizing of eco-costs might be a threat to a company, but it might also be an opportunity: “When my product has less eco-burden than that of my competitor, my product can withstand stricter regulations of the government. So this characteristic of low eco-costs of my product is a competitive edge.” \nTo analyse the short term and the long term market prospects of a product or a product service combination (Product Service System, PSS), each product or PPS can be positioned in the portfolio matrix of Figure 3. The basic idea of the product portfolio matrix is the notion that a product, service or PSS is characterized by: \n\nIn terms of product strategy, the matrix results in 3 strategic directions:\n\n\nFor many 'green designs', the usual problem is that they have a low current value/costs ratio. In most of the cases the production costs are higher than the production costs of the classic solution, in some cases even the (perceived) quality is poor. There are two ways to do something about it:\n\na. enhance the (perceived) quality of the product\n\nb. attach to the product a service (create a PSS) in a way that the value of the bundle of the product and the service is more than the value of its components.\n\nFor a product which has a good present value/costs ratio, but high eco-costs, the product and the production process have to be redesigned to lower the eco-costs. This road towards sustainability is often far more promising than the strategy of enhancing the value/costs ratio of a green design. The reason is that the economies of scale for production and distribution are available and that the new product is marketed to an existing client base which is used to the brand name, the quality standards, the service system, etc.\n\nNote: The most common fear of business managers is that their new green products end up with a deteriorated value/costs ratio, and hence will have a cumbersome position in the market. The stability of the governmental policy plays an important role here. When governmental regulations which level the playing field are postponed or even abandoned, proactive companies with sound product strategies are harmed. This can cause severe damage to the transition process and may lead to reluctance of players to move proactively in the future.\nThe most successful design options are depicted in Figure 4. The best design strategy is: \n\nIn economics, de-linking (also known as decoupling) is often used in the context of economic production and environmental quality. In this context, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without corresponding increases in environmental pressure. In many economies increasing production (GDP) would involve increased pressure on the environment. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth, without also experiencing a worsening of environmental conditions, is said to be de-linked.\n\nThere is a consumer's side of the de-linking of economy and ecology. Under the assumption that most of the households spend in their life what they earn in their life, the total EVR of the spending of households is the key towards sustainability. Only when this total EVR of the spending gets lower, the eco-costs related to the total spending can be reduced even at a higher level of spending. There are two ways of achieving this: \n\nAt the production side, society is heading in the right direction: gradually, industrial production is achieving higher levels of the value/costs ratio and is at the same time becoming cleaner. At the consumer's side, however, society is suffering from the fact that the consumers preferences are heading in the wrong direction: towards products and services with an unfavourable EVR (like driving in SUVs, more kilometres, intercontinental flights for holidays). These unfavourable preferences can be concluded from Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5 shows that people in the Netherlands (and probably in the other EC countries as well) spend relatively more money on cars and holidays when they have more money available. Other studies show that people tend to have intercontinental holidays at the moment they can afford it. This shift in consumer spending will become a big problem in the near future, since the EVR of e.g. housing and health care is much lower than the EVR of transport and (inter)continental holidays by plane. \nFigure 6 shows the EVR (= ecocosts/price) on the Y/axis as a function of the cumulative expenditures of all products and services of all citizens in the EU 25 on the X-axis. The data is from the EIPRO study of the European Commission (EIPRO = environmental impact of products).\n\nThe area underneath the curve is proportional to the total eco-costs of the EU25. Basically there are two strategies to reduce the area under the curve: - ask industry to reduce the eco-costs of their products (this will shift the curve downward) - try to reduce expenditures of consumers in high end of the curve, and let them spend this money at the low end of the curve (this will shift the middle part of the curve to the right). \nThe question is now how designers and engineers can contribute to this required shift towards sustainability and what this means to product portfolio strategies of companies. The solution is Eco-efficient Value Creation.\n\nThe way towards sustainability requires a double aim in product innovation, see Figure 7: \n\nWe call this: eco-efficient value creation. \nThe reason we need value creation for eco-efficient products is threefold:\n\n\nBelow, an example of eco-efficient value creation is given, which is the introduction of the Lexus RX 400h in the USA: \n\nNote that the acceleration of a car is an interesting issue in terms of value. High acceleration is associated with expensive sports cars (Porsche, Ferrari). But people who buy these fast cars hardly use it. For these people acceleration is more part of the image of the product than it is part of the product qualities they use on a daily basis. So reducing the acceleration is the wrong strategy: it eliminates the extra value, and it hardly reduces the overall eco-costs in practice.\n\nLife cycle assessment (LCA) is the generally accepted method to compare two (or more) alternative products or services. A prerequisite for such a comparison is that the functionality ('functional unit') and the quality of the alternatives are the same (you cannot compare apples and oranges in the classical LCA). In cases of product design and architecture, however, this prerequisite seems to be a fundamental flaw in the application of LCA: the designer or architect is aiming at a better quality (in the broad sense of the word: including intangible aspects like beauty and image), so the new design never has the same quality. In some cases the functionality of the design is not the same, since the design solution is limited by a maximum budget, in some cases the functionality is the same, but the higher quality results in a higher price. In all these cases a single indicator in LCA (like the eco-costs) is not suitable for environmental benchmarking.\nIn these cases however, it does make sense to compare the design alternatives on the basis of the eco-costs/value ratio (EVR), where the value is the perceived customer value (the fair price). See section 3.1 on Delinking.\n\nExample 1. Different types of armchairs differ in terms of comfort, aesthetics, etc. rather than in terms of functionality. A classical LCA (with a single indicator like eco-costs, carbon footprint, etc.) does not make sense here. Selection on the basis of EVR, however, is the key to a sustainable consumption pattern. The chair with the lowest EVR is the best solution in terms of sustainability.\n\nExample 2. In LCA, the comparison of a new building and a renovated building is in the majority of cases not possible, since, in practice, both solutions differ in almost all quality aspects (tangible as well as intangible). However, the solution with lowest EVR is the best in terms of sustainable consumption.\n\nNote that the renovated building is the best solution in most of the cases, because it has the lowest EVR in the production phase. However, in some cases the renovated building is not the best solution, because of unfavourable energy consumption (high EVR) in the use phase.\n"}
{"id": "8834011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8834011", "title": "Existence precedes essence", "text": "Existence precedes essence\n\nThe proposition that existence precedes essence () is a central claim of existentialism, which reverses the traditional philosophical view that the essence (the nature) of a thing is more fundamental and immutable than its existence (the mere fact of its being). To existentialists, human beings—through their consciousness—create their own values and determine a meaning for their life because the human being does not possess any inherent identity or value. That identity or value must be created by the individual. By posing the acts that constitute them, they make their existence more significant.\n\nThe idea can be found in the works of philosopher Søren Kierkegaard in the 19th century, but was explicitly formulated by philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in the 20th century. The three-word formula originated in his 1945 lecture \"Existentialism Is a Humanism\", though antecedent notions can be found in Heidegger's \"Being and Time\".\n\nThe Sartrean claim is best understood in contrast to an established principle of metaphysics that \"essence\" precedes \"existence\", i.e. a typical claim for this traditional thesis would be that man is essentially selfish, or that he is a rational being.\n\nTo Sartre, \"existence precedes essence\" means that a personality is not built over a previously designed model or a precise purpose, because it is the human being who chooses to engage in such enterprise. While not denying the constraining conditions of human existence, he answers to Spinoza who affirmed that man is determined by what surrounds him. Therefore, to Sartre an oppressive situation is not intolerable in itself, but once regarded as such by those who feel oppressed the situation \"becomes\" intolerable. So by projecting my intentions onto my present condition, \"It is I who freely transform it into action\". When he said that \"the world is a mirror of my freedom\", he meant that the world obliged me to react, to overtake myself. It is this overtaking of a present constraining situation by a project to come that Sartre names transcendence. He added that \"we are condemned to be free\".\n\nWhen it is said that man defines himself, it is often perceived as stating that man can \"wish\" to be something – anything, a bird, for instance – and then be it. According to Sartre's account, however, this would be a kind of bad faith. What is meant by the statement is that man is (1) defined only insofar as he acts and (2) that he is responsible for his actions. To clarify, it can be said that a man who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel man and in that same instance, he (as opposed to his genes, for instance) is defined as being responsible for being this cruel man. Of course, the more positive therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: You can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person. Here it is also clear that since man can choose to be either cruel or good, he is, in fact, neither of these things \"essentially\".\n\nTo claim that existence precedes essence is to assert that there is no such predetermined essence to be found in humans, and that an individual's essence is defined by the individual through how that individual creates and lives his or her life. As Sartre puts it in his Existentialism is a Humanism: \"man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards\".\n\nExistentialism tends to focus on the question of human existence and the conditions of this existence. What is meant by existence is the concrete life of each individual, and their concrete ways of being in the world. Even though this concrete individual existence must be the primary source of information in the study of people, certain conditions are commonly held to be \"endemic\" to human existence. These conditions are usually in some way related to the inherent meaninglessness or absurdity of the earth and its apparent contrast with our pre-reflexive lived lives which normally present themselves to us as meaningful. A central theme is that since the world \"in-itself\" is absurd, that is, not \"fair\", then a meaningful life can at any point suddenly lose all its meaning. The reasons why this happens are many, ranging from a tragedy that \"tears a person's world apart\", to the results of an honest inquiry into one's own existence. Such an encounter can make a person mentally unstable, and avoiding such instability by making people aware of their condition and ready to handle it is one of the central themes of existentialism. Albert Camus, for instance, famously claimed in \"Le Mythe de Sisyphe\" that \"there is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide\".\n\nAside from these \"psychological\" issues, it is also claimed that these encounters with the absurd are where we are most in touch with our condition as humans. Such an encounter cannot be without philosophical significance, and existentialist philosophers derive many metaphysical theories from these encounters. These are often related to the self, consciousness and freedom as well as the nature of meaning.\n\n\n\n"}

In the Theravada tradition, these factors are identified specifically as obstacles to the jhānas (stages of concentration) within meditation practice. Within the Mahayana tradition, the five hindrances are identified as obstacles to samatha (tranquility) meditation. Contemporary Insight Meditation teachers identify the five hindrances as obstacles to mindfulness meditation.\n\nThe five hindrances are:\n\nThe five hindrances are identified in the major Buddhist traditions of Theravada Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism, as well in the contemporary Insight Meditation tradition. But the hindrances are presented differently within these different traditions, depending upon the way each tradition teaches the practice of meditation.\n\nContemporary Insight Meditation teacher Gil Fronsdal describes the hindrances as \"a very important list of mental states that have a big impact on meditation practice and people’s daily lives.\" Fronsdal emphasizes that it is important not to see the hindrances as personal failings. All human beings have them. A big part of mindfulness meditation is to learn about these hindrances in order to become free of them. Therefore, Fronsdal states, the goal is to not dismiss them, but to study them and understand them really well.\n\nContemporary teacher Jack Kornfield described the five hindrances as \"difficult energies which arise in the mind and in one's life as a part of meditation practice.\"\n\nContemporary Theravada scholar Nina van Gorkom states: \"The hindrances are obstructions, overwhelming the mind, weakening insight.[...] The hindrances obstruct the development of what is wholesome.\"\n\nWithin the Theravada tradition, the five hindrances are identified specifically as obstacles to the jhānas (stages of concentration) within meditation. For example, contemporary Theravada teacher Ajahn Brahmavamso states:\n\nAjahn Brahmavamso emphasizes that any obstacle that arises in meditation can be identified as one of the five hindrances; he states:\n\nWithin the Mahayana tradition, the five hindrances are typically identified as obstacles to samatha meditation (also referred to as tranquility meditation).\n\nAll of the Buddhist traditions emphasize that the hindrances are overcome by investigating and understanding them. For example, contemporary Theravada teacher Ajahn Sumedho states:\n\nContemporary Insight Meditation teacher Gil Fronsdal emphasizes that to be a good student of the hindrances, you must be very patient with them and not be dismissive of them. When they arise, you must stop for them. Fronsdal states that a bumper sticker for this type of training could be “I stop for the hindrances.” You don’t indulge them, Fronsdal states, you become interested and study them.\n\nThe Insight Meditation tradition teaches the RAIN formula for investigating the hindrances:\n\n\nThe hindrance of sensory desire (\"kamacchanda\") is latching onto thoughts or feelings based on the pleasures of the five senses.\n\nThe hindrance of sensory desire is compared to taking out a loan – any pleasure one experiences through these five senses must be repaid through the unpleasantness of separation or loss which invariably follow when the pleasure is used up. There is also interest to be repaid on the loan. Thus, the Buddha said that the pleasure is small compared to the suffering repaid.\n\nIn order to overcome the hindrance of sensory desire (\"kamacchanda\"), the meditator must first apply mindfulness and recognize that the hindrance is present. Then one must look at the hindrance, analyze it, make it the object of our meditation, experience it fully. The meditator can then apply specific techniques such as contemplating the impermanence of the pleasant desire.\nAjahn Brahmavamso emphasizes the technique of letting go of concern for the body and the five senses completely; he states:\n\nKamacchanda can be compared to giving your approval for \"kāma\"-based thoughts and emotions to remain in your mind. It is allowing these thoughts to occupy your mind. Ajahn Brahmavamso explains:\n\nThe hindrance of ill will (\"vyapada\") is latching onto thoughts or feelings based on anger, resentment, hostility, bitterness, etc.\n\nThe hindrance of ill will is compared to being sick. Just as sickness denies one the freedom and happiness of health, so ill will denies one the freedom and happiness of peace.\n\nThe antidote to the hindrance of ill will (\"vyapada\") is meditation on loving kindness (metta). Ajahn Brahmavamso states:\n\nSloth-torpor is a dull, morbid state that is characterized by unwieldiness, lack of energy, and opposition to wholesome activity.\n\n\nThe hindrance of sloth-torpor is compared to being imprisoned in a cramped, dark cell, unable to move freely in the bright sunshine outside.\n\nAjahn Brahmavamso states:\n\nTraleg Kyabgon states: \"When this happens, instead of persisting with the meditation, it is better to try to refresh ourselves by getting up and going for a walk or washing our face, after which we return to our meditation.\"\n\nThe hindrance of restlessness-worry (\"uddhacca-kukkucca\") refers to a mind that is agitated and unable to settle down.\n\n\nRestlessness (\"uddhacca\") is compared to being a slave, continually having to jump to the orders of a tyrannical boss who always demands perfection and so never lets one stop.\n\n\nThe hindrance of doubt (\"vicikicchā\") refers to doubt about one's ability to understand and implement the meditation instructions, as well as about the teacher and Buddhist teachings in general.\n\n\nDoubt is compared to being lost in a desert, not recognising any landmarks.\n\nAjahn Brahmavamso states:\n\nB. Alan Wallace identifies five mental factors that counteract the five hindrances, according to the Theravada tradition:\n\nThese five counteracting factors arise during the first jhāna (stage of concentration).\n\nIn the Pali Canon's Samyutta Nikaya, several discourses juxtapose the five hindrances with the seven factors of enlightenment (\"bojjhanga\"). For instance, according to SN 46.37, the Buddha stated:\n\nIn terms of gaining insight into and overcoming the Five Hindrances, according to the Satipatthana Sutta, the Buddha proclaimed:\n\nEach of the remaining four hindrances are similarly treated in subsequent paragraphs.\n\nThe Buddha gives the following analogies in the \"Samaññaphala Sutta\" (DN 2, \"The Fruits of the Contemplative Life\"): \n\nSimilarly, in the \"Sagārava Sutta\" (SN 46.55), the Buddha compares sensual desire with looking for a clear reflection in water mixed with lac, turmeric and dyes; ill will with boiling water; sloth-and-torpor with water covered with plants and algae; restlessness-and-worry with wind-churned water; and, doubt with water that is \"turbid, unsettled, muddy, placed in the dark.\"\n\nAccording to the first-century CE exegetic \"Vimuttimagga\", the five hindrances include all ten \"fetters\": sense desire includes any attachment to passion; ill will includes all unwholesome states of hatred; and, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt include all unwholesome states of infatuation. The Vimuttimagga further distinguishes that \"sloth\" refers to mental states while \"torpor\" refers to physical states resultant from food or time or mental states; if torpor results from food or time, then one diminishes it through energy; otherwise, one removes it with meditation. In addition, the Vimuttimagga identifies four types of doubt: \n\nAccording to Buddhaghosa's fifth-century CE commentary to the Samyutta Nikaya (\"\"), one can momentarily escape the hindrances through jhanic suppression or through insight while, as also stated in the \"Vimuttimagga\", one eradicates the hindrances through attainment of one of the four stages of enlightenment (see Table 1).\n\nAccording to Gil Fronsdal, the Pali term \"nīvaraṇa\" means covering. Fronsdal states that these hindrances cover over: the clarity of our mind, and our ability to be mindful, wise, concentrated, and stay on purpose.\n\nAccording to Rhys Davids, the Pali term \"nīvaraṇa\" (Sanskrit: \"nivāraṇa\") refers to an obstacle or hindrance only in the ethical sense, and is usually enumerated in a set of five.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19468696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19468696", "title": "Fundamental theorem of calculus", "text": "Fundamental theorem of calculus\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus is a theorem that links the concept of differentiating a function with the concept of integrating a function. \n\nThe first part of the theorem, sometimes called the first fundamental theorem of calculus, states that one of the antiderivatives (also called \"indefinite integral\"), say \"F\", of some function \"f\" may be obtained as the integral of \"f\" with a variable bound of integration. This implies the existence of antiderivatives for continuous functions.\n\nConversely, the second part of the theorem, sometimes called the second fundamental theorem of calculus, states that the integral of a function \"f\" over some interval can be computed by using any one, say \"F\", of its infinitely many antiderivatives. This part of the theorem has key practical applications, because explicitly finding the antiderivative of a function by symbolic integration avoids numerical integration to compute integrals. This provides generally a better numerical accuracy.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus relates differentiation and integration, showing that these two operations are essentially inverses of one another. Before the discovery of this theorem, it was not recognized that these two operations were related. Ancient Greek mathematicians knew how to compute area via infinitesimals, an operation that we would now call integration. The origins of differentiation likewise predate the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus by hundreds of years; for example, in the fourteenth century the notions of \"continuity\" of functions and \"motion\" were studied by the Oxford Calculators and other scholars. The historical relevance of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is not the ability to calculate these operations, but the realization that the two seemingly distinct operations (calculation of geometric areas, and calculation of velocities) are actually closely related.\n\nThe first published statement and proof of a rudimentary form of the fundamental theorem, strongly geometric in character, was by James Gregory (1638–1675). Isaac Barrow (1630–1677) proved a more generalized version of the theorem, while his student Isaac Newton (1642–1727) completed the development of the surrounding mathematical theory. Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) systematized the knowledge into a calculus for infinitesimal quantities and introduced the notation used today.\n\nFor a continuous function whose graph is plotted as a curve, each value of \"x\" has a corresponding area function \"A\"(\"x\"), representing the area beneath the curve between 0 and \"x\". The function \"A\"(\"x\") may not be known, but it is given that it represents the area under the curve.\n\nThe area under the curve between \"x\" and could be computed by finding the area between 0 and then subtracting the area between 0 and \"x\". In other words, the area of this “strip” would be .\n\nThere is another way to \"estimate\" the area of this same strip. As shown in the accompanying figure, \"h\" is multiplied by \"f\"(\"x\") to find the area of a rectangle that is approximately the same size as this strip. So:\n\nIn fact, this estimate becomes a perfect equality if we add the red portion of the \"excess\" area shown in the diagram. So:\n\nRearranging terms:\n\nAs \"h\" approaches 0 in the limit, the last fraction can be shown to go to zero. This is true because the area of the red portion of excess region is less than or equal to the area of the tiny black-bordered rectangle. More precisely,\nwhere formula_5 and formula_6 are points where reaches its maximum and its minimum, respectively, in the interval .\nBy the continuity of , the latter expression tends to zero as does. Therefore, the left-hand side tends to zero as does, which implies\nThis implies . That is, the derivative of the area function \"A\"(\"x\") exists and is the original function \"f\"(\"x\"); so, the area function is simply an antiderivative of the original function. Computing the derivative of a function and “finding the area” under its curve are \"opposite\" operations. This is the crux of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\nIntuitively, the theorem simply states that the sum of infinitesimal changes in a quantity over time (or over some other variable) adds up to the net change in the quantity.\n\nImagine for example using a stopwatch to mark-off tiny increments of time as a car travels down a highway. Imagine also looking at the car's speedometer as it travels, so that at every moment you know the velocity of the car. To understand the power of this theorem, imagine also that you are not allowed to look out the window of the car, so that you have no direct evidence of how far the car has traveled.\n\nFor any tiny interval of time in the car, you could calculate how far the car has traveled in that interval by multiplying the current speed of the car times the length of that tiny interval of time. (This is because \"distance\" = \"speed\" formula_8 \"time\".)\n\nNow imagine doing this instant after instant, so that for every tiny interval of time you know how far the car has traveled. In principle, you could then calculate the \"total\" distance traveled in the car (even though you've never looked out the window) by simply summing-up all those tiny distances.\n\nIn other words,\n\nOn the right hand side of this equation, as formula_12 becomes infinitesimally small, the operation of \"summing up\" corresponds to integration. So what we've shown is that the integral of the velocity function can be used to compute how far the car has traveled.\n\nNow remember that the velocity function is simply the derivative of the position function. So what we have really shown is that integrating the velocity simply recovers the original position function. This is the basic idea of the theorem: that \"integration\" and \"differentiation\" are closely related operations, each essentially being the inverse of the other.\n\nIn other words, in terms of one's physical intuition, the theorem simply states that the sum of the changes in a quantity over time (such as \"position\", as calculated by multiplying \"velocity\" times \"time\") adds up to the total net change in the quantity. Or to put this more generally:\nthen the idea that \"distance equals speed times time\" corresponds to the statement\nmeaning that one can recover the original function formula_17 by integrating its derivative, the velocity formula_15, over formula_14.\n\nThere are two parts to the theorem. The first part deals with the derivative of an antiderivative, while the second part deals with the relationship between antiderivatives and definite integrals.\n\nThis part is sometimes referred to as the \"first fundamental theorem of calculus\".\n\nLet \"f\" be a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed interval [\"a\", \"b\"]. Let \"F\" be the function defined, for all \"x\" in [\"a\", \"b\"], by\n\nThen, \"F\" is uniformly continuous on [\"a\", \"b\"], differentiable on the open interval and\n\nfor all \"x\" in (\"a\", \"b\").\n\nThe fundamental theorem is often employed to compute the definite integral of a function formula_22 for which an antiderivative formula_23 is known. Specifically, if formula_22 is a real-valued continuous function on formula_25 and formula_23 is an antiderivative of formula_22 in formula_25 then\n\nThe corollary assumes continuity on the whole interval. This result is strengthened slightly in the following part of the theorem.\n\nThis part is sometimes referred to as the second fundamental theorem of calculus or the Newton–Leibniz axiom.\n\nLet formula_22 be a real-valued function on a closed interval formula_25 and formula_23 an antiderivative of formula_22 in formula_25:\n\nIf formula_22 is Riemann integrable on formula_25 then\n\nThe second part is somewhat stronger than the corollary because it does not assume that formula_22 is continuous.\n\nWhen an antiderivative formula_23 exists, then there are infinitely many antiderivatives for formula_22, obtained by adding an arbitrary constant to formula_23. Also, by the first part of the theorem, antiderivatives of formula_22 always exist when formula_22 is continuous.\n\nFor a given \"f\"(\"t\"), define the function \"F\"(\"x\") as\n\nFor any two numbers \"x\" and \"x\" + Δ\"x\" in [\"a\", \"b\"], we have\nand\n\nSubtracting the two equalities gives\n\nIt can be shown that\nManipulating this equation gives\n\nSubstituting the above into (1) results in\n\nAccording to the mean value theorem for integration, there exists a real number formula_52 such that\n\nTo keep the notation simple, we write just formula_54, but one should keep in mind that, for a given function formula_22, the value of formula_54 depends on formula_57 and on formula_58 but is always confined to the interval formula_59.\nSubstituting the above into (2) we get\n\nDividing both sides by formula_61 gives\n\nTake the limit as formula_61 → 0 on both sides of the equation.\n\nThe expression on the left side of the equation is the definition of the derivative of \"F\" at \"x\".\n\nTo find the other limit, we use the squeeze theorem. The number \"c\" is in the interval [\"x\", \"x\" + Δ\"x\"], so \"x\" ≤ \"c\" ≤ \"x\" + Δ\"x\".\n\nAlso, formula_66 and formula_67\n\nTherefore, according to the squeeze theorem,\n\nSubstituting into (3), we get\n\nThe function \"f\" is continuous at \"c\", so the limit can be taken inside the function. Therefore, we get\nwhich completes the proof.\n\nSuppose \"F\" is an antiderivative of \"f\", with \"f\" continuous on Let\n\nBy the \"first part\" of the theorem, we know \"G\" is also an antiderivative of \"f\". Since \"F' - G' = 0\" the mean value theorem implies that \"F - G\" is a constant function, i. e. there is a number \"c\" such that , for all \"x\" in Letting , we have\n\nwhich means In other words, , and so\n\nThis is a limit proof by Riemann sums.\nLet \"f\" be (Riemann) integrable on the interval and let \"f\" admit an antiderivative \"F\" on Begin with the quantity . Let there be numbers \"x\", ..., \"x\"\nsuch that\n\nIt follows that\n\nNow, we add each \"F\"(\"x\") along with its additive inverse, so that the resulting quantity is equal:\n\nThe above quantity can be written as the following sum:\n\nNext, we employ the mean value theorem. Stated briefly,\n\nLet \"F\" be continuous on the closed interval [\"a\", \"b\"] and differentiable on the open interval (\"a\", \"b\"). Then there exists some \"c\" in (\"a\", \"b\") such that\n\nIt follows that\n\nThe function \"F\" is differentiable on the interval therefore, it is also differentiable and continuous on each interval . According to the mean value theorem (above),\n\nSubstituting the above into (1), we get\n\nThe assumption implies formula_82 Also, formula_83 can be expressed as formula_61 of partition formula_85.\n\nWe are describing the area of a rectangle, with the width times the height, and we are adding the areas together. Each rectangle, by virtue of the mean value theorem, describes an approximation of the curve section it is drawn over. Also formula_87 need not be the same for all values of \"i\", or in other words that the width of the rectangles can differ. What we have to do is approximate the curve with \"n\" rectangles. Now, as the size of the partitions get smaller and \"n\" increases, resulting in more partitions to cover the space, we get closer and closer to the actual area of the curve.\n\nBy taking the limit of the expression as the norm of the partitions approaches zero, we arrive at the Riemann integral. We know that this limit exists because \"f\" was assumed to be integrable. That is, we take the limit as the largest of the partitions approaches zero in size, so that all other partitions are smaller and the number of partitions approaches infinity.\n\nSo, we take the limit on both sides of (2). This gives us\n\nNeither \"F\"(\"b\") nor \"F\"(\"a\") is dependent on formula_89, so the limit on the left side remains \n\nThe expression on the right side of the equation defines the integral over \"f\" from \"a\" to \"b\". Therefore, we obtain\n\nwhich completes the proof.\n\nIt almost looks like the first part of the theorem follows directly from the second. That is, suppose \"G\" is an antiderivative of \"f\". Then by the second theorem, formula_92. Now, suppose formula_93. Then \"F\" has the same derivative as \"G\", and therefore . This argument only works, however, if we already know that \"f\" has an antiderivative, and the only way we know that all continuous functions have antiderivatives is by the first part of the Fundamental Theorem.\nFor example, if then \"f\" has an antiderivative, namely\n\nand there is no simpler expression for this function. It is therefore important not to interpret the second part of the theorem as the definition of the integral. Indeed, there are many functions that are integrable but lack elementary antiderivatives, and discontinuous functions can be integrable but lack any antiderivatives at all. Conversely, many functions that have antiderivatives are not Riemann integrable (see Volterra's function).\n\nAs an example, suppose the following is to be calculated:\n\nHere, formula_96 and we can use formula_97 as the antiderivative. Therefore:\n\nOr, more generally, suppose that\n\nis to be calculated. Here, formula_100 and formula_101 can be used as the antiderivative. Therefore:\n\nOr, equivalently,\n\nAs a theoretical example, the theorem can be used to prove that\n\nSince, \n\nthe result follows from, \n\nWe don't need to assume continuity of \"f\" on the whole interval. Part I of the theorem then says: if \"f\" is any Lebesgue integrable function on and \"x\" is a number in such that \"f\" is continuous at \"x\", then\n\nis differentiable for with We can relax the conditions on \"f\" still further and suppose that it is merely locally integrable. In that case, we can conclude that the function \"F\" is differentiable almost everywhere and almost everywhere. On the real line this statement is equivalent to Lebesgue's differentiation theorem. These results remain true for the Henstock–Kurzweil integral, which allows a larger class of integrable functions .\n\nIn higher dimensions Lebesgue's differentiation theorem generalizes the Fundamental theorem of calculus by stating that for almost every \"x\", the average value of a function \"f\" over a ball of radius \"r\" centered at \"x\" tends to \"f\"(\"x\") as \"r\" tends to 0.\n\nPart II of the theorem is true for any Lebesgue integrable function \"f\", which has an antiderivative \"F\" (not all integrable functions do, though). In other words, if a real function \"F\" on admits a derivative \"f\"(\"x\") at \"every\" point \"x\" of and if this derivative \"f\" is Lebesgue integrable on then\n\nThis result may fail for continuous functions \"F\" that admit a derivative \"f\"(\"x\") at almost every point \"x\", as the example of the Cantor function shows. However, if \"F\" is absolutely continuous, it admits a derivative \"F′\"(\"x\") at almost every point \"x\", and moreover \"F′\" is integrable, with equal to the integral of \"F′\" on Conversely, if \"f\" is any integrable function, then \"F\" as given in the first formula will be absolutely continuous with \"F′\" = \"f\" a.e.\n\nThe conditions of this theorem may again be relaxed by considering the integrals involved as Henstock–Kurzweil integrals. Specifically, if a continuous function \"F\"(\"x\") admits a derivative \"f\"(\"x\") at all but countably many points, then \"f\"(\"x\") is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable and is equal to the integral of \"f\" on The difference here is that the integrability of \"f\" does not need to be assumed. \n\nThe version of Taylor's theorem, which expresses the error term as an integral, can be seen as a generalization of the fundamental theorem.\n\nThere is a version of the theorem for complex functions: suppose \"U\" is an open set in C and is a function that has a holomorphic antiderivative \"F\" on \"U\". Then for every curve the curve integral can be computed as\n\nThe fundamental theorem can be generalized to curve and surface integrals in higher dimensions and on manifolds. One such generalization offered by the calculus of moving surfaces is the time evolution of integrals. The most familiar extensions of the fundamental theorem of calculus in higher dimensions are the divergence theorem and the gradient theorem.\n\nOne of the most powerful generalizations in this direction is Stokes' theorem (sometimes known as the fundamental theorem of multivariable calculus): Let \"M\" be an oriented piecewise smooth manifold of dimension \"n\" and let formula_110 be a smooth compactly supported (\"n\"–1)-form on \"M\". If ∂\"M\" denotes the boundary of \"M\" given its induced orientation, then\n\nHere \"d\" is the exterior derivative, which is defined using the manifold structure only.\n\nThe theorem is often used in situations where \"M\" is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold (e.g. R\"\") on which the form formula_110 is defined.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37217532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37217532", "title": "Gender and security sector reform", "text": "Gender and security sector reform\n\nGender and security sector reform is an emerging subfield of security sector reform (SSR) that is both practical and conceptual. SSR generally is a comprehensive framework within which all or part of a state's security sector undergoes a process of transformation in order to bring it more into line with principles such as democratic oversight, good governance and the rule of law. The overall objectives of SSR programmes – as defined both by the state in question and any international donors supporting the process – tend to include improving service delivery, enhancing local ownership and ensuring the sustainability of security sector institutions. As gender-specific approaches take into account the specific needs of men, women, boys and girls through gender mainstreaming and by promoting the equal participation of people of all genders in decision-making processes, states and international organisations increasingly consider them to be a necessary component of SSR programmes.\n\nThe need to integrate gender into SSR processes was recognised at the international level in 2008 by then-United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his report on SSR, where he stated that: \"...the integration of a gender perspective in security sector reform is inherent to an inclusive and socially responsive approach to security. Gender-sensitive security sector reform\", he went on, \"is key to developing security sector institutions that are non-discriminatory, representative of the population and capable of effectively responding to the specific security needs of diverse groups.\" Since the release of this report, the number of SSR programmes incorporating a gender dimension has increased dramatically, as has the amount of academic literature available and the number of specialists working in the area. Gender dimensions are often included in SSR processes as part of a country's commitment to UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) (UNSCR 1325), which calls for wider female participation in all aspects of post-conflict reconstruction and for more consideration of the specific needs of women and girls. For example, Liberia's National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 makes provisions for strengthening the capacity of the SSR desk at the Ministry for Gender and Development.\n\nIn 2012, a decade after UNSCR 1325 began to be implemented, the Security Council highlighted \"the importance of addressing sexual violence in armed conflict and post-conflict situations in the context of security sector reform initiatives and arrangements, including training, vetting, and capacity-building of national security actors.\" In addition, a US representative on the Security Council noted that the \"integration of a gender perspective made institutions more inclusive and improved the overall effectiveness of security sector reform.\"\n\nOne of the key tenets of SSR is that the security sector should be designed to serve the security and justice needs of the population. A person's gender (along with other characteristics, such as age, class, ethnicity/clan/tribe/caste, and sexual orientation) plays an important part in his or her own security needs. Worldwide, women, men, girls and boys have different experiences in areas such as sexual violence, trafficking in human beings, gang violence, robbery, dowry deaths, abduction and so-called 'honour killings'. For example, over 90 percent of deaths related to firearms are male, whereas in most countries, the proportion of women with male intimate partners who experience physical violence during the course of their relationship lies between one-quarter and one-half. Around the world, women, men, girls and boys also have different access to resources such as land, money, education, healthcare and political power. Women own less than 15 percent of land worldwide and only 2 percent in the developing world.\n\nFor this reason, gender perspectives are a useful tool to achieving the security sector's objectives. For example, in order to encourage women who have been victims of SGBV to report the crime, it may be important to give them the option of speaking to a woman police officer, perhaps in a specialized police station. In cases where men are affected by SGBV, similar provisions may also be needed, as well as training for security sector personnel who may not be aware of the existence and extent of gender-based violence committed against men. In both cases, an effective response will usually also involve public awareness campaigns highlighting the problem and the services available to survivors. It will probably also include forming partnerships between security providers (e.g. police, justice institutions and prisons), health care providers and civil society organisations, as part of a holistic approach to SSR.\n\nMore broadly, collaboration between security sector institutions and civil society groups involved in gender issues can increase the effectiveness of the security sector. Such groups can deliver training, support policy development, and on an ongoing basis provide complementary security and justice services and keep security forces informed about issues within communities.\n\nA further gendered aspect of effective service delivery centres around the skills of security sector personnel themselves. Other societal factors tend to result in men and women having different skill sets. Consequently, if security sector institutions lack either male and female staff at any level, their staff will possess a smaller skill set, limiting their operational options. For example, studies in the USA found that American female police officers were more adept at policing without the use of excessive or deadly force than their male counterparts, although they were as likely to use force as men when absolutely necessary. As a result, male police officers cost US taxpayers between 2.5 and 5.5 times more in legal fees related to excessive force liability lawsuit payouts and are almost three times more likely to be threatened or attacked by citizens. Despite the proven ability of women to increase the skill set of police forces, the closest any police force has come to achieving gender balance is Estonia, where 33.5% of officers are female.\n\nFourthly, certain security roles might for cultural reasons only be able to be performed by personnel of a particular gender, requiring both male and female personnel for effective operations. For example, in many cultures it is inappropriate for a male police officer or soldier to search a woman. Likewise, in intelligence-gathering, civilians may only be willing to speak with security sector personnel of a certain gender.\n\nLocal ownership has been recognised as a key pillar in ensuring that SSR is both implemented correctly and sustainable. Local ownership of SSR is characterised by \"the reform of security policies, institutions and activities in a given country must be designed, managed and implemented by local actors rather than external actors\" and is notably distinct from local support for donor programmes and projects. Given that security and justice needs vary by gender, it is important to ensure that people of different genders are consulted and involved in an SSR process. In practice, this can be achieved by involving women's groups, youth groups and other organisations that work on gender-related security issues such as human trafficking, gang violence and human rights. Such groups can serve as a crucial bridge between local communities and SSR policymakers, strengthening local ownership through communicating security and justice needs to policymakers and raising awareness of SSR in local communities.\n\nImproving oversight and accountability of the security sector can ensure the sustainability of SSR by building trust among the population and by deterring security sector personnel from abusing their power. To be effective, it is essential that security sector oversight bodies and accountability mechanisms (parliaments, national human rights institutions, complaints bodies, local security fora etc.) adopt a gendered perspective. This involves both giving particular attention to the different types of violations committed by security sector personnel against people of different genders, and monitoring the quality of services delivered to people of different genders. Involving gender experts, women's groups and other civil society organisations that work on gender issues in oversight bodies and accountability processes is helpful.\n\nGender and SSR at both national and international levels takes place within a well-elaborated legal framework.\n\nCEDAW holds states responsible for ending discrimination against women, which it defines in Article 1 as \"any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.\" States parties agree to do this using measures such as reviewing their national legislation to remove discriminatory laws and to criminalize discrimination against women, creating national tribunals or institutions to eliminate discrimination or by implementing policies.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action resulted from the Fourth World Conference on Women and aimed to promote the advancement and empowerment of women. Areas related to SSR include calls on governments to ensure access to free or low-cost legal services, to aim for gender balance in nominations to international, judicial and governmental bodies and to develop comprehensive human rights education programmes for the public, public officials (notably within the police, military, prison system, government, judiciary and all those working in positions related to migration).\n\nUNSCR 1325 was a landmark resolution in that it recognised the disproportionate impact of armed conflict on civilian women and children, whether they are targeted (e.g. rape as an instrument of war) or indirectly affected (e.g. forced migration). It also recognised contributions women make to conflict prevention, resolution and post-conflict reconstruction and called for greater inclusion of women in processes related to peace and security. It mandated a policy of gender mainstreaming in all UN peacekeeping operations, which often include support to SSR processes.\n\nUNSCR 1820 sought to address the issue of sexual violence against women and girls during conflict by explicitly mandating the participation of women in \"all disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration processes, and in justice and security sector reform efforts assisted by the United Nations\".\n\nUNSCR 1888 builds on 1820 by mandating that sexual violence also be addressed in peace processes and calls for the deployment of experts and a Special Representative of Sexual Violence in Conflict. UNSCR 1889 calls for an increased role for women at the top levels of mediation as well as mandating the UN to collect gender-segregated data on all activities related to peace and security.\n\nUNSCR 1960 encourages the inclusion of women in police, civil and military functions during peacekeeping missions.\n\nUNSCR 2106 requests relevant UN entities to assist national authorities in addressing sexual violence, with effective participation of women, in SSR and justice sector reform processes, specifically through training, increasing female recruitment and implementing vetting processes that exclude perpetrators of sexual violence from serving in security institutions.\n\nThe following two complementary strategies can be used to integrate gender issues into SSR policy and programming:\n\nGender mainstreaming is \"the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve gender equality.\" In the context of SSR, gender mainstreaming involves considering the impact all aspects of the programme at all stages of the programming cycle in light of the different security needs of women, men, boys and girls. To achieve this, all data collected should be gender disaggregated. It may result in gender initiatives – such as gender training for security sector personnel and gender budget analysis to ensure that resources are being distributed equally: It may also result in initiatives aimed at men, women, boys or girls – such as mentoring schemes to facilitate the professional development of female police officers, providing access to justice for male civilian victims of wartime sex-selective massacres, policy measures to prevent the enslavement of boys and ensuring the inclusion of former female child soldiers in disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programmes.\n\nSometimes known as gender balance, promoting the equal participation of men and women in SSR processes and security sector institutions is a method of strengthening local ownership as well as increasing representation and effectiveness. In relation to SSR processes, this may involve ensuring that women and men are equally involved in SSR needs assessment, monitoring and evaluation, and that representatives of women (such as from the ministry responsible for women, or from civil society) participate in SSR policy- and decision-making. In relation to security sector institutions, because men are over-represented, promoting equal participation generally involves increasing the recruitment, retention and advancement of women. Doing so may require developing policies for security sector institutions that allow personnel to perform socially-expected gender roles (e.g. flexible working hours for parents. Some countries have attempted to promote equal participation by introducing gender quotas. In the Liberian National Police, for example, a quota that at least 20% of new recruits must be women succeeded in rapidly increasing female participation.\n\nWhile all gender and SSR processes share many overarching objectives, the kinds of activities carried out on the ground will vary significantly depending upon the context in which they take place.\n\nThe focus of many gender and SSR efforts in post-conflict settings is on stemming heightened levels of SGBV, particularly against women and children, that tend to persist due to high levels of available weapons, trauma and a lack of economic opportunities for former-combatants and young adults (especially men) who feel marginalised. Men, women, girls and boys all have important roles to play in re-establishing civil society. However, as there is often pressure to rebuild security sector institutions as quickly as possible and as male-dominated, militarised command structures may still be in political control of the state, the different needs of the population are often overlooked. Challenges in these settings frequently include integrating gender issues in DDR processes, recruiting more women into newly reconstructed security sector institutions, ensuring access to transitional justice mechanisms for victims of SGBV during the conflict and ensuring that the newly reformed justice institutions take into account the needs of those most at risk from the heightened levels of post-conflict SGBV. However, it should also be emphasised that SSR can be an entry point in post-conflict contexts for overcoming pre-conflict gender-based inequality and insecurity.\n\nTransitional countries refer to post-authoritarian contexts which may or may not be accompanied be changes in economic system. They tend to have well-funded and oversized security institutions that are undergoing a shift from serving a regime to serving the population. As such, developing and implementing new working practices whereby the primary objective is to respond to the different security needs of the population may present a challenge for personnel who are used to maintaining order through violent means. In former Eastern Bloc transitional countries, civil society may be weak but in other contexts such as in countries affected by the Arab Spring, civil society may have organised into a broad coalition in order to bring about political change with women's groups playing a leading role. There often is a window of opportunity for civil society to reshape security sector institutions by, for example, integrating gender perspectives. This may also be incentivised by new possibilities for regional cooperation which involve adhering to gender-related minimum standards.\n\nThere is increasing opinion that gender-based violence and discrimination inhibit development as, aside from their negative social and personal consequences, they impair the productivity of those affected to the detriment of the whole economy. Gender-based violence and discrimination also increases the risk of violent conflict breaking out as it can be used as an instrument of warfare to destabilise communities, can inhibit certain groups from participating in post-conflict peacebuilding activities as well as perpetuating an atmosphere of impunity regarding violence in the society. For this reason, gender and SSR is increasingly being implemented by the governments of developing countries with the support of donors and other actors in the international community, who may make the integration of gender a condition for development support. Translating policy into practice is often hindered by the lack of human and financial resources in developing counties. However, civil society organisations are widespread and well-organised in many developing countries providing competent partners for governments and donors in implementing gender and SSR initiatives.\n\nThe term SSR is usually used to refer to processes in post-conflict and transitional countries, where there is often support by third countries and/or international organisations. However, developed countries also engage in SSR activities. Gender and SSR-related activities include efforts to increase the recruitment, retention and advancement of female security sector personnel, improving responses to SGBV, training on how to prevent and respond to SGBV during overseas deployments, strengthening the gender dimensions of oversight and monitoring, and building collaboration with civil society groups concerned with gender issues. The challenges for integrating gender in such contexts tend to revolve around complacency and the emphasis on external threats such as terrorism. Entry points for gender and SSR are often linked to legal obligations under anti-discrimination and human rights legislation, or the need to boost recruitment for operational reasons. For example, following the introduction of the Canadian Human Rights Act (1977), the Canadian Forces were obliged to prove that any discriminatory policies were an operational necessity. After consistently failing to do so in court, the systemic barriers to women's participation in all areas of activity had been lifted by 2001. Social pressure also forced the Canadian Forces to address attitudinal causes of discrimination and SGBV through the establishment of Defense Diversity Councils. Similarly, regional frameworks such as NATO and the Council of Europe can provide impetus and a degree of social pressure for gender and SSR activities in developing countries.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1373047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1373047", "title": "History of the Jews under Muslim rule", "text": "History of the Jews under Muslim rule\n\nJewish communities have existed across the Middle East and North Africa since Antiquity. By the time of the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, these ancient communities had been ruled by various empires and included the Babylonian, Persian, Carthaginian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Yemenite Jews.\n\nJews under Islamic rule were given the status of dhimmi, along with certain other pre-Islamic religious groups. Though second-class citizens, these non-Muslim groups were nevertheless accorded certain rights and protections as \"people of the book\". During waves of persecution in Medieval Europe, many Jews found refuge in Muslim lands. For instance, Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula were invited to settle in various parts of the Ottoman Empire, where they would often form a prosperous model minority of merchants acting as intermediaries for their Muslim rulers.\n\nToday, Jews residing in Muslim countries have been reduced to a small fraction of their former sizes, with Iran and Turkey being home to the largest remaining Jewish populations.\n\nThere were, for a long but uncertain period, a significant number of Jews in Arabia. Historians claim that very large numbers of Jews – as many as 80,000 – arrived after the destruction of the First Temple, to join others already long-established in places such as the oasis of Khaybar as well as the trading colonies in Medina and Mecca (where they had their own cemetery). Another theory posits that these Jews were refugees from Byzantine persecutions. Arab historians mention some 20 Jewish communities, including two of Kohanim.\n\nThe Constitution of Medina, written shortly after hijra, addressed some points regarding the civil and religious situation for the Jewish communities living within the city from an Islamic perspective. For example, the constitution stated that the Jews \"will profess their religion, and the Muslims theirs\", and they \"shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for theirs\". After the Battle of Badr, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qaynuqa breached treaties and agreements with Muhammad. Muhammad regarded this as casus belli and besieged the Banu Qaynuqa. Upon surrender the tribe was expelled. The following year saw the expulsion of the second tribe, the Banu Nadir, accused of planning to kill the prophet Muhammad. The third major Jewish tribe in Medina, Banu Qurayza was eliminated after betraying the Muslims during the Battle of the Trench. However, there were many Jewish communities in Medina who continued to live in Medina peacefully after these events such as Banu Awf, Banu Harith, Banu Jusham Banu Alfageer, Banu Najjar, Banu Sa'ida, and Banu Shutayba.\n\nIn year 20 of the Muslim era, or the year 641 AD, Muhammad's successor the Caliph Umar decreed that Jews and Christians should be removed from all but the southern and eastern fringes of Arabia—a decree based on the uttering of the Prophet: \"Let there not be two religions in Arabia\". The two populations in question were the Jews of the Khaybar oasis in the north and the Christians of Najran. Only the Red Sea port of Jeddah was permitted as a \"religious quarantine area\" and continued to have a small complement of Jewish merchants.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Jewish people under Muslim rule experienced tolerance and integration. Some historians refer to this time period as the \"Golden Age\" for the Jews, as more opportunities became available to them. In the context of day-to-day life, Abdel Fattah Ashour, a professor of medieval history at Cairo University, states that Jewish people found solace under Islamic rule during the Middle Ages. The Muslim rule at times didn't fully enforce the Pact of Umar and the traditional Dhimmi status of Jews; i.e., the Jews sometimes, as in eleventh-century Granada, were not second-class citizens. Author Merlin Swartz referred to this time period as a new era for the Jews, stating that the attitude of tolerance led to Jewish integration into Arab-Islamic society.\n\nSocial integration allowed Jews to make great advances in new fields, including mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, chemistry and philology, with some even gaining political power under Islamic rule. For example, the vizier of Baghdad entrusted his capital to Jewish bankers, Jews were put in charge of certain parts of maritime and slave trade, and Siraf, the principal port of the caliphate in the 10th century, had a Jewish governor. Increased commercial freedom increased their integration into the Arab marketplace. Leon Poliakov writes that in the early ages of Islam, Jews enjoyed great privileges, and their communities prospered. No laws or social barriers restricted their commercial activities, and exclusive trade and craft guilds like those in Europe did not exist. Jews who moved to Muslim lands found themselves free to engage in any profession, resulting in less stigma than in Europe where such restrictions were still in force. This, coupled with more intense Christian persecution, encouraged many Jews to migrate to areas newly conquered by Muslims and establish communities there.\n\nAlthough Jewish life improved under Islamic rule, an interfaith utopia did not exist. Jews still experienced persecution. Under Islamic Rule, the Pact of Umar was introduced, which protected the Jews but also established them as inferior. Since the 11th century, there have been instances of pogroms against Jews. Examples include the 1066 Granada massacre, the razing of the entire Jewish quarter in the Andalucian city of Granada. In North Africa, there were cases of violence against Jews in the Middle Ages, and in other Arab lands including Egypt, Syria and Yemen Beginning in the 15th century, the Moroccan Jewish population was confined to segregated quarters known as mellahs. In cities, these were surrounded by walls and a fortified gateway. Rural \"mellahs\", however, were separate villages inhabited solely by Jews. The Almohads, who had taken control of much of Islamic Iberia by 1172, were far more fundamentalist in outlook than the Almoravides, and they treated the \"dhimmis\" harshly. Jews and Christians were expelled from Morocco and Islamic Spain. Faced with the choice of either death or conversion, some Jews, such as the family of Maimonides, fled south and east to more tolerant Muslim lands, while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms. In 1465, Arab mobs in Fez slaughtered thousands of Jews, leaving only 11 alive, after a Jewish deputy vizier treated a Muslim woman in an offensive manner. The killings touched off a wave of similar massacres throughout Morocco.\n\nHistorian Mark R. Cohen proposes a comparative approach to understanding Jewish life under Islamic rule, noting that Jews in Islamic lands often experienced less physical violence than Jews under Western Christendom. He posits that Muslims considered Jews less theologically threatening than Christians did, suggesting that the Christians wanted to establish a separate religious identity from Judaism, from which their faith split and diverged. According to him, instances of persecution were occasional, more the exception than the rule, and claims of systemic persecution at the hands of Muslim rulers are myths created to bolster political propaganda. The situation where Jews in the Muslim world both enjoyed cultural and economic prosperity at times, but were widely persecuted there at other times, was summarised by G. E. Von Grunebaum:\n\nIt would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.\n\nJews have lived in Asia Minor for more than 2,400 years. Originally settling in Asia Minor in the Hellenistic era, they were expelled by Byzantines between the 5th and 11th centuries, resettling there only after the conquest of much of Anatolia by Muslim Seljuk forces after the Battle of Manzikert. Jewish communities grew and thrived under the Seljuks, and later also under Ottoman rule, making it a safe haven for Jews fleeing from persecution elsewhere.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire served as a refuge for Jewish refugees from Spanish empire, especially after the fall of Muslim Spain in 1492 and Edict of Expulsion. This continued through the Roman Catholic Inquisition, as secret Jews and forced converts continued to flee Spain. The Maghreb from North Africa similarly found refuge among the Ottomans, as large Arabian cities created their own restrictive Jewish quarters (\"Mellahs\").\nIn 1834, in Safed, Ottoman Syria, local Muslim Arabs carried out a massacre of the Jewish population known as the Safed Plunder.\n\nIn 1840, the Jews of Damascus were falsely accused of having murdered a Christian monk and his Muslim servant and of having used their blood to bake Passover bread. A Jewish barber was tortured until he \"confessed\"; two other Jews who were arrested died under torture, while a third converted to Islam to save his life. Throughout the 1860s, the Jews of Libya were subjected to what Gilbert calls punitive taxation. In 1864, around 500 Jews were killed in Marrakech and Fez in Morocco. In 1869, 18 Jews were killed in Tunis, and an Arab mob on Jerba Island looted and burned Jewish homes, stores, and synagogues. In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in Demnat, Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight. In 1897, synagogues were ransacked and Jews were murdered in Tripolitania.\n\nJews lived in Kurdistan for thousands of years, before the final and mass migration in 1951-1952 to Israel. The Jews lived under the Ottoman Empire and under the Persian Empire for many years and following World War I, they lived mainly in Iraq, Iran and Turkey, some lived in Syria. Jews lived in many Kurdish urban centers such as Aqra, Dohuk, Arbil, Zakho, Sulaimaniya, Amadia, in Southern Kurdistan, in Saqiz, Bana and Ushno, in Eastern Kurdistan, in Jezira, Nisebin, Mardin and Diyarbakır in Turkey and in Qamishle in North-Western Syria. Jews lived as well in hundreds of villages in the rural and tribal area of Kurdistan, usually one or two families in a village, where they worked as weavers of traditional Kurdish clothing or as tenants of the \"agha\", the landlord or head of the village.\n\nIn 1656, all Jews were expelled from Isfahan and forced to convert to Islam because of a common belief that their Jewishness was impure. However, as it became known that the converts continued to practice Judaism in secret and because the treasury suffered from the loss of \"jizya\" collected from the Jews, in 1661 they were allowed to revert to Judaism, although they were still required to wear a distinctive patch on their clothing.\n\nIn 1839, in the eastern Persian city of Meshed, a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the Torah scrolls. The Jews themselves were violently forced to convert, narrowly avoiding complete massacre. There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867. In 1839, the Allahdad incident, the Jews of Mashhad, Iran, now known as the Mashhadi Jews, were coerced into converting to Islam.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, J. J. Benjamin wrote of Persian Jews: \"…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town…; for they are considered as unclean creatures… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt… For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans… If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults. The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him… unmercifully… If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods… Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)…, he is sure to be murdered.\"\n\nA number of groups of Persian Jews have split off since ancient times, to the extent that they are now recognized as separate communities, such as the Bukharian Jews and Mountain Jews.\n\nConfined to city quarters, the Bukharan Jews were denied basic rights and many were forced to convert to Islam. They had to wear black and yellow dress to distinguish themselves from the Muslims.\n\nUnder the Zaydi rule, discriminatory laws became more severe against the Yemenite Jews, which culminated in their eventual exile, in what later became known as the Exile of Mawza. They were considered to be impure, and therefore forbidden to touch a Muslim or a Muslim's food. They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, to walk to the left side, and greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslim's or ride a camel or horse, and when riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. Upon entering the Muslim quarter a Jew had to take off his foot-gear and walk barefoot. If attacked with stones or fists by Islamic youth, a Jew was not allowed to defend himself. In such situations he had the option of fleeing or seeking intervention by a merciful Muslim passerby.\n\nBy the mid 1970s the vast majority of Jews had left, fled or had been expelled from Arab and Muslim-majority countries, moving primarily to Israel, France and the United States. The reasons for the exodus are varied and disputed. In 1945, there were between 758,000 and 866,000 Jews living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,000. In some Arab states, such as Libya, which once had a Jewish population of around 3 percent, similar to that of the United States today), the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.\n\nThe largest communities of Jews in Muslim countries exist in the non-Arab countries of Iran and Turkey; both, however, are much smaller than they historically have been. Among Arab countries, the largest Jewish community now exists in Morocco with about 2,000 Jews and in Tunisia with about 1,000.\n\nJudaism is the second-oldest religion still existing in Iran after Zoroastrianism. By various estimates, between 8,000 and 10,000 Jews remain in Iran, mostly in Tehran and Hamedan. About one-third of the some 120,000-150,000 Iranian Jews in the mid-20th century fled the country during the 1950s, as a consequence of political instability. Most of the remaining 80,000-100,000 Jews fled during and following the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\n\nToday, the largest groups of Persian Jews are found in Israel (236,000-360,000 in 2014, including second-generation Israelis) and the United States (45,000, especially in the Los Angeles area, home to a large concentration of expatriate Iranians). There are also smaller communities in Western Europe.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first published by Leslie Holdridge in 1947, and updated in 1967. It is a relatively simple system based on few empirical data, giving objective mapping criteria. A basic assumption of the system is that both soil and climax vegetation can be mapped once climate is known.\n\nWhile it was first designed for tropical and subtropical areas, the system applies globally. The system has been shown to fit tropical vegetation zones, Mediterranean zones, and boreal zones, but is less applicable to cold oceanic or cold arid climates where moisture becomes the determining factor. The system has found a major use in assessing the possible changes in natural vegetation patterns due to global warming.\n\nThe three axes of the barycentric subdivisions are:\n\nFurther indicators incorporated into the system are:\n\nBiotemperature is based on the growing season length and temperature. It is measured as the mean of all temperatures above freezing, with all temperatures below freezing and above 30 °C adjusted to 0 °C, as plants are dormant at these temperatures. Holdridge's system uses biotemperature first, rather than the temperate latitude bias of Merriam's life zones, and does not primarily consider elevation. The system is considered more appropriate to the complexities of tropical vegetation than Merriam's system.\n\nPotential evapotranspiration (PET) is the amount of water that would be evaporated and transpired if there were sufficient water available. High temperatures result in higher PET. Evapotranspiration (ET) is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the Earth's land surface to atmosphere. Evapotranspiration can never be greater than PET. The ratio, Precipitation/PET, is the aridity index (AI), with an AI<0.2 indicating arid/hyperarid, and AI<0.5 indicating dry.\nColdest regions have not much evapotranspiration nor precipitation, hence polar deserts. In the warmer regions, there are deserts with maximum PET but low rainfall that make the soil even drier, and rain forests with low PET and maximum rainfall causing river systems to drain excess water into oceans.\n\nThe classes defined within the system, as used by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), are:\n\n"}
{"id": "1287236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1287236", "title": "Innatism", "text": "Innatism\n\nInnatism is a philosophical and epistemological doctrine that holds that the mind is born with ideas/knowledge, and that therefore the mind is not a \"blank slate\" at birth, as early empiricists such as John Locke claimed. It asserts that not all knowledge is gained from experience and the senses. Plato and Descartes are prominent philosophers in the development of innatism and the notion that the mind is already born with ideas, knowledge and beliefs. Both philosophers emphasize that experiences are the key to unlocking this knowledge but not the source of the knowledge itself. Essentially, no knowledge is derived exclusively from one's experiences as empiricists like John Locke suggested.\n\nIn general usage, the terms \"innatism\" and \"nativism\" are synonymous as they both refer to notions of preexisting ideas present in the mind. However, more correctly, innatism refers to the philosophy of Plato and Descartes, who assumed that a God or a similar being or process placed innate ideas and principles in the human mind.\n\nNativism represents an adaptation of this, grounded in the fields of genetics, cognitive psychology, and psycholinguistics. Nativists hold that innate beliefs are in some way genetically programmed to arise in our mind—that innate beliefs are the phenotypes of certain genotypes that all humans share in common.\n\nNativism is a modern view rooted in innatism. The advocates of nativism are mainly philosophers who also work in the field of cognitive psychology or psycholinguistics: most notably Noam Chomsky and Jerry Fodor (although the latter has adopted a more critical attitude towards nativism in his later writings). The nativist's general objection against empiricism is still the same as was raised by the rationalists; the human mind of a newborn child is not a tabula rasa, but equipped with an inborn structure.\n\nIn philosophy and psychology, an innate idea is a concept or item of knowledge which is said to be \"universal to all humanity\"—that is, something people are born with rather than something people have \"learned\" through experience.\n\nThe issue is controversial, and can be said to be an aspect of a long-running nature versus nurture debate, albeit one localized to the question of understanding human cognition.\n\nAlthough individual human beings obviously vary due to cultural, racial, linguistic and era-specific influences, innate ideas are said to belong to a more fundamental level of human cognition. For example, the philosopher René Descartes theorized that knowledge of God is innate in everybody as a product of the faculty of faith.\n\nOther philosophers, most notably the empiricists, were critical of the theory and denied the existence of any innate ideas, saying all human knowledge was founded on experience, rather than \"a priori\" reasoning.\n\nPhilosophically, the debate over innate ideas is central to the conflict between rationalist and empiricist epistemologies. While rationalists believe that certain ideas exist independently of experience, empiricism claims that all knowledge is derived from experience.\n\nImmanuel Kant was a German philosopher who is regarded as having ended the impasse in modern philosophy between rationalists and empiricists, and is widely held to have synthesized these two early modern traditions in his thought.\n\nPlato argues that if there are certain concepts that we know to be true but did not learn from experience then it must be because we have an innate knowledge of it and this knowledge must have been gained before birth. In Plato's \"Meno\", he recalls a situation in which Socrates, his mentor, questioned a slave boy about a geometry theorem. Though the slave boy had no previous experience with geometry, he was able to generate the right responses to the questions he was asked. Plato reasoned that this was possible as Socrates' questions sparked the innate knowledge of math the boy had had from birth.\n\nDescartes conveys the idea that innate knowledge or ideas is something inborn such as one would say, that a certain disease might be 'innate' to signify that a person might be at risk of contacting such a disease. He suggests that something that is 'innate' is effectively present from birth and while it may not reveal itself then, is more than likely to present itself later in life. Descartes comparison of innate knowledge to an innate disease, whose symptoms may only show up later in life, unless prohibited by a factor like age or puberty, suggests that if an event occurs prohibiting someone from exhibiting an innate behaviour or knowledge, it doesn’t mean the knowledge did not exist at all but rather it wasn’t expressed – they were not able to acquire that knowledge. In other words, innate beliefs, ideas and knowledge require experiences to be triggered or they may never be expressed. Experiences are not the source of knowledge as proposed by John Locke, but catalysts to the uncovering of knowledge.\n\nThe main antagonist to the concept of innate ideas is John Locke, a contemporary of Leibniz. Locke argued that the mind is in fact devoid of all knowledge or ideas at birth; it is a blank sheet or \"tabula rasa\". He argued that all our ideas are constructed in the mind via a process of constant composition and decomposition of the input that we receive through our senses.\n\nLocke, in \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\", suggests that the concept of universal assent in fact proves nothing, except perhaps that everyone is in agreement; in short universal assent proves that there is universal assent and nothing else. Moreover, Locke goes on to suggest that in fact there \"is\" no universal assent. Even a phrase such as \"What is, is\" is not universally assented to; infants and severely handicapped adults do not generally acknowledge this truism. Locke also attacks the idea that an innate idea can be imprinted on the mind without the owner realizing it. For Locke, such reasoning would allow one to conclude the absurd: “all the Truths a Man ever comes to know, will, by this account, be, every one of them, innate.” To return to the musical analogy, we may not be able to recall the entire melody until we hear the first few notes, but we were aware of the fact that we knew the melody and that upon hearing the first few notes we would be able to recall the rest.\n\nLocke ends his attack upon innate ideas by suggesting that the mind is a \"tabula rasa\" or \"blank slate\", and that all ideas come from experience; all our knowledge is founded in sensory experience.\n\nEssentially, the same knowledge thought to be \"a priori\" by Leibniz is in fact, according to Locke, the result of empirical knowledge, which has a lost origin [been forgotten] in respect to the inquirer. However, the inquirer is not cognizant of this fact; thus, he experiences what he believes to be \"a priori\" knowledge.\n\n1) The theory of innate knowledge is excessive. Even innatists accept that most of our knowledge is learned through experience, but if that can be extended to account for all knowledge, we learn colour through seeing it, so therefore, there is no need for a theory about an innate understanding of colour.\n\n2) No ideas are universally held. Do we all possess the idea of God? Do we all believe in justice and beauty? Do we all understand the law of identity? If not, it may not be the case that we have acquired these ideas through impressions/experience/social interaction (this is the children's and idiot's criticism).\n\n3) Even if there are some universally agreed statements, it is just the ability of the human brain to organize learned ideas/words, that is, innate. An \"ability to organize\" is not the same as \"possessing propositional knowledge\" (e.g., a computer with no saved files has all the operations programmed in but has an empty memory).\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz suggested that we are born with certain innate ideas, the most identifiable of these being mathematical truisms. The idea that \"1 + 1 = 2\" is evident to us without the necessity for empirical evidence. Leibniz argues that empiricism can only show us that concepts are true in the present; the observation of one apple and then another in one instance, and in that instance only, leads to the conclusion that one and another equals two. However, the suggestion that one and another will always equal two require an innate idea, as that would be a suggestion of things unwitnessed.\n\nLeibniz called such concepts as mathematical truisms \"necessary truths\". Another example of such may be the phrase, \"what is, is\" or \"it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be\". Leibniz argues that such truisms are universally assented to (acknowledged by all to be true); this being the case, it must be due to their status as innate ideas. Often there are ideas that are acknowledged as necessarily true but are not universally assented to. Leibniz would suggest that this is simply because the person in question has not become aware of the innate idea, not because they do not possess it. Leibniz argues that empirical evidence can serve to bring to the surface certain principles that are already innately embedded in our minds. This is similar to needing to hear only the first few notes in order to recall the rest of the melody.\n\nIn his \"Meno\", Plato raises an important epistemological quandary: How is it that we have certain ideas which are not conclusively derivable from our environments? Noam Chomsky has taken this problem as a philosophical framework for the scientific enquiry into innatism. His linguistic theory, which derives from 18th century classical-liberal thinkers such as Wilhelm von Humboldt, attempts to explain in cognitive terms how we can develop knowledge of systems which are said, by supporters of innatism, to be too rich and complex to be derived from our environment. One such example is our linguistic faculty. Our linguistic systems contain a systemic complexity which supposedly could not be empirically derived: the environment seems too poor, variable and indeterminate, according to Chomsky, to explain the extraordinary ability to learn complex concepts possessed by very young children. Essentially, their accurate grammatical knowledge cannot have originated from their experiences as their experiences are not adequate. It follows that humans must be born with a universal innate grammar, which is determinate and has a highly organized directive component, and enables the language learner to ascertain and categorize language heard into a system. Chomsky states that the ability to learn how to properly construct sentences or know which sentences are grammatically incorrect is an ability gained from innate knowledge. Noam Chomsky cites as evidence for this theory, the apparent invariability, according to his views, of human languages at a fundamental level. In this way, linguistics may provide a window into the human mind, and establish scientific theories of innateness which otherwise would remain merely speculative.\n\nOne implication of Noam Chomsky's innatism, if correct, is that at least a part of human knowledge consists in cognitive predispositions, which are triggered and developed by the environment, but not determined by it. Chomsky suggests that we can look at how a belief is acquired as an input-output situation. He supports the doctrine of innatism as he states that human beliefs gathered from sensory experience are much richer and complex than the experience itself. He asserts that the extra information gathered is from the mind itself as it cannot solely be from experiences. Humans derive excess amount of information from their environment so some of that information must be pre-determined.\n\nParallels can then be drawn, on a purely speculative level, between our moral faculties and language, as has been done by sociobiologists such as E. O. Wilson and evolutionary psychologists such as Steven Pinker. The relative consistency of fundamental notions of morality across cultures seems to produce convincing evidence for these theories. In psychology, notions of archetypes such as those developed by Carl Jung, suggest determinate identity perceptions.\n\nEvidence for innatism is being found by neuroscientists working on the Blue Brain Project. They discovered that neurons transmit signals despite an individual's experience. It had been previously assumed that neuronal circuits are made when the experience of an individual is imprinted in the brain, making memories. Researchers at Blue Brain discovered a network of about fifty neurons which they believed were building blocks of more complex knowledge but contained basic innate knowledge that could be combined in different more complex ways to give way to acquired knowledge, like memory.\n\nScientists ran tests on the neuronal circuits of several rats and ascertained that if the neuronal circuits had only been formed based on an individual's experience, the tests would bring about very different characteristics for each rat. However, the rats all displayed similar characteristics which suggests that their neuronal circuits must have been established previously to their experiences – it must be inborn and created prior to their experiences. The research done in the Blue Brain project expresses that some the building blocks of all our knowledge, is genetic and we're born with it.\n\nThere are two ways in which animals can gain knowledge. The first of these two ways is learning. This is when an animal gathers information about its surrounding environment and then proceeds to use this information. For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it has learned not to eat this again. The second way that an animal can acquire knowledge is through innate knowledge. This knowledge is genetically inherited. The animal automatically knows it without any prior experience. An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk. The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it. In some scenarios, innate knowledge is more beneficial than learned knowledge. However, in other scenarios the opposite is true.\n\nIn a changing environment, an animal must constantly be gaining new information in order to survive. However, in a stable environment this same individual need only to gather the information it needs once and rely on it for the duration of its life. Therefore, there are different scenarios in which learning or innate knowledge is better suited.\nEssentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of having it determined whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighed the benefit of having it, then the individual would not have evolved to learn in this scenario; instead, non-learning would evolve. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighed the cost of obtaining it, then the animal would be far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.\n\nNon-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios. If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs then learning would simply be unnecessary. Because there is no need for learning in this scenario – and because learning could prove to be disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information – non-learning evolves. However, if an environment were in a constant state of change then learning would also prove to be disadvantageous. Anything learned would immediately become irrelevant because of the changing environment. The learned information would no longer apply. Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned. In this situation, non-learning would evolve.\n\nHowever, in environments where change occurs but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve. Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can adapt to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time. Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing and adapts to changes in the environment as opposed to innate knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a focal point in the movement for women's rights.\n\nAfter the Socialist Party of America organised a Women's Day on February 28, 1909 in New York, the 1910 International Socialist Woman's Conference suggested a Women's Day be held annually. After women gained suffrage in Soviet Russia in 1917, March 8 became a national holiday there. The day was then predominantly celebrated by the socialist movement and communist countries until it was adopted in 1975 by the United Nations.\n\nToday, International Women's Day is a public holiday in some countries and largely ignored elsewhere. In some places, it is a day of protest; in others, it is a day that celebrates womanhood.\n\nThe earliest Women's Day observance, called \"National Woman's Day,\" was held on February 28, 1909 in New York, organized by the Socialist Party of America at the suggestion of Theresa Malkiel. Though there have been claims that the day was commemorating a protest by women garment workers in New York on March 8, 1857, researchers have described this as a myth.\n\nIn August 1910, an International Socialist Women's Conference was organized to precede the general meeting of the Socialist Second International in Copenhagen, Denmark. Inspired in part by the American socialists, German Socialist Luise Zietz proposed the establishment of an annual Women's Day and was seconded by fellow socialist and later communist leader Clara Zetkin, supported by Käte Duncker, although no date was specified at that conference. Delegates (100 women from 17 countries) agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights including suffrage for women. The following year on March 19, 1911, IWD was marked for the first time, by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. In the Austro-Hungarian Empire alone, there were 300 demonstrations. In Vienna, women paraded on the Ringstrasse and carried banners honouring the martyrs of the Paris Commune. Women demanded that they be given the right to vote and to hold public office. They also protested against employment sex discrimination. The Americans continued to celebrate National Women's Day on the last Sunday in February.\n\nIn 1913 Russian women observed their first International Women's Day on the last Saturday in February (by the Julian calendar then used in Russia).\n\nIn 1914 International Women's Day was held on March 8 in Germany, possibly because that day was a Sunday, and now it is always held on March 8 in all countries. The 1914 observance of the Day in Germany was dedicated to women's right to vote, which German women did not win until 1918.\n\nIn London there was a march from Bow to Trafalgar Square in support of women's suffrage on March 8, 1914. Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested in front of Charing Cross station on her way to speak in Trafalgar Square.\n\nOn March 8, 1917, on the Gregorian calendar, in the capital of the Russian Empire, Petrograd, women textile workers began a demonstration, covering the whole city. This marked the beginning of the February Revolution, which alongside the October Revolution made up the Russian Revolution. Women in Saint Petersburg went on strike that day for \"Bread and Peace\" – demanding the end of World War I, an end to Russian food shortages, and the end of czarism. Leon Trotsky wrote, \"23 February (8th March) was International Woman's Day and meetings and actions were foreseen. But we did not imagine that this 'Women's Day' would inaugurate the revolution. Revolutionary actions were foreseen but without date. But in the morning, despite the orders to the contrary, textile workers left their work in several factories and sent delegates to ask for support of the strike… which led to mass strike... all went out into the streets.\" Seven days later, the Emperor of Russia, Nicholas II abdicated and the provisional Government granted women the right to vote.\n\nFollowing the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Alexandra Kollontai and Vladimir Lenin made it an official holiday in the Soviet Union, but it was a working day until 1965. On May 8, 1965 by the decree of the USSR Presidium of the Supreme Soviet International Women's Day was declared a non-working day in the USSR \"in commemoration of the outstanding merits of Soviet women in communistic construction, in the defense of their Fatherland during the Great Patriotic War, in their heroism and selflessness at the front and in the rear, and also marking the great contribution of women to strengthening friendship between peoples, and the struggle for peace. But still, women's day must be celebrated as are other holidays.\"\n\nFrom its official adoption in Soviet Russia following the Revolution in 1917, the holiday was predominantly celebrated in communist countries and by the communist movement worldwide. It was celebrated by the communists in China from 1922. After the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the State Council proclaimed on December 23 that March 8 would be made an official holiday with women in China given a half-day off.\n\nCommunist leader Dolores Ibárruri led a women's march in Madrid in 1936 on the eve of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe United Nations began celebrating International Women's Day in the International Women's Year, 1975. In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly invited member states to proclaim March 8 as the UN Day for women's rights and world peace.\n\nOn the occasion of 2010 International Women's Day the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) drew attention to the hardships displaced women endure. The displacement of populations is one of the gravest consequences of today's armed conflicts. It affects women in a host of ways.\n\nThough the celebration in the West was low-key, events took place in more than 100 countries on March 8, 2011 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day. In the United States, President Barack Obama proclaimed March 2011 to be \"Women's History Month\", calling Americans to mark IWD by reflecting on \"the extraordinary accomplishments of women\" in shaping the country's history. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched the \"100 Women Initiative: Empowering Women and Girls through International Exchanges\", on the eve of IWD. In the run-up to 2011 International Women's Day, the Red Cross called on States and other entities not to relent in their efforts to prevent rape and other forms of sexual violence that harm the lives and dignity of countless women in conflict zones around the world every year.\n\nAustralia issued an IWD 100th anniversary commemorative 20-cent coin.\n\nIn Egypt, however, the day was a step back for women. In Egypt's Tahrir Square, hundreds of men came out not in support, but to harass the women who came out to stand up for their rights as the police and military stood by watching the events unfold in front of them, doing nothing to stop the crowds of men. \"The women – some in headscarves and flowing robes, others in jeans – had marched to Cairo's central Tahrir Square to celebrate International Women's Day. But crowds of men soon outnumbered them and chased them out\", wrote Hadeel Al-Shalchi for The Associated Press (AP).\n\nThe UN theme for International Women's Day 2012 was Empower Rural Women – End Hunger and Poverty. In that year, Oxfam America invited people to celebrate inspiring women in their lives by sending a free International Women's Day e-Card or honoring a woman whose efforts had made a difference in the fight against hunger and poverty with Oxfam's International Women's Day award.\n\nOn the occasion of International Women's Day 2012, the ICRC called for more action to help the mothers and wives of people who have gone missing during armed conflict. The vast majority of people who go missing in connection with conflict are men. As well as the anguish of not knowing what has happened to the missing husband or son, many of these women face economic and practical difficulties. The ICRC underlined the duty of parties to a conflict to search for the missing and provide information to the families.\n\nThe UN theme for International Women's Day 2013 was \"A promise is a promise: Time for action to end violence against women\", while International Women's Day 2013 declared the year's theme as The Gender Agenda: Gaining Momentum.\n\nThe 2013 International Women's Day, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) draw attention to the plight of women in prison.\n\nThe UN theme for International Women's Day 2014 was \"Equality for Women is Progress for All\".\n\nAmerican singer Beyoncé also posted an International Women's Day video to her YouTube account. Throughout the video, her song \"***Flawless\" plays, which includes a portion of the \"We Should All Be Feminists\" speech given by author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.\n\nThe UN theme for International Women's Day 2015 was \"Empowering Women, Empowering Humanity: Picture it!\". Governments and activists around the world will commemorate the 20th anniversary year of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, an historic roadmap that sets the agenda for realizing women's rights.\n\nThe International Women's Day theme for 2016 was \"Planet 50-50 by 2030: Step It Up for Gender Equality\".\n\nThe President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, in his message issued on the eve of International Women's Day said: \"On the occasion of International Women's Day, I extend warm greetings and good wishes to the women of India and thank them for their contributions over the years in the building of our nation.\" The ministry of women and child development announced the setting up of four more one-stop crisis centers on March 8, in addition to the eight already functioning across the country. Ahead of Women's Day, the national carrier Air India operated what it claimed to be the world's longest non-stop flight where the entire flight operations were handled by women, as part of International Women's Day celebrations. The flight, from Delhi to San Francisco, covered a distance of around 14,500 kilometers in around 17 hours.\n\nThe theme for International Women's Day 2017 was \"Women in the Changing World of Work: Planet 50-50 by 2030\".\n\nIn a message in support of International Women's Day, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres commented on how women's rights were being \"reduced, restricted and reversed\". With men still in leadership positions and a widening economic gender gap, he called for change \"by empowering women at all levels, enabling their voices to be heard and giving them control over their own lives and over the future of our world\".\n\nThe theme for International Women's Day 2018 was 'Time is Now: Rural and urban activists transforming women’s lives'.\n\nThe day is an official holiday in Afghanistan, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, China (for women only), Cuba, Georgia, Guinea-Bissau, Eritrea, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Madagascar (for women only), Moldova, Mongolia, Nepal, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Zambia.\n\nIn some countries, such as Cameroon, Croatia, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Chile, the day is not a public holiday, but is widely observed nonetheless.\nOn this day it is customary for men to give the women in their lives – friends, mothers, wives, girlfriends, daughters, colleagues, etc. – flowers and small gifts. In some countries (such as Bulgaria and Romania) it is also observed as an equivalent of Mother's Day, where children also give small presents to their mothers and grandmothers. In Russia, the day has lost all political context through the time, becoming simply a day to honor women and feminine beauty.\n\nIn the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually. After the fall of Communism, the holiday, generally considered to be one of the major symbols of the old regime, fell into obscurity. International Women's Day was re-established as an official \"important day\" by the Parliament of the Czech Republic in 2004 on the proposal of the Social Democrats and Communists. This has provoked some controversy as a large part of the public as well as the political right see the holiday as a relic of the nation's Communist past.\n\nInternational Women's Day sparked violence in Tehran, Iran on March 4, 2007, when police beat hundreds of men and women who were planning a rally. (A previous rally for the occasion was held in Tehran in 2003.) Police arrested dozens of women and some were released after several days of solitary confinement and interrogation. Shadi Sadr, Mahbubeh Abbasgholizadeh and several more community activists were released on March 19, 2007, ending a fifteen-day hunger strike.\nIn Italy, to celebrate the day, men give yellow mimosas to women. Communist politician Teresa Mattei chose the mimosa in 1946 as the symbol of IWD in Italy because she felt that the French symbols of the day, violets and lily-of-the-valley, were too scarce and expensive to be used effectively in Italy.\n\nIn the United States, actress and human rights activist Beata Pozniak worked with the Mayor of Los Angeles and the Governor of California to lobby members of the U.S. Congress to propose official recognition of the holiday. In February 1994, H. J. Res. 316 was introduced by Rep. Maxine Waters, along with 79 cosponsors, in an attempt to officially recognize March 8 of that year as International Women's Day. The bill was subsequently referred to, and remained in, the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. No vote of either house of Congress was achieved on this piece of legislation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bonewits and Bonewits have noted parallels in quantum physics.\n\nAccording to this law, contagion has both dangers and benefits.

{"id": "28730200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28730200", "title": "Life at the Bottom", "text": "Life at the Bottom\n\nLife at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass is a collection of essays written by British writer, doctor, and psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple and published in book form by Ivan R. Dee in 2001. In 1994, the Manhattan Institute started publishing the contents of these essays in the \"City Journal\" magazine. They are about personal responsibility, the mentality of society as a whole, and the troubles of the underclass. Dalrymple had problems in finding a British publisher to help him turn his individual essays into a collection, so he eventually turned to American companies for publication.\n\nThe main themes expressed in the collection include how an individual's worldview (\"Weltanschauung\") affects their actions and the attitudes of those around them, the philosophy of social determinism, and why a lack of personal responsibility for one's actions results from an individual's beliefs in determinism. The writing style that Dalrymple explains these in was praised by reviewers for its clear, witty prose and for going immediately to the truth and heart of any matter that is being discussed.\n\nMost reviews of the collection were positive, applauding how Dalrymple had utilised his experiences to create a work that gives a transparent look at poverty in England. The main detraction that reviewers had for the collection was that Dalrymple often became too opinionated in his writing while he was trying to get across the results of his experiences.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2000, \"Theodore Dalrymple\", whose real name is Anthony Daniels, worked as a physician at City Hospital and Birmingham Prison, both located in the Winson Green area of Birmingham, England. During this time, he wrote essays on topics related to his work, such as his discussions with patients and inmates. Individual essays began being published periodically in the American quarterly magazine \"City Journal\" in 1994. The collection does not contain all of the essays he wrote about his experiences, but only the ones he considered the best, whether for their humour or their truth.\n\nThe experiences and situations described are largely anecdotal, but Dalrymple explains that he interviewed over 10,000 people who attempted suicide and had them tell stories about \"the lives of four or five other people\", resulting in a sample base of around 50,000 individuals. Since he is writing about the English underclass, Dalrymple acknowledges that the majority of the people interviewed, remembered, and discussed about are white. According to social critic Thomas Sowell, this allows a look at the underclass \"without fear of being called 'racist'.\"\n\nIn his attempts to have his collection published in a single work, Dalrymple turned to \"an American house of conservative leaning\" because he had little luck with British publishers. The publisher who eventually helped Dalrymple release the book was the Ivan R. Dee imprint of Rowman & Littlefield publishing house. They published the collection as a hardcover in 2001.\n\nThe collection of essays has an introduction, an index, and two sections called \"\"Grim Reality\" and \"Grimmer Theory\". The sections are individually broken up into chapters, with sixteen in \"Grim Reality\" and six in \"Grimmer Theory\"\". Each chapter is an individual essay, which were published in separate issues of \"City Journal\" around seven years prior. The chapters are organised thematically, not necessarily in chronological order. The essays focus largely on the underclass and the premise that in the latter half of the 20th century, poverty, and hunger are no longer descriptive of the poor. Instead, lack of money has been replaced with \"emptiness, agonies, violence, and moral squalor\".\n\nThe main argument represented in the collection is that, rather than economics and wealth, modern-style poverty is described by a \"wildly dysfunctional set of values\". A number of chapters discuss the \"ferocious young egoist\" that is meant to represent male youths who are violent and obsessive toward their significant others. Dalrymple also writes about his views on the \"destruction of...family ties\", arguing that without family ties it is nearly impossible to rise out of the underclass. These issues, among others, are described as resulting from the \"intellectual foundation...[which] makes a permanent underclass possible\". This is meant to be directed against intellectuals and liberals that form the many ideas absorbed into the mentality of the underclass.\n\nIn the larger first section titled \"Grim Reality\", Dalrymple \"uses specific stories from his practice and from some journalistic forays to show how the 'fundamental premise of popular culture' leads to actions that wreck people's lives.\" This section covers things like modern Bohemianism, drug addictions and overdoses, lack of education, familial obligations, physical abuse, and the concept of personal responsibility for choices made. Then, in the section \"Grimmer Theory\", he \"shows that the twentieth century's intellectuals have provided members of the underclass with a battery of rationalizations by which they can shift the blame for their misery away from their actions and attitudes and can unleash their hatred of everyone who challenges their outlook.\". Focusing on ideas more than events, this section considers the concepts of relativism, determinism, and egalitarianism, and how each idea, in their creation by the bourgeoisie intellectuals, adversely affects the underclass.\n\nThe work explores the various worldviews of individuals and societies, and the impositions of society on those within it. Dalrymple states that \"...everyone has a Weltanschauung, a worldview, whether he knows it or not...Their ideas make themselves manifest even in the language they use.\" The example stated is the use of passive speech by \"those who refuse to accept responsibility for their acts\". The type of language that the underclass uses, according to Dalrymple, professes their own ideas and ideology about the world.\n\nThe book also explains the philosophy of social determinism held by those Dalrymple interviewed, and how the welfare state and the socialist tenets within it help feed this mindset. However, Dalrymple never directly accuses socialism and the welfare state in his essays, instead focusing on the beliefs and reasons for why the patients and inmates take the destructive actions that they did. This is expressed with determinism in that they believe that their actions must be based on their childhoods or the failure of society in the past to help them. Those patients that Dalrymple speaks with \"seem surprised and tell him that he's the first person they've ever talked to who suggests that they can change their lives for the better,\" further emphasising the mindset in which their society has placed them.\n\nAn important subset to this deterministic theme, related to the original worldview idea as well, is the lack of personal responsibility that those in the underclass accept for their own actions. An example of this, which is repeated numerous times throughout the collection, is the statement, \"The knife went in\", in reference to the words of one of Dalrymple's patients who was in jail for murder. This sort of speech makes a person's actions seem like they are something separate from the person themselves and that they have no control over it.\n\nA sub-theme that is mentioned is the conflict between two groups, the Indian Sikhs and the Pakistani Muslims, who \"not only cannot get along with each other but also cannot adapt to secular Britain\". This conflict is shown throughout the collection, usually when an Indian or Pakistani woman is acting as a patient for Dalrymple, who then extracts the story for why the person is there. However, there are only a few stories told from the perspective of Indian Sikhs and Pakistani Muslims since the majority of the patients and prisoners that Dalrymple interviews are white.\n\nMeic Pearse of \"Third Way\" magazine described the style of the collection as \"funny yet depressing, easy to read yet extremely profound.\" \"Publishers Weekly\" considered the writing to be \"graceful and often witty\", although the \"main points get hammered home too quickly and too often\". Doctor D. of the \"National Review\" considered the style to be \"extraordinary\", with \"clear and penetrating prose\" that was \"always fearless for the truth\". James R. Otteson, in his novel \"Actual Ethics\", spoke of how Dalrymple \"does not employ the facts and figures\", but \"relies instead on his anecdotal experience\". This, however, allows the \"patterns [to] crystallize with pellucid clarity [very clear, transparently clear]\".\n\n\"Life at the Bottom\" has received mostly positive reviews. Gregory Schneider of the \"Topeka Capital-Journal\" called the collection \"the best exploration of the problems of poverty ever written.\" \"America\" magazine writer, Peter Heinegg, considered the essays to be a \"barrage of breathtakingly horrible true-life...stories\", but he said that Dalrymple puts too much of his personal \"snorting indignation\" into the text without letting the reader draw their own conclusions. He ended by saying, \"Dalrymple's case sounds like a paranoid tirade or perverse tribute, but it is at least partially redeemed by the barrage of breathtakingly horrible true-life (one assumes) stories that this very angry doctor tells...to bolster it.\" John Clark of \"Liberty\" magazine called it \"so compelling...that I read it cover to cover in a day's time—and later reread it twice.\"\n\nThomas Sowell, a pundit and social critic, described it as \"brilliant and insightful\" in \"Capitalism\" magazine and \"an insightful and devastating eyewitness account of the white underclass in Britain\" in the \"Jewish World Review\". Overall, Sowell said that the collection was able to explain that \"One of the most telling examples of the social destructiveness of the left's welfare-state vision can be found among the white slum dwellers in Britain.\" \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" writer, Theresa K. Weaver, called the collection \"saddening, infuriating, and ultimately not terribly empowering\", stating that she wishes Dalrymple \"might at least offer a few ideas on turning everything around.\" Arthur Foulkes of the \"Carolina Journal\" described it as a \"fine book\" that \"offers much to friends of liberty everywhere.\" Roger Donway of \"The Atlas Society\" considered it to be \"one of the most instructive books that I have read in many years\". Stephen Goode, writing for \"Insight on the News\", said that the collection argued its \"position brilliantly and with impressive passion\". The \"National Observer\" wrote that it \"has much value\", if it is taken as an \"antidote to fashionable loose thinking\".\n\n\n"}

H. White said a propos the bestiary he translated. \"Things did not only have a moral they often had physical counterparts in other strata. There was a horse in the land and a sea-horse in the sea. For that matter there was probably a Pegasus in heaven\". The idea of perfect analogies in the fauna of land and sea was considered part of the perfect symmetry of the Creator's plan, offered as the \"book of nature\" to mankind, for which a text could be found in \"Job\":\nBut ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you. Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this? In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.\n\nThe idea appears in the Jewish Tannaic sources as well, as brought down in Babylonian Talmud, Chulin 127a. Rashi (Psalms 49:2) traces this to a biblical source – the land is referred to as \"Chaled\", from the weasel (chulda), because the weasel is the only animal on dry land that does not have its counterpart in the sea.\nAll of Creation was considered to reflect the Creator, and Man could learn about the Creator through studying the Creation, an assumption that underlies the \"watchmaker analogy\" offered as a proof of God's existence.\n\nThe correspondence between the realms of earth and sea, extending to its denizens, offers examples of the taste for allegory engendered by Christian and Islamic methods of exegesis, which also encouraged the doctrine of signatures, a \"key\" to the meaning and use of herbs.\n\nThe source text that was most influential in compiling the bestiaries of the 12th and 13th centuries was the \"Physiologus\", one of the most widely read and copied secular texts of the Middle Ages. Written in Greek in Alexandria the 2nd century CE and accumulating further \"exemplary\" beasts in the next three centuries and more, \"Physiologus\" was transmitted in the West in Latin, and eventually translated into many vernacular languages: many manuscripts in various languages survive.\nAelian, \"On the Characteristics of Animals\" (A. F. Scholfield, in Loeb Classical Library, 1958).\n\nChristian writers, trained in anagogical thinking and expecting to find spiritual instruction inherent in the processes of Nature, disregarded the caveat in Pliny's Natural History, where the idea is presented as a \"vulgar opinion\": \n\nHence it is that the vulgar notion may very possibly be true, that whatever is produced in any other department of Nature, is to be found in the sea as well; while, at the same time, many other productions are there to be found which nowhere else exist. That there are to be found in the sea the forms, not only of terrestrial animals, but of inanimate objects even, is easily to be understood by all who will take the trouble to examine the grape-fish, the sword-fish, the sawfish, and the cucumber-fish, which last so strongly resembles the real cucumber both in colour and in smell.\nPliny points out that many more things are found in the sea than on the land, and also mentions the correspondences that may be discovered between many non-living objects of the land and living creatures in the sea. \n\nSaint Augustine of Hippo reasons based on analogy, that since there is a serpent in the grass, there must be an eel in the sea; because there is a Leviathan in the sea, there must be a Behemoth on the land. (\"City of God\"? xi.15?)\nThe reaction to such anagogical thinking set in with the unfolding of critical scientific thought in the 17th century. Sir Thomas Browne devoted a chapter of his \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\" to dispelling such a belief: Chapter XXIV: \"That all Animals in the land are in their kinde in the Sea.\" During the Enlightenment the ancient conception was given an innovative and rationalized cast by Benoît de Maillet in describing the transformations and metamorphoses undergone by creatures of the sea to render them fit for life on land, a proto-evolutionist concept, though it was based on superficial morphological similarities:\nThere are in the Sea, Fish of almost all the Figures of Land-Animals, and even of Birds. She includes Plants, Flowers, and some Fruits; the Nettle, the Rose, the Pink, the Melon and the Grape, are to be found there.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the Quadrupeds, we not only find in the Sea, Species of the same Figure and Inclinations, and in the Waves living on the same Aliments by which they are nourished on Land, we have also Examples of those Species living equally in the Air and in the Water. Have not the Sea-Apes precisely the same figure with those of the Land?\n\nThough in \"Moby-Dick\" Ishmael, with a nod to Sir Thomas Browne's wording, denies the claim that land animals find their counterparts in the sea,For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.\nin discussing dolphins trained to aid scuba divers, a 1967 \"Popular Mechanics\" article could still casually state: \"It's hoped that the marine counterparts of some land animals can be trained to become useful members of the Man-in-the-Sea program.\"\n"}
{"id": "363286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=363286", "title": "Maximum sustainable yield", "text": "Maximum sustainable yield\n\nIn population ecology and economics, maximum sustainable yield or MSY is theoretically, the largest yield (or catch) that can be taken from a species' stock over an indefinite period. Fundamental to the notion of sustainable harvest, the concept of MSY aims to maintain the population size at the point of maximum growth rate by harvesting the individuals that would normally be added to the population, allowing the population to continue to be productive indefinitely. Under the assumption of logistic growth, resource limitation does not constrain individuals' reproductive rates when populations are small, but because there are few individuals, the overall yield is small. At intermediate population densities, also represented by half the carrying capacity, individuals are able to breed to their maximum rate. At this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, there is a surplus of individuals that can be harvested because growth of the population is at its maximum point due to the large number of reproducing individuals. Above this point, density dependent factors increasingly limit breeding until the population reaches carrying capacity. At this point, there are no surplus individuals to be harvested and yield drops to zero. The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the optimum sustainable yield and maximum economic yield.\n\nMSY is extensively used for fisheries management. Unlike the logistic (Schaefer) model, MSY has been refined in most modern fisheries models and occurs at around 30% of the unexploited population size. This fraction differs among populations depending on the life history of the species and the age-specific selectivity of the fishing method.\n\nHowever, the approach has been widely criticized as ignoring several key factors involved in fisheries management and has led to the devastating collapse of many fisheries. As a simple calculation, it ignores the size and age of the animal being taken, its reproductive status, and it focuses solely on the species in question, ignoring the damage to the ecosystem caused by the designated level of exploitation and the issue of bycatch. Among conservation biologists it is widely regarded as dangerous and misused.\n\nThe concept of MSY as a fisheries management strategy developed in Belmar, New Jersey, in the early 1930s. It increased in popularity in the 1950s with the advent of surplus-production models with explicitly estimate MSY. As an apparently simple and logical management goal, combined with the lack of other simple management goals of the time, MSY was adopted as the primary management goal by several international organizations (e.g., IWC, IATTC, ICCAT, ICNAF), and individual countries.\n\nBetween 1949 and 1955, the U.S. maneuvered to have MSY declared the goal of international fisheries management (Johnson 2007). The international MSY treaty that was eventually adopted in 1955 gave foreign fleets the right to fish off any coast. Nations that wanted to exclude foreign boats had to first prove that its fish were overfished.\n\nAs experience was gained with the model, it became apparent to some researchers that it lacked the capability to deal with the real world operational complexities and the influence of trophic and other interactions. In 1977, Peter Larkin wrote its epitaph, challenging the goal of maximum sustained yield on several grounds: It put populations at too much risk; it did not account for spatial variability in productivity; it did not account for species other than the focus of the fishery; it considered only the benefits, not the costs, of fishing; and it was sensitive to political pressure. In fact, none of these criticisms was aimed at sustainability as a goal. The first one noted that seeking the absolute MSY with uncertain parameters was risky. The rest point out that the goal of MSY was not holistic; it left out too many relevant features.\n\nSome managers began to use more conservative quota recommendations, but the influence of the MSY model for fisheries management still prevailed. Even while the scientific community was beginning to question the appropriateness and effectiveness of MSY as a management goal, it was incorporated into the 1982 United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea, thus ensuring its integration into national and international fisheries acts and laws. According to Walters and Maguire, an ‘‘institutional juggernaut had been set in motion’’, climaxing in the early 1990s with the collapse of northern cod.\n\nThe key assumption behind all sustainable harvesting models such as MSY is that populations of organisms grow and replace themselves – that is, they are renewable resources. Additionally it is assumed that because the growth rates, survival rates, and reproductive rates increase when harvesting reduces population density, they produce a surplus of biomass that can be harvested. Otherwise, sustainable harvest would not be possible.\n\nAnother assumption of renewable resource harvesting is that populations of organisms do not continue to grow indefinitely; they reach an equilibrium population size, which occurs when the number of individuals matches the resources available to the population (i.e., assume classic logistic growth). At this equilibrium population size, called the carrying capacity, the population remains at a stable size.\n\nThe logistic model (or logistic function) is a function that is used to describe bounded population growth under the previous two assumptions. The logistic function is bounded at both extremes: when there are not individuals to reproduce, and when there is an equilibrium number of individuals (i.e., at carrying capacity). Under the logistic model, population growth rate between these two limits is most often assumed to be sigmoidal (Figure 1). There is scientific evidence that some populations do grow in a logistic fashion towards a stable equilibrium – a commonly cited example is the logistic growth of yeast.\n\nThe equation describing logistic growth is:\n\nThe parameter values are:\n\nFrom the logistic function, the population size at any point can be calculated as long as formula_5, formula_3, and formula_4 are known.\n\nDifferentiating equation 1.1 give an expression for how the rate of population increases as N increases. At first, the population growth rate is fast, but it begins to slow as the population grows until it levels off to the maximum growth rate, after which it begins to decrease (figure 2).\n\nThe equation for figure 2 is the differential of equation 1.1 (Verhulst's 1838 ):\n\nformula_10 can be understood as the change in population (N) with respect to a change in time (t). Equation 1.2 is the usual way in which logistic growth is represented mathematically and has several important features. First, at very low population sizes, the value of formula_11 is small, so the population growth rate is approximately equal to formula_12, meaning the population is growing exponentially at a rate r (the intrinsic rate of population increase). Despite this, the population growth rate is very low (low values on the y-axis of figure 2) because, even though each individual is reproducing at a high rate, there are few reproducing individuals present. Conversely, when the population is large the value of formula_11 approaches 1 effectively reducing the terms inside the brackets of equation 1.2 to zero. The effect is that the population growth rate is again very low, because either each individual is hardly reproducing or mortality rates are high. As a result of these two extremes, the population growth rate is maximum at an intermediate population or half the carrying capacity (formula_14).\n\nThe simplest way to model harvesting is to modify the logistic equation so that a certain number of individuals is continuously removed:\n\nWhere H represents the number of individuals being removed from the population – that is, the harvesting rate. When H is constant, the population will be at equilibrium when the number of individuals being removed is equal to the population growth rate (figure 3). The equilibrium population size under a particular harvesting regime can be found when the population is not growing – that is, when formula_16. This occurs when the population growth rate is the same as the harvest rate:\n\nFigure 3 shows how growth rate varies with population density. For low densities (far from carrying capacity), there is little addition (or \"recruitment\") to the population, simply because there are few organisms to give birth. At high densities, though, there is intense competition for resources, and growth rate is again low because the death rate is high. In between these two extremes, the population growth rate rises to a maximum value (formula_18). This maximum point represents the maximum number of individuals that can be added to a population by natural processes. If more individuals than this are removed from the population, the population is at risk for decline to extinction. The maximum number that can be harvested in a sustainable manner, called the maximum sustainable yield, is given by this maximum point.\n\nFigure 3 also shows several possible values for the harvesting rate, H. At formula_19, there are two possible population equilibrium points: a low population size (formula_20) and a high one (formula_21). At formula_22, a slightly higher harvest rate, however there is only one equilibrium point (at formula_18), which is the population size that produces the maximum growth rate. With logistic growth, this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, is where the population size is half the carrying capacity (or formula_24). The maximum sustainable yield is the largest yield that can be taken from a population at equilibrium.\nIn figure 3, if formula_25 is higher than formula_22, the harvesting would exceed the population's capacity to replace itself at any population size (formula_27 in figure 3). Because harvesting rate is higher than the population growth rate at all values of formula_28, this rate of harvesting is not sustainable.\n\nAn important feature of the MSY model is how harvested populations respond to environmental fluctuations or illegal offtake. Consider a population at formula_21 harvested at a constant harvest level formula_19. If the population falls (due to a bad winter or illegal harvest) this will ease density-dependent population regulation and increase yield, moving the population back to formula_21, a stable equilibrium. In this case, a negative feedback loop creates stability. The lower equilibrium point for the constant harvest level formula_19 is not stable however; a population crash or illegal harvesting will decrease population yield farther below the current harvest level, creating a positive feedback loop leading to extinction. Harvesting at formula_33 is also potentially unstable. A small decrease in the population can lead to a positive feedback loop and extinction if the harvesting regime (formula_22) is not reduced. Thus, some consider harvesting at MSY to be unsafe on ecological and economic grounds. The MSY model itself can be modified to harvest a certain percentage of the population or with constant effort constraints rather than an actual number, thereby avoiding some of its instabilities.\n\nThe MSY equilibrium point is semi-stable – a small increase in population size is compensated for, a small decrease to extinction if H is not decreased. Harvesting at MSY is therefore dangerous because it is on a knife-edge – any small population decline leads to a positive feedback, with the population declining rapidly to extinction if the number of harvested stays the same.\n\nThe formula for maximum sustained harvest (formula_25) is one-fourth the maximum population or carrying capacity (formula_36) times the intrinsic rate of growth (formula_37).\n\nformula_38\n\nThe principle of MSY often holds for age-structured populations as well. The calculations can be more complicated, and the results often depend on whether density dependence occurs in the larval stage (often modeled as density dependent reproduction) and/or other life stages. It has been shown that if density dependence only acts on larva, then there is an optimal life stage (size or age class) to harvest, with no harvest of all other life stages. Hence the optimal strategy is to harvest this most valuable life-stage at MSY. However, in age and stage-structured models, a constant MSY does not always exist. In such cases, cyclic harvest is optimal where the yield and resource fluctuate in size, through time. In addition, environmental stochasticity interacts with demographically structured populations in fundamentally different ways than for unstructured populations when determining optimal harvest. In fact, the optimal biomass to be left in the ocean, when fished at MSY, can be either higher or lower than in analogous deterministic models, depending on the details of the density dependent recruitment function, if stage-structure is also included in the model.\n\nStarting to harvest a previously unharvested population will always lead to a decrease in the population size. That is, it is impossible for a harvested population to remain at its original carrying capacity. Instead, the population will either stabilize at a new lower equilibrium size or, if the harvesting rate is too high, decline to zero.\n\nThe reason why populations can be sustainably harvested is that they exhibit a density-dependent response. This means that at any population size below K, the population is producing a surplus yield that is available for harvesting without reducing population size. Density dependence is the regulator process that allows the population to return to equilibrium after a perturbation. The logistic equation assumes that density dependence takes the form of negative feedback.\n\nIf a constant number of individuals is harvested from a population at a level greater than the MSY, the population will decline to extinction. Harvesting below the MSY level leads to a stable equilibrium population if the starting population is above the unstable equilibrium population size.\n\nMSY has been especially influential in the management of renewable biological resources such as commercially important fish and wildlife. In fisheries terms, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is the largest average catch that can be captured from a stock under existing environmental conditions. MSY aims at a balance between too much and too little harvest to keep the population at some intermediate abundance with a maximum replacement rate.\n\nRelating to MSY, the maximum economic yield (MEY) is the level of catch that provides the maximum net economic benefits or profits to society. Like optimum sustainable yield, MEY is usually less than MSY.\n\nAlthough it is widely practiced by state and federal government agencies regulating wildlife, forests, and fishing, MSY has come under heavy criticism by ecologists and others from both theoretical and practical reasons. The concept of maximum sustainable yield is not always easy to apply in practice. Estimation problems arise due to poor assumptions in some models and lack of reliability of the data. Biologists, for example, do not always have enough data to make a clear determination of the population's size and growth rate. Calculating the point at which a population begins to slow from competition is also very difficult. The concept of MSY also tends to treat all individuals in the population as identical, thereby ignoring all aspects of population structure such as size or age classes and their differential rates of growth, survival, and reproduction.\n\nAs a management goal, the static interpretation of MSY (i.e., MSY as a fixed catch that can be taken year after year) is generally not appropriate because it ignores the fact that fish populations undergo natural fluctuations (i.e., MSY treats the environment as unvarying) in abundance and will usually ultimately become severely depleted under a constant-catch strategy. Thus, most fisheries scientists now interpret MSY in a more dynamic sense as the maximum average yield (MAY) obtained by applying a specific harvesting strategy to a fluctuating resource. Or as an optimal \"escapement strategy\", where escapement means the amount of fish that must remain in the ocean [rather than the amount of fish that can be harvested]. An escapement strategy is often the optimal strategy for maximizing expected yield of a harvested, stochastically fluctuating population.\n\nHowever, the limitations of MSY, does not mean it performs worse than humans using their best intuitive judgment. Experiments using students in natural resource management classes suggest that people using their past experience, intuition, and best judgement to manage a fishery generate far less long term yield compared to a computer using an MSY calculation, even when that calculation comes from incorrect population dynamic models.\n\nFor a more contemporary description of MSY and its calculation see \n\nAn example of errors in estimating the population dynamics of a species occurred within the New Zealand Orange roughy fishery. Early quotas were based on an assumption that the orange roughy had a fairly short lifespan and bred relatively quickly. However, it was later discovered that the orange roughy lived a long time and had bred slowly (~30 years). By this stage stocks had been largely depleted.\n\nAll around the world, from the arctic to the tropics, there is a crisis in the world's fisheries. Until fairly recently it was assumed that our marine resources were limitless.\n\nIn recent years however, an accelerating decline has been observed in the productivity of many important fisheries. Fisheries which have been devastated in recent times include (but are not limited to) the great whale fisheries, the Grand Bank fisheries of the western Atlantic, and the Peruvian anchovy fishery. Recent assessments by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the state of the world's fisheries indicate a levelling off of landings in the 1990s, at about 100 million tons.\n\nIn addition, the composition of global catches has changed. As fishers deplete larger, long-lived predatory fish species such as cod, tuna, shark, and snapper, they move down to the next level – to species that tend to be smaller, shorter-lived, and less valuable.\n\nOverfishing is a classic example of the tragedy of the commons.\n\nIn population ecology and economics, optimum sustainable yield is the level of effort (LOE) that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost. Or, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This level of effort maximizes the economic profit, or rent, of the resource being utilized. It usually corresponds to an effort level lower than that of maximum sustainable yield.\nIn environmental science, optimum sustainable yield is the largest economical yield of a renewable resource achievable over a long time period without decreasing the ability of the population or its environment to support the continuation of this level of yield.\n\n\n"}

The equation was first proposed by French mathematician and music theorist Marin Mersenne in his 1637 work \"Traité de l'harmonie universelle\". Mersenne's laws govern the construction and operation of string instruments, such as pianos and harps, which must accommodate the total tension force required to keep the strings at the proper pitch. Lower strings are thicker, thus having a greater mass per unit length. They typically have lower tension. Guitars are a familiar exception to this - string tensions are similar, for playability, so lower string pitch is largely achieved with increased mass per length. Higher-pitched strings typically are thinner, have higher tension, and may be shorter. \"This result does not differ substantially from Galileo's, yet it is rightly known as Mersenne's law,\" because Mersenne physically proved their truth through experiments (while Galileo considered their proof impossible). \"Mersenne investigated and refined these relationships by experiment but did not himself originate them\". Though his theories are correct, his measurements are not very exact, and his calculations were greatly improved by Joseph Sauveur (1653–1716) through the use of acoustic beats and metronomes.\n\nThe fundamental frequency is:\n\n\nThus, for example, all other properties of the string being equal, to make the note one octave higher (2/1) one would need either to decrease its length by half (1/2), to increase the tension to the square (4), or to decrease its mass per unit length by the inverse square (1/4).\nThese laws are derived from Mersenne's equation 22:\n\nThe formula for the fundamental frequency is:\n\nwhere \"f\" is the frequency, \"L\" is the length, \"F\" is the force and \"μ\" is the mass per unit length.\n\nSimilar laws were not developed for pipes and wind instruments at the same time since Mersenne's laws predate the conception of wind instrument pitch being dependent on longitudinal waves rather than \"percussion\".\n\n"}

In 2010 he became a registered yoga teacher with a 200-Hour Level certification from Power Yoga Works recognized by Yoga Alliance. Later that year he trained with Street Yoga to teach yoga and mindfulness to at-risk youth and vulnerable populations. He has since trained at the Kripalu Yoga Center, Omega Institute for Holistic Studies, the Prison Yoga Project, Power Yoga Works, and other organizations to gain additional skills as a teacher, including for incarcerated populations and veterans.\n\nHuggins studied Accounting at Villanova University and received an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He has worked as a Senior Auditor at Arthur Andersen and Co., Manager of Treasury Operations for Kenner Parker Toys, Vice President of Administration for Town & County Corp., CFO/COO for Spectra Science, President and COO for Synthes, Inc., CEO for Scient’x, and most recently as a Consultant for MDH Advisors.\n\nIn July 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Synthes and a subsidiary with various offenses relating to a bone cement regulated by the federal government as a medical device. The government also charged four company executives, including Michael Huggins, with a strict liability misdemeanor offense. After pleading guilty to the strict liability misdemeanor charge, Huggins was sentenced in November 2011 to a nine-month prison term, a $100,000 fine, and three months of supervised release following his release from custody.\n\nIn 2010, Huggins began working with community organizations to provide yoga to at-risk youth, and as after-school programming for young people. During his first weeks in prison Huggins began teaching yoga and guided meditation to his fellow inmates. The popularity of his teaching spurred him to train fellow inmates as teachers also. After his release from prison, Huggins attended a Prison Yoga Project training course and soon after began returning to prisons as a volunteer yoga instructor. Huggins found that yoga could be a therapy and build emotional tools against the traumas of living in prison as well as the traumas that came before incarceration, such as homelessness, drug abuse, and domestic violence. In 2013, Huggins founded Transformation Yoga Project as a non-profit organization with a mission to train and provide teachers with yoga and mindfulness techniques that specifically support people with traumatic or addictive backgrounds in an effort to heal, build emotional stability, and reduce the stresses of imprisoned, rehabilitative, post-traumatic, or transitional living circumstances. Transformation Yoga Project encourages the yoga teachers it trains to embrace seva, the religious concept of serving selflessly. The goals of Transformation Yoga Project include curbing recidivism rates by enabling inmates to heal, develop greater maturity, and create positive growth for themselves. Many within prison administrations embrace yoga and mindfulness programs because of the benefits to the inmate populations during and after incarceration.\n\nTransformation Yoga Project runs programs in numerous facilities including at the State Correctional Institute at Graterford, the Philadelphia Prison System’s Cambria Community Center, the Montgomery County Youth Detention Center, the Montgomery County Youth Shelter, the Delaware County Juvenile Detention Center, the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia, the Kirkbride Center for recovery, Gaudenzia house, the Divine Light Recovery House, the ODDAT Synergy House, and at the Veterans Hospital in Coatesville, Pennsylvania.\n\nHuggins works with several non-profit organizations in a variety of capacities, including sharing yoga with at-risk and traumatized populations throughout the country. He has partnered with Prison Yoga Project to train yoga teachers. He sits on the Board of Directors of Liberation Prison Yoga, a non-profit organization founded by Anneke Lucas, to prepare yoga teachers with trauma-conscious methods for incarcerated people. He has also volunteered with the United Way of Chester County and Open Hearth where he taught career development workshops for the underprivileged.\n"}

A commutative monoid on which a monus operator is defined is called a commutative monoid with monus, or CMM. The monus operator may be denoted with the − symbol because the natural numbers are a CMM under subtraction; it is also denoted with the ∸ symbol to distinguish it from the standard subtraction operator.\n\nLet formula_1 be a commutative monoid. Define a binary relation formula_2 on this monoid as follows: for any two elements formula_3. and formula_4, we set formula_5 if and only if there exists another element formula_6 such that formula_7. It is easy to check that formula_2 is reflexive (taking formula_6 to be the neutral element of the monoid) and that it is transitive (if formula_5 with witness formula_11 and formula_12 with witness formula_13 then formula_14 witnesses that formula_15). We call formula_16 \"naturally ordered\" if the formula_2 relation is additionally antisymmetric, so that formula_2 is a partial order. Further, if for each pair of elements formula_3 and formula_4, there exists a unique smallest element formula_6 such that formula_22, then we call a \"commutative monoid with monus\"\nand we can then define the \"monus\" of any two elements formula_3 and formula_4 as this unique smallest element formula_6 such that formula_22.\n\nAn example of a commutative monoid which is not naturally ordered is formula_27, the commutative monoid of the integers with usual addition, as for any formula_28 there exists formula_6 such that formula_7, so we have formula_5 for any formula_28, so formula_2 is not a partial order. There are also examples of monoids which are naturally ordered but are not semirings with monus.\n\nBeyond monoids, the notion of monus can be applied to other structures. For instance, a naturally ordered semiring (sometimes called a dioid) is a semiring where the commutative monoid induced by the addition operator is naturally ordered. When this monoid is a commutative monoid with monus, the semiring is called a semiring with monus, or m-semiring.\n\nIf is an ideal in a Boolean algebra, then is a commutative monoid with monus under and .\n\nThe natural numbers including 0 form a commutative monoid with monus, with their ordering being the usual order of natural numbers and the monus operator being a saturating variant of standard subtraction, variously referred to as truncated subtraction, limited subtraction, proper subtraction, and monus. Truncated subtraction is usually defined as\nwhere − denotes standard subtraction. For example, 5 − 3 = 2 and 3 − 5 = −2 in regular subtraction, whereas in truncated subtraction 3 ∸ 5 = 0. Truncated subtraction may also be defined as\n\nIn Peano arithmetic, truncated subtraction is defined in terms of the predecessor function (the inverse of the successor function):\n\nTruncated subtraction is useful in contexts such as primitive recursive functions, which are not defined over negative numbers. Truncated subtraction is also used in the definition of the multiset difference operator.\n\nThe class of all commutative monoids with monus form a variety. The equational basis for the variety of all CMMs consists of the axioms for commutative monoids, as well as the following axioms:\n\nformula_37\n"}

Both ways use generalizations (for instance, inheritance or delegate functions) to resolve the apparent dilemma, but the goals, techniques, and results are different.\n\nBertrand Meyer is generally credited for having originated the term \"open/closed principle\", which appeared in his 1988 book \"Object Oriented Software Construction\". \n\nAt the time Meyer was writing, adding fields or functions to a library inevitably required changes to any programs depending on that library. Meyer's proposed solution to this dilemma relied on the notion of object-oriented inheritance (specifically implementation inheritance):\nA class is closed, since it may be compiled, stored in a library, baselined, and used by client classes. But it is also open, since any new class may use it as parent, adding new features. When a descendant class is defined, there is no need to change the original or to disturb its clients.\nDuring the 1990s, the open/closed principle became popularly redefined to refer to the use of abstracted interfaces, where the implementations can be changed and multiple implementations could be created and polymorphically substituted for each other.\n\nIn contrast to Meyer's usage, this definition advocates inheritance from abstract base classes. Interface specifications can be reused through inheritance but implementation need not be. The existing interface is closed to modifications and new implementations must, at a minimum, implement that interface.\n\nRobert C. Martin's 1996 article \"The Open-Closed Principle\" was one of the seminal writings to take this approach. In 2001 Craig Larman related the open/closed principle to the pattern by Alistair Cockburn called \"Protected Variations\", and to the David Parnas discussion of \"information hiding\".\n\n\n"}

The method aims to support personal change and self development. \n\nDuring his time as Professor of Philosophy at the University of Miami, Painter became interested in working with the body and personally explored many different approaches – massage, acupuncture, Zen, yoga, the work of Ida Rolf and her Rolfing method, Gestalt therapy developed by Fritz Perls, and the theories of Wilhelm Reich in the form of Vegetotherapy.\n\nBy the seventies he was calling his form of holistic bodymind bodywork 'Postural Integration'. In the eighties and nineties Painter then went on to develop two further methods, Energetic Integration and Pelvic-Heart Integration.\n\nIn the course of a twelve-session series modeled loosely on Rolfing Structural Integration, the Postural Integration process integrates Gestalt therapy with bodywork, as well as breath work, fine energy work and elements from the Five Phases system. The initial seven sessions address specific body areas and focus on releasing defensive armoring habits, characterized as \"letting go of the old self\". During sessions, spontaneous emotional expression is encouraged. Additional tools include drama therapy, attention to body language and self-awareness.\n\nSince Postural Integration works simultaneously with the physical, mental and emotional aspects of the whole person, it contains elements of both psychotherapy and bodywork, some practitioners qualified in psychotherapy focus more on the therapy aspect while others use it primarily as a form of bodywork with psychotherapy-based awareness and insights.\n\nPostural Integration is taught and practised mainly in Europe, and also in US, Mexico and South Africa. \n\nPostural Integration trainings are organized by the International Council of PsychoCorporal (Bodymind) Integration Trainers (ICPIT).\n\nIn the 1990s Postural Integrational Psychotherapy (PIP) developed in Europe out of Postural Integration with the inclusion of Jungian psychology, and was acknowledged by the European Association for Body Psychotherapy as a method of Body psychotherapy provided the practitioner is also a qualified psychotherapist.\n\n\n"}

The Nyaya School recognizes \"Pratyaksha\" (perception) as a kind of \"pramana\" along with \"Anumana\" (inference), \"Upamana\" (comparison) and Shabda (verbal testimony); this school recognizes these four kinds only. The Sankhya School does not recognize \"Upamana\" as a \"pramana\". To these four auxiliaries which help illuminate things the Vedantins and the Mimamsakas also add \"Anupalabdhi\" (non-apprehension) and \"Arthapatti\" (presumption)as valid \"pramanas\".\n\n\"Pratyaksha\" is one of the three principal means of knowledge. The three principal means of knowledge are – 1) \"Anumana\", inference from data, which depends for its value on the possession of the right data, on the right observation of the data including the drawing of the right analogies, the unerring perception of true identity and rejection of false identity, the just estimate of difference and contrast, and on the power of right reasoning from the right data; 2) \"Pratyaksha\" which is the process of collecting and knowing the data, and 3) \"Aptavakya\" which is evidence, the testimony of men in possession of the sought after knowledge.\n\n\"Pratyaksha\" refers to the faculties of perception with which are connected thoughts (\"Chinta\"), imagination (\"Kalpana\") and volition (\"Praytna\"), which four together as \"Chetas\" illuminate the \"Manas\", the ordinary mental equipment of the individual, and give awareness or consciousness (\"Chetna\"). There are four types of valid perceptions – a) \"Indriya pratyaksha\" or sense perception, b) \"Manas pratyaksha\" or mental perception, c) \"Svavedana pratyaksha\" or self-consciousness, and d) \"Yoga pratyaksha\" or super normal intuition. In sense perception, which is an indeterminate perception the \"chittashakti\" (intelligence-energy) acts as the substratum of the senses. Mental perception arises when \"chittashakti\", with the aid of \"Buddhi\", reflects upon objects of senses, and is a determinate perception. Self-consciousness arises when, directed by the \"tattvas\" or \"panchakoshas\", \"raga\" (attachment), \"vidya\" (knowledge), \"niyati\" (order of things), \"kala\" (time) and \"kalpa\" (the elements) along with pleasure and pain become objects of knowledge to chit, the intelligence of the self. Super normal intuition is gained after removal of impurities cover the intelligent-self through practice of the eight-fold yogic-discipline.\n\n\"Pratyaksha\" knowledge can be gained through a) Worldly pratyaksha, externally through the five senses and internally through mind, and b) Transcendental \"pratyaksha\" which is divided into \"Samanya\", \"Lakshana\", \"Gyana lakshana\" and \"Yogaja\". \"Pratyaksha\" (apparent or obvious) is divided into \"Savikalpa\", \"Nirvikalpa\" and \"Pratibhigya\". \"Pratyaksha\" knowledge is intuitive in nature and in Yoga and Vedanta is also known as Aparokshanubhuti.\n"}

It is on this presumption our common adage is based: \"Possession is nine points of the law\". Presumption has its place in canon law only when positive proofs are wanting, and yet the formulation of some judgment is necessary. It is never in itself an absolute proof, as it only presumes that something is true. Canonists divide presumption into:\n\nCanon 1584 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law defines the current canonical jurisprudence around presumption:\n\nThis canon of the 1983 Code removes the distinction between relative and absolute legal presumption that was present in the 1917 Code of Canon Law.\n\nThere are several sub-varieties of presumption of law. The foundation of these legal presumptions is to be sought in the natural conclusions drawn from the ordinary happenings of common life and the consideration of the motives that usually sway men in given circumstances. The general rules are thus formulated: \"What is natural is presumed to be in the person or case in question\"; \"Change is not to be presumed\"; \"Presumption is to be formed from the favourable side\". As to effects, when there is question of presumption \"juris,\" it abstracts from the necessity of proof; not so presumption \"hominis.\" A judge can follow the first in civil cases even when doubt remains, not so the second. The former places the burden of proof on the adversary, but the latter does not. Finally, the first is considered of itself equivalent to proof, while the second needs corroboration from something extraneous to itself.\n\nA legal presumption (\"presumptio juris\") is a presumption that is stated in the positive canon law (\"ab ipsa lege\"). Under the 1917 Code of Canon Law, legal presumption was divided into two kinds: \"juris tantum\" \"which is relative and vincible by both direct and indirect proof to the contrary\", and \"juris et de jure\" or absolute presumption which can only be refuted by indirect proof (undermining the fact(s) upon which the presumption is based). This distinction between the subdivisions of legal presumption, the relative (\"juris simpliciter\") and the absolute (\"juris et de jure\") was not continued into the 1983 Code of Canon Law and was dropped.\n\nThus, it is called presumption of law alone (\"juris tantum\") when a thing is judged to be so until the contrary is proved. Hence the legal formulæ: \"Everyone is presumed innocent until his guilt is proved\"; \"Once bad always bad\" (i. e. in the same species of ill-doing, if amendment is not certain); \"What is known in a remote place is known in a neighbouring place\", and others similar.\n\nIt is denominated presumption \"juris et de jure,\" when the law so strongly supports the presumption that it is held to be certain in judicial proceedings. Against such a presumption no proofs are admitted except the evident truth. Thus, goods described in the inventory made by a guardian are presumed to belong to the possessions of the deceased, nor would the later testimony of the guardian himself to the contrary ordinarily be admitted.\n\nNatural presumptions (\"presumptiones juris naturales\") fall under the definition of \"presumptio hominis\". According to a generally held opinion of canonists, \"presumptions \"hominis\" and \"naturae\" are, in as far as they are moral, in contrast to presumptions \"juris\" or legal presumptions.\"\n\nPresumptions of the natural law are those presumptions that are not stated in the positive canon law, and as such do not constitute \"legal\" presumptions. Some presumptions of the natural law have been incorporated into the \"Rules of Law\". Sometimes judges use natural law presumptions as their basis for judicial presumptions.\n\nAs to the presumption \"judicis\" or \"hominis\", it is denoted by the following:\n\n"}

An outcome of globalization and free trade, the phenomenon may occur when competition increases between geographic areas over a particular sector of trade and production. The principal effect and intent of these actions is to make labor rates \"more competitive\" (i.e. lower), the principal cost of business, together with other factors (pensions, environmental protection and other externalities), and thus the metaphor where the bottom is the lowest wage that can be paid for that labor.\n\nThe concept of a regulatory \"race to the bottom\" emerged in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th century, when there was charter competition among states to attract corporations to domicile in their jurisdiction. Some described the concept as the \"race to efficiency\", and others, such as Justice Louis Brandeis, as the \"race to the bottom\".\n\nIn the late 19th century, joint-stock company control was being liberalised in Europe, where countries were engaged in competitive liberal legislation to allow local companies to compete. This liberalization reached Spain in 1869, Germany in 1870, Belgium in 1873, and Italy in 1883. In 1890, New Jersey enacted a liberal corporation charter, which charged low fees for company registration and lower franchise taxes than other states. Delaware attempted to copy the law to attract companies to its own state. This competition ended when Governor Woodrow Wilson tightened New Jersey's laws through a series of seven statutes.\n\nIn academic literature, the phenomenon of regulatory competition reducing standards overall was argued for by A.A. Berle and G.C. Means in \"The Modern Corporation and Private Property\" (1932), while the concept received formal recognition by the US Supreme Court in a decision of Justice Louis Brandeis in the 1933 case \"Ligget Co. v. Lee\" (288 U.S. 517, 558–559).\n\nBrandeis's \"race to the bottom\" metaphor was updated in 1974 by William Cary, in an article in the Yale Law Journal, \"Federalism and Corporate Law: Reflections Upon Delaware,\" in which Carey argued for the imposition of national standards for corporate governance.\n\nSanford F. Schram explained in 2000 that the term \"race to the bottom\":\n\nThe term has also been used to describe a similar type of competition between corporations. In 2003, in response to reports that British supermarkets had cut the price of bananas, and by implication had squeezed revenues of banana-growing developing nations, Alistair Smith, international co-coordinator of Banana Link, said \"The British supermarkets are leading a race to the bottom. Jobs are being lost and producers are having to pay less attention to social and environmental agreements.\"\n\nAnother example is the cruise industry, which registers its ship with flags of convenience, circumventing wage requirements, and other expenses required by developed countries, thus providing the business model for the industry.\n\nThe term has also been used in the context of a trend for some European states to seize refugees' assets.\n\nThe race to the bottom has been a tactic widely used among states within the United States of America. The race to the bottom in environmental policy involves both scaling back policies already in place and passing new policies that encourage less environmentally friendly behavior. Some states use this as an economic development strategy, especially in times of financial hardship. For example, in Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker decreased state environmental staff’s capacity in order to accelerate the approval time for a proposed development. Pursuing a race to the bottom philosophy in environmental politics allows states to foster economic growth, but has great consequences for the environment of that state. Conversely, some states have begun to pursue a race to the top strategy, which stresses innovative environmental policies at the state level, with the hopes that these policies will later be adopted by other states. When a state pursues either a race to the bottom or a race to the top strategy, it speaks to its overall environmental agenda.\n\n\n"}

This motive becomes especially prominent in situations of threat, failure or blows to one's self-esteem. Self-enhancement involves a preference for positive over negative self-views.\nIt is one of the four self-evaluation motives along with \"self-assessment\" (the drive for an accurate self-concept), \"self-verification\" (the drive for a self-concept congruent with one's identity) and \"self-improvement\" (the act of bettering one's self-concept).\nSelf-evaluation motives drive the process of self-regulation, that is, how people control and direct their own actions.\n\nThere are a variety of strategies that people can use to enhance their sense of personal worth. For example, they can downplay skills that they lack or they can criticise others to seem better by comparison. These strategies are successful, in that people tend to think of themselves as having more positive qualities and fewer negative qualities than others. Although self-enhancement is seen in people with low self-esteem as well as with high self-esteem, these two groups tend to use different strategies. People who already have high esteem enhance their self-concept directly, by processing new information in a biased way. People with low self-esteem use more indirect strategies, for example by avoiding situations in which their negative qualities will be noticeable.\n\nThere are controversies over whether or not self-enhancement is beneficial to the individual, and over whether self-enhancement is culturally universal or specific to Western individualism.\n\nSelf-enhancement can occur in many different situations and under many different guises. The general motive of self-enhancement can have many differing underlying explanations, each of which becomes more or less dominant depending on the situation.\n\nThe explanations of the self-enhancement motive can occur in different combinations. Self-enhancement can occur as an underlying motive or personality trait without occurring as an observed effect.\n\nBoth the extent and the type of self-enhancement vary across a number of dimensions.\n\nSelf-enhancement can occur by either self-advancing or self-protecting, that is either by enhancing the positivity of one's self-concept, or by reducing the negativity of one's self-concept. Self-protection appears to be the stronger of the two motives, given that avoiding negativity is of greater importance than encouraging positivity. However, as with all motivations, there are differences between individuals. For example, people with higher self-esteem appear to favour self-advancement, whereas people with lower self-esteem tend to self-protect. This highlights the role of risk: to not defend oneself against negativity in favour of self-promotion offers the potential for losses, whereas whilst one may not gain outright from self-protection, one does not incur the negativity either. People high in self-esteem tend to be greater risk takers and therefore opt for the more risky strategy of self-advancement, whereas those low in self-esteem and risk-taking hedge their bets with self-protection.\n\nSelf–enhancement can occur in private or in public. Public self-enhancement is obvious positive self-presentation, whereas private self enhancement is unnoticeable except to the individual. The presence of other people i.e. in public self-enhancement, can either augment or inhibit self-enhancement. Whilst self-enhancement may not always take place in public it is nevertheless still influenced by the social world, for example via social comparisons.\n\nPotential areas of self-enhancement differ in terms how important, or central, they are to a person. Self-enhancement tends to occur more in the domains that are the most important to a person, and less in more peripheral, less important domains.\n\nSelf-enhancement can occur either candidly or tactically. Candid self-enhancement serves the purpose of immediate gratification whereas tactical self-enhancement can result in potentially larger benefits from delayed gratification.\n\nTactical self-enhancement is often preferred over candid self-enhancement as overt self-enhancement is socially displeasing for those around it. Narcissism is an exemplification of extreme candid self-enhancement.\n\nSelf-enhancement does not just occur at random. Its incidence is often highly systematic and can occur in any number of ways in order to achieve its goal of inflating perceptions of the self. Importantly, we are typically unaware that we are self-enhancing. Awareness of self-enhancing processes would highlight the facade we are trying to create, revealing that the self we perceive is in fact an enhanced version of our actual self.\n\nSelf-enhancement can also affect the causal explanations people generate for social outcomes. People have a tendency to exhibit a self-serving attribution bias, that is to attribute positive outcomes to one's internal disposition but negative outcomes to factors beyond one's control e.g. others, chance or circumstance. In short, people claim credit for their successes but deny responsibilities for their failures. The self-serving attribution bias is very robust, occurring in public as well as in private, even when a premium is placed on honesty. People most commonly manifest a self-serving bias when they explain the origin or events in which they personally had a hand or a stake.\n\nExplanations for moral transgressions follow similar self-serving patterns, as do explanations for group behaviour. The ultimate attribution error is the tendency to regard negative acts by one's out-group and positive acts by one's in-group as essential to their nature i.e. attributable to their internal disposition and not a product of external factors. This may reflect the operation of the self-serving bias refracted through social identification.\n\nPeople sometimes self-enhance by selectively remembering their strengths rather than weaknesses. This pattern of selective forgetting has been described as mnemic neglect. Mnemic neglect may reflect biases in the processing of information at either encoding, retrieval or retention.\nThe role of mnemic neglect can be emphasised or reduced by the characteristics of a certain behaviour or trait. For example, after receiving false feedback pertaining to a variety of behaviours, participants recalled more positive behaviours than negative ones, but only when the behaviours exemplified central not peripheral traits and only when feedback pertained to the self and not to others. Similar findings emerge when the to-be-recalled information is personality traits, relationship promoting or undermining behaviours, frequencies of social acts, and autobiographical memories.\n\nSelective acceptance involves taking as fact self-flattering or ego-enhancing information with little regard for its validity. Selective refutation involves searching for plausible theories that enable criticism to be discredited. A good example of selective acceptance and refutation in action would be: Selective acceptance is the act of accepting as valid an examination on which one has performed well without consideration of alternatives, whereas selective refutation would be mindfully searching for reasons to reject as invalid an examination on which one has performed poorly.\n\nConcordant with selective acceptance and refutation is the observation that people hold a more critical attitude towards blame placed upon them, but a more lenient attitude to praise that they receive. People will strongly contest uncongenial information but readily accept at without question congenial information\n\nThe social nature of the world we live in means that self-evaluation cannot take place in an absolute nature – comparison to other social beings is inevitable. Many social comparisons occur automatically as a consequence of circumstance, for example within an exam sitting social comparisons of intellect may occur to those sitting the same exam. However, the strength of the self-enhancement motive can cause the subjective exploitation of scenarios in order to give a more favourable outcome to the self in comparisons between the self and others. Such involuntary social comparisons prompt self-regulatory strategies.\n\nSelf-esteem moderates the beneficial, evaluative consequences of comparisons to both inferior and superior others. People with higher self-esteem are more optimistic about both evading the failures and misfortunes of their inferiors and about securing the successes and good fortunes of their superiors.\n\nAn upwards social comparison involves comparing oneself to an individual perceived to be superior to or better than oneself. Upwards social comparison towards someone felt to be similar to oneself can induce self-enhancement through assimilation of the self and other's characteristics, however this only occurs when:\nWhere assimilation does not occur as a result of a social comparison, contrast can instead occur which can lead to upwards social comparisons providing inspiration.\n\nEven though upwards social comparisons are the most common social comparisons, people do sometimes make downwards social comparisons. Downwards social comparisons involve comparing oneself to an individual perceived to be inferior to or less skilled than the self. Downwards social comparisons serve as a form of ego-defence whereby the ego is inflated due to the sense of superiority gained from such downwards social comparisons.\n\nLateral social comparisons, comparisons against those perceived as equal to the self, can also be self-enhancing. Comparisons with members of one's in-group can lead be protective against low self-esteem, especially when the in-group are disadvantaged.\n\nSelf-enhancement waxes and wanes as a function of one's ability level in the context of interpersonal relationships, and this, in turn influences interpersonal attitudes and behaviours. Three factors influence the self-evaluations people make:\n\nPeople adopt a variety of coping strategies to deal with the pressures of self-evaluation:\n\nThe concepts that people use to understand themselves and their social world are relatively vague. Consequently, when making social comparisons or estimations people can easily and subtly shift their construal of the meaning of those concepts in order to self-enhance. Strategic construals typically increase following negative feedback. Numerous examples of strategic construals exist, a small selection include:\n\nStrategic construals appear to operate around one's self-esteem. After either positive or negative feedback people with high self-esteem alter their perceptions of others, typically varying their perceptions of others ability and performance in a self-enhancing direction. Those with low self-esteem however do not. Self-esteem level appears to moderate the use of strategic construals. As well as operating as a function of self-esteem level, strategic construals also appear to protect self-esteem levels. For example, members of minority groups who perform poorly in academic settings due to negative cultural attitudes towards them, subsequently disengage psychologically from, and dissidentify with academic pursuits in general. Whilst buffering their self-esteem level they jeopardise their future socioeconomic prospects.\n\nStrategic construals also influence the degree to which categories are believed to characterise other people. There is a general tendency to assume that others share one's own characteristics. Nevertheless, people reliably overestimate the prevalence of their shortcomings e.g. show enhanced false consensus effect, and underestimate the prevalence of their strengths e.g. show a contrary false uniqueness effect. People perceive their flaws as relatively commonplace but their skills as unique.\n\nBehavioural self-handicapping is the act of erecting obstacles in the path of task success in order to reduce the evaluative implications that can be drawn from task performance.\nThis permits self-enhancement to occur in two ways:\nPeople low in self-esteem opt for discounting as a self-protective route to avoid being perceived as incompetent, whereas people high in self-esteem preferentially select augmenting as a method of self-promotion to enhance their perceived competence. Self-handicapping, whilst predominantly a behaviour that occurs in private performance is magnified in public situations. However, self-handicapping is highly risky in social situations. If found out, those who use it face the negative evaluation and criticism of others.\n\nRegardless of the causes of self-handicapping the self-defeating end result remains the same – the integrity and quality of a task outcome or evaluation is compromised in order that the meaning of that outcome appears more agreeable. Behavioural self-handicapping is a good demonstration of active self-deception.\n\nWhilst task performance is important to people, they do sometimes act in ways so as to paradoxically impair task performance, either to protect against the shame of performing poorly by creating a convenient excuse (discounting), or to enhance themselves by succeeding despite adversity by creating grounds for conceit (augmenting). Furthermore, self-handicapping can have unintentional adverse consequences. Whilst allowing the maintenance of positive self-views self-handicapping has the cost of impairing objective performance. Students who report frequent use self-handicapping strategies underperform relative to their aptitude, with poor examination preparation mediating the effect.\n\nUltimately, those who readily prepare themselves for the possibility of poor task performance beforehand use the strategy of discounting less.\n\nThe effect of self-enhancement strategies is shown in the tendency of people to see themselves as having more positive qualities and a more positive future outlook than others.\n\nPeople generally hold unrealistically positive views about themselves. Such flattering views can often be neatly categorised within what has become known as the Triad of Positive Illusions. The three illusions in question are \"Above-average effect\", \"illusions of control\", and Unrealistic optimism. These illusions can be replicated across many situations and are highly resistant to revision. Rather ironically, when informed of the existence of such illusions, people generally consider themselves to be less prone to them than others.\n\nThe better-than-average-effect is the most common demonstration of an above-average effect. It is a highly robust effect, as evidenced by the fact that even when the criteria on which the self and others are judged are identical the self is still perceived more favourably. Things close to the self also take on the perceived superiority of the above-average effect. People value both their close relationships and their personal possessions above those of others. However, where an outcome is perceived as highly skilled, people often err on the side of caution and display a worse-than-average effect. The majority of people would rate themselves as below average in unicycling ability, for example.\nThe illusory nature of the above-average effect comes from the fact that not everyone can be above-average – otherwise the average would not be the average! The majority of people rating themselves as being better than the majority of people does not quite seem plausible, and in some situations is 100% impossible. Where a distribution is symmetrical i.e. mean = median = mode, it is statistically impossible for the majority of people to be above average, as whichever of the three averages is taken, all are equal to the 50th percentile. In a non-symmetrical distribution i.e. mean < median < mode or mode < median < mean, it is statistically impossible for the majority of people to be above average when the average is taken to be the median, as the median represents the 50th percentile, or the midpoint of the data. However, in a non-symmetrical distribution where the average is taken to be either the mean or the mode, the above-average effect can be statistically plausible. In some situations the majority of people can be above-average!\n\nPeople show self-enhancement in the form of the above-average effect in many different ways. It is typical for people to profess to be above-average at a task yielding positive or desirable outcomes, and below average at a task yielding negative or undesirable outcomes.\n\nSome of the wide variety of documented examples of the above-average effect include observations that:\n\n\nPeople overestimate the level of control they have over outcomes and contingencies, seeing their actions as influential even when they are in fact inconsequential. Also, people stand by their apparent conviction that they can influence the outcomes of inherently random systems for example lotteries, especially when such systems possess features typically associated with skill-based tasks. Even when a degree of contingency does exist between actions and outcomes, people still reliably overestimate the strength of that contingency.\n\nPeople typically believe that their life will hold a greater number of positive experiences and fewer negative experiences than the lives of similar others. They have the same unrealistic optimism, but to a lesser degree, for others who are closely linked, such as romantic partners and close personal friends.\n\nUnrealistic optimism is apparent in people's behaviours and beliefs across many different situations. People can both overestimate their ability to predict the future, and underestimate how long it will take them to complete a variety of tasks. People also overestimate the accuracy of their social predictions, and interpret probability adverbs to award higher values for personal positive outcomes and lower values for personal negative outcomes. Smokers, rather alarmingly, underestimate their risk of cancer relative to both non-smokers and even in comparison with fellow smokers.\n\nThere is controversy over whether self-enhancement is adaptive or maladaptive. A single operationalisation of self-enhancement can be influenced by a variety of motives and thus can be coordinated with both positive and negative outcomes. Those who misperceive their performance (self-enhancers and self-effacers) tend to have a lower academic achievement, lower subsequent performance . These results appear to be culturally universal. Surely, it's a false assumption to relate self enhancement to depression.\n\nWhich definition is better at measuring self-enhancement has been disputed, as rating oneself more positively than one rates others is not seen as self-enhancement by some researchers.\n\nIn some studies, self-enhancement has been shown to have strong positive links with good mental health and in others with bad mental health. Self-enhancing can also have social costs. Whilst promoting resilience amongst survivors of the September 11th terrorist attacks, those who self-enhanced were rated as having decreased social adaptation and honesty by friends and family.\n\nSelf-enhancement thrives upon the vagueness or ambiguity of evidence. Where criteria are rigidly defined, self-enhancement typically reduces. For example, the above-average effect decreases as clarity and definition of the defined trait increases. The easier it is to verify a behaviour or trait, the less that trait will be subject to self-enhancement. The plausibility of a trait or characteristic given real world evidence moderates the degree to which the self-enhancement of that trait occurs. Selectively recalling instances of desirable traits is moderated by one's actual standing on those traits in reality.\n\nWhen plausibility reduces the impact of self-enhancement, undesirable evidence often has to be accepted, albeit reluctantly. This typically occurs when all possible interpretations of the evidence in question have been made. The reason for this unwilling acceptance is to maintain effective social functioning, where unqualified self-aggrandizement would otherwise prevent it. People will continue to self-enhance so long as they think they can get away with it.\n\nThe constraint of plausibility on self enhancement exists because self-enhancing biases cannot be exploited. Self-enhancement works only under the assumption of rationality – to admit to self-enhancing totally undermines any conclusions one can draw and any possibility of believing its facade, since according to legit rational processes it functions as a genuinely verifiable and accredited improvement.\n\nBoth positive and negative moods can reduce the presence of the self-enhancement motive. The effects of mood on self-enhancement can be explained by a negative mood making the use self-enhancing tactics harder, and a positive mood making their use less necessary in the first place.\n\nThe onset of a positive mood can make people more receptive to negative diagnostic feedback. Past successes are reviewed with expectation of receiving such positive feedback, presumably to buffer their mood.\n\nDepression has quite a well-evidenced link with a decrease in the motive to self-enhance. Depressives are less able to self-enhance in response to negative feedback than non-depressive controls. Having a depressive disposition decreases the discrepancy between one's own estimates of one's virtues and the estimates of a neutral observer, namely by increasing modesty. Illusions of control are moderated by melancholy. However, whilst the self-ratings of depressives are more in line with those of neutral observers than the self ratings of normals, the self ratings of normals are more in line with those of friends and family than the self ratings of depressives.\n\nThe presence of the motive to self-enhance is dependent on many social situations, and the relationships shared with the people in them. Many different materialisations of self-enhancement can occur depending on such social contexts:\n\nPsychological functioning is moderated by the influence of culture. There is much evidence to support a culture-specific view of self-enhancement.\nSelf-enhancement appears to be a phenomenon largely limited to Western cultures, where social ties are looser than in the East. This is concordant with empirical evidence highlighting relationship closeness as a constraint on self-enhancement. The self-improvement motive, as an aspiration towards a possible self may also moderate a variety of psychological processes in both independent and interdependent cultures.\n\nThere are nevertheless signs that self-enhancement is not completely absent in interdependent cultures. Chinese schoolchildren rate themselves highly on the dimension of competence, and Taiwanese employees rate themselves more favourably than their employers do, both of which show self-enhancing tendencies in Eastern cultures.\n\nOne possible explanation for the observed differences in self-enhancement between cultures is that they may occur through differences in how candidly of tactically the motive to self-enhance is acted upon, and not due to variations in the strength of motive. Alternatively, self-enhancement may be represented only in terms of the characteristics that are deemed important by individuals as they strive to fulfil their culturally prescribed roles.\n\nThe issue over whether self-enhancement is universal or specific to Western cultures has been contested within modern literature by two researchers — Constantine Sedikides and Steven Heine. Sedikides argues that self-enhancement is universal, and that different cultures self-enhance in domains important in their culture. Heine on the other hand describes self-enhancement as a predominantly Western motive.\n\nIt is an exaggeration to say that self-enhancement is the dominant self-evaluation motive. Many controversies exist regarding the distinction between the self-evaluation motives, and there are situations in which motives asides from self-enhancement assume priority.\nWhere the truth about oneself worsens or varies it gradually becomes less feasible to satisfy all motives simultaneously.\n\nIn an attempt to compare the self-evaluation motives (excluding self-improvement) a self-reflection task was employed. Participants were asked to choose the question they would most likely ask themselves in order to determine whether they possessed a certain personality trait. On the whole, people self-enhanced more than they self-assessed or self-verified. People chose higher diagnosticity questions concerning central, positive traits than central, negative ones, and answered yes more often to central, positive than negative questions. Also, people self-verified more than the self-assessed, and chose more questions overall concerning relatively certain central traits than relatively uncertain peripheral traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "294374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294374", "title": "Sigil (magic)", "text": "Sigil (magic)\n\nA sigil (; pl. \"sigilla\" or \"sigils\") is a symbol used in magic. The term has usually referred to a type of pictorial signature of a demon or other entity; in modern usage, especially in the context of chaos magic, it refers to a symbolic representation of the magician's desired outcome.\n\nThe term \"sigil\" derives from the Latin \"sigillum\", meaning \"seal\".\n\nIn medieval ceremonial magic, the term \"sigil\" was commonly used to refer to occult signs which represented various angels and demons which the magician might summon. The magical training books called grimoires often listed pages of such sigils. A particularly well-known list is in \"The Lesser Key of Solomon\", in which the sigils of the 72 princes of the hierarchy of hell are given for the magician's use. Such sigils were considered to be the equivalent of the true name of the spirit and thus granted the magician a measure of control over the beings.\n\nA common method of creating the sigils of certain spirits was to use \"kameas\" (magic squares) — the names of the spirits were converted to numbers, which were then located on the magic square. The locations were then connected by lines, forming an abstract figure.\n\nThe use of symbols for magical or cultic purposes has been widespread since at least the Neolithic era. Some examples from other cultures include the \"yantra\" from Hindu tantra, historical runic magic among the Germanic peoples, or the use of \"veves\" in Voudon.\n\nThe artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare developed his own unique method of creating and using sigils, which has had a huge effect on modern occultism. Essentially, Spare turned the Medieval practice of using sigils to evoke entities on its head, arguing that such supernatural beings were simply complexes in the unconscious, and could be actively \"created\" through the process of sigilisation. \n\nSpare's technique became a cornerstone of chaos magic. It also influenced the artist Brion Gysin, who experimented with combinining Spare's sigil method with the traditional form of magic squares:\n\nCalligraphic magick squares were one of the techniques most commonly applied by Gysin. He would reduce a name or an idea to a \"glyph\" and then write across the paper from right to left, turn the paper and do the same again, and so on, turning the paper around and around to create a multi-dimensional grid... The same techniques and consciously driven functional intention also permeated his paintings. In a very real sense, everything he created was an act of sorcery.\n\nIn chaos magic, following Spare, sigils are most commonly created by writing out the intention, then condensing the letters of the statement down to form a sort of monogram. The chaos magician then uses the gnostic state to \"launch\" or \"charge\" the sigil – essentially bypassing the conscious mind to implant the desire in the unconscious. To quote Ray Sherwin:\n\nThe magician acknowledges a desire, he lists the appropriate symbols and arranges them into an easily visualised glyph. Using any of the gnostic techniques he reifies the sigil and then, by force of will, hurls it into his subconscious from where the sigil can begin to work unencumbered by desire.\n\nAfter charging the sigil, it is considered necessary to repress all memory of it: in the words of Spare, there should be \"a deliberate striving to forget it\".\n\nIn modern chaos magic, when a complex of thoughts, desires and intentions gains such a level of sophistication that it appears to operate autonomously from the magician's consciousness, as if it were an independent being, then such a complex is referred to as a servitor. When such a being becomes large enough that it exists independently of any one individual, as a form of \"group mind\", then it is referred to as an egregore.\n\nLater chaos magicians have expanded on the basic sigilisation technique. Grant Morrison coined the term \"hypersigil\" to refer to an extended work of art with magical meaning and willpower, created using adapted processes of sigilization. His comic book series \"The Invisibles\" was intended as such a hypersigil. Morrison has also argued that modern corporate logos like \"the McDonald's Golden Arches, the Nike swoosh and the Virgin autograph\" are a form of viral sigil:\n\nCorporate sigils are super-breeders. They attack unbranded imaginative space. They invade Red Square, they infest the cranky streets of Tibet, they etch themselves into hairstyles. They breed across clothing, turning people into advertising hoardings... The logo or brand, like any sigil, is a condensation, a compressed, symbolic summoning up of the world of desire which the corporation intends to represent... Walt Disney died long ago but his sigil, that familiar, cartoonish signature, persists, carrying its own vast weight of meanings, associations, nostalgia and significance.\n\nGordon White developed the technique of \"shoaling\", which involves launching a group of sigils for a set of related aims. For example, instead of sigilising for \"money\", sigilising for a pay rise, new business clients, a promotion, influential new contacts, budget reallocation for your department, etc. – all of which help \"shift the probability\" towards the overall aim. White also developed the technique of the \"robofish\", which consists of including a sigil for something that the chaos magician knows will definitely happen, to \"lead\" the rest of the shoal.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "440579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=440579", "title": "Silence", "text": "Silence\n\nSilence is the absence of ambient audible sound, the emission of sounds of such low intensity that they do not draw attention to themselves, or the state of having ceased to produce sounds; this latter sense can be extended to apply to the cessation or absence of any form of communication, whether through speech or other medium. \n\nSometimes speakers fall silent when they hesitate in searching for a word, or interrupt themselves before correcting themselves. Discourse analysis shows that people use brief silences to mark the boundaries of prosodic units, in turn-taking, or as\nreactive tokens, e.g., as a sign of displeasure, disagreement, embarrassment, desire to think, confusion, and the like. Relatively prolonged intervals of silence can be used in rituals; in some religious disciplines, people maintain silence for protracted periods, or even for the rest of their lives, as an ascetic means of spiritual transformation. \n\nJoseph Jordania has suggested that in social animals (including humans), silence can be a sign of danger. Many social animals produce seemingly haphazard sounds which are known as contact calls. These are a mixture of various sounds, accompanying the group's everyday business (for example, foraging, feeding), and they are used to maintain audio contact with the members of the group. Some social animal species communicate the signal of potential danger by stopping contact calls and freezing, without the use of alarm calls, through silence. Charles Darwin wrote about this in relation with wild horse and cattle. Jordania has further suggested that human humming could have been a contact method that early humans used to avoid silence. According to his suggestion, humans find prolonged silence distressing (suggesting danger to them). This may help explain why lone humans in relative sonic isolation feel a sense of comfort from humming, whistling, talking to themselves, or having the TV or radio on.\n\n\"Silence\" in spirituality is often a metaphor for inner stillness. A silent mind, freed from the onslaught of thoughts and thought patterns, is both a goal and an important step in spiritual development. Such \"inner silence\" is not about the absence of sound; instead, it is understood to bring one in contact with the divine, the ultimate reality, or one's own true self, one's divine nature. Many religious traditions imply the importance of being quiet and still in mind and spirit for transformative and integral spiritual growth to occur. In Christianity, there is the silence of contemplative prayer such as centering prayer and Christian meditation; in Islam, there are the wisdom writings of the Sufis who insist on the importance of finding silence within. In Buddhism, the descriptions of silence and allowing the mind to become silent are implied as a feature of spiritual enlightenment. In Hinduism, including the teachings of Advaita Vedanta and the many paths of yoga, teachers insist on the importance of silence, \"Mauna\", for inner growth. Perkey Avot, the Jewish Sages guide for living, states that, \"Tradition is a safety fence to Torah, tithing a safety fence to wealth, vows a safety fence for abstinence; a safety fence for wisdom ... is silence.\" In some traditions of Quakerism, communal silence is the usual context of worship meetings, in patient expectancy for the divine to speak in the heart and mind. Eckhart Tolle says that silence can be seen either as the absence of noise, or as the space in which sound exists, just as inner stillness can be seen as the absence of thought, or the space in which thoughts are perceived.\n\nA common way to remember a tragic incident and to remember the victims or casualties of such an event is a commemorative moment of silence.\n\nArgumentative silence is the rhetorical practice of saying nothing when an opponent in a debate expects something to be said. Poorly executed, it can be offensive, like refusing to answer a direct question. However, well-timed silence can throw an opponent off and give the debater the upper hand.\n\nAn argument from silence () is an argument based on the assumption that someone's silence on a matter suggests (an informal fallacy) that person's ignorance of the matter. In general, \"ex silentio\" refers to the claim that the absence of something demonstrates the proof of a proposition.\n\nThe right to silence is a legal protection enjoyed by people undergoing police interrogation or trial in certain countries. The law is either explicit or recognized in many legal systems.\n\nThe documentary film \"In Pursuit of Silence\" (2016) portrays the spiritual and physical benefits of silence, as well as the price paid individually and collectively for a noisy world. It is narrated by authors Helen Lees (\"Silence in Schools\"), Pico Iyer (\"The Art of Stillness\"), Susan Cain (\"\"), Maggie Ross (\"Silence: A User’s Guide\"), and George Prochnik (\"In Pursuit of Silence\").\n\nMusic inherently depends on silence, in some form or another, to distinguish other periods of sound and allow dynamics, melodies, and rhythms to have greater impact. For example, most music scores feature \"rests\", which denote periods of silence. In addition, silence in music can be seen as a time for contemplation. The audience feels the effects of the previous notes and melodies, and can intentionally reflect on what they have heard. Silence does not hinder musical excellence but can enhance the sounds of instruments and vocals within a given musical composition.\n\nIn his book \"Sound and Silence\" (1970), the composer John Paynter says, \"the dramatic effect of silence has long been appreciated by composers.\" He gives as an example \"the general pause in the middle of the chorus ‘Have lightnings and thunders …’ in Bach’s \"St. Matthew Passion\"\":\n\nAfter the pause, the music continues to the words: \"Open up the fiery bottomless pit, O hell!\" The silence is intended to communicate a momentary sensation of terror, of staring into unfathomable darkness. Another example of a dramatic silence comes in the \"rest full of tension\" at the climactic ending of the \"Hallelujah\" chorus in Handel’s \"Messiah\":\n\nMusical silences may also convey humour. Haydn's Quartet in E flat, Op. 33 was nicknamed \"The Joke\", because of the comic timing of the pauses at the end of the last movement:\n\nTaruskin (2010, p. 552) says, \"whenever this ending is performed, it takes the audience an extra second or so to recover its wits and realize that the piece is indeed over. The result is an inevitable giggle—the same giggle that overtakes a prestidigitator’s audience when it realizes that it has been ‘had’.\"\n\nBarry Cooper (2011, p.38) writes extensively of Beethoven's many uses of silence for contemplation, for dramatic effect and especially for driving the rhythmic impetus of the music. He cites the start of the second movement of the Ninth Symphony, where the silences contribute to a powerful sense of propulsion: \"The rhythm of bar 1 is incomplete and demands a note at the beginning of bar 2. The substitution of such a note by a whole-bar rest therefore gives the effect of a suppressed sound, as if one were about to speak but then refrains at the last moment. The 'suppressed sound' is then repeated in bar 4, and 'developed' (by being doubled) in bars 7 and 8.\" writes of the \"strange irregularity of rhythm in the sixth bar\" of this movement.\n\nMuch has been said about the harmony of the opening to Wagner's opera \"Tristan und Isolde\", which Taruskin (2010, p.540) calls \"perhaps the most famous, surely the most commented-on, single phrase of music ever written.\" However, Wagner’s strategic use of silences between phrases intensifies the troubled ambiguity of the music: \"The chord that fills the ensuing silence in the listener’s inner ear… is the unstated – indeed never to be stated, and ultimately needless to be stated – tonic of that key.\"\nSome of the most effective musical silences are very short, lasting barely a fraction of a second. In the spirited and energetic finale of his Symphony No. 2, Brahms uses silences at several points to powerfully disrupt the rhythmic momentum that has been building. (See also syncopation.)\n\nDuring the 20th century, composers explored further the expressive potential of silence in their music. The contemplative concluding bars of Anton Webern’s \"Symphony\" (1928) and Stravinsky’s \"Les Noces\" The Wedding, 1923) make telling and atmospheric use of pauses. Eric Walter White (1947, p.74) describes the ending of \"Les Noces\" as follows: \"As the voices cease singing, pools of silence come flooding in between the measured strokes of the bell chord, and the music dies away in a miraculously fresh and radiant close.\"\n\nJohn Paynter (1970, p. 24) vividly conveys how silence contributes to the titanic impact of the third section of Messiaen’s orchestral work \"Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum\" (1964):Woodwinds jump, growl and shriek. Silence. Eight solemn bell strokes echo and die. Again silence. Suddenly the brasses blare, and out of the trombones’ awesome processional grows a steady roar … the big gongs the tam-tam beaten in a long and powerful resonance, shattering and echoing across mountains and along valleys. This is music of the high hills, music for vast spaces: ‘The hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God’. We can feel the awe and the majesty of the High Alps and the great churches. The instrumental sounds are vast the silences are deep. The words of St John are alive in the music, and through these sounds Messiaen reveals himself and his vision.An extreme example from 1952 is \"4′33″\", an experimental musical work by avant-garde composer John Cage, incorporating ambient sounds not foreseeable by the composer. Though first performed on the piano, the piece was composed for any instrument or instruments and is structured in three movements. The length of each movement is not fixed by the composer, but the total length of the combination of three movements is. The score instructs the performer(s) to remain silent throughout the piece.\n\nThere are telling examples of the use of silence in jazz. A frequently used effect, known as \"stop-time\", places silences at moments where listeners or dancers might expect a strong beat, contributing to the syncopation. Scott Joplin's \"Rag-Time Dance\" (1902) features stop-time silences:\nEarly recordings of the \"Rag Time Dance\" follow Joplin’s instructions as follows: \"To get the desired effect of 'Stop Time', the pianist will please stamp the heel of one foot heavily upon the floor.\" However, later recordings disregard this direction – the regular beat is implied rather than stated and the silences are more palpable. Keith Swanwick (1979, p.70) is enchanted by the \"playfulness and humour\" engendered by the stop-time effects in Jelly Roll Morton's solo piano recording of \"The Crave\" (1939): \"If we listen to this, tapping or clicking along with the beat, we shalt find ourselves surprised by two patches of silence near the end. The beat goes on but the sound stops. The effect is something like being thrown forward when a car stops suddenly. It is the biggest surprise in an engaging piece of music full of little deviations (syncopations) from the repeated beat.\"\n\nOther examples include the closing bars of Louis Armstrong's recording of \"Struttin' with Some Barbecue\" (1928) and the hair's-breadth pause at the end of pianist Bill Evans' solo on Miles Davis' recording of \"On Green Dolphin Street\" (1959). Duke Ellington's \"Madness in Great Ones\", from his Shakespearean Suite \"Such Sweet Thunder\" (1957) conveys the feigned madness of Prince Hamlet through abrupt and unpredictable pauses that interrupt the flow of the music. The reggae band Black Slate had a hit in 1980 with the song \"Amigo\". The instrumental introduction features sudden silences before the voice enters.\n\n\n"}

Mappō or Mofa (, Japanese: \"Mappō\"), which is also translated as the \"Age of Dharma Decline\", is the \"degenerate\" Third Age of Buddhism, also known as The Latter Day of the Law.\n\nThe Three Ages of Buddhism are three divisions of time following Buddha's passing: \n\nThe three periods are significant to Mahayana adherents, particularly those who hold the \"Lotus Sutra\" in high regard, namely the Tiantai and Tendai and Nichiren Buddhism, who believe that different Buddhist teachings are valid (i.e., able to lead practitioners to enlightenment) in each period due to the different capacity to accept a teaching (機根 Cn: jīgēn; Jp: kikon) of the people born in each respective period.\n\nFurther, in the \"Mahāsaṃnipāta Sutra\", the three periods are further divided into five five-hundred year periods (五五百歳 Cn: wǔ wǔ bǎi sùi; Jp: go no gohyaku sai), the fifth and last of which was prophesied to be when the Buddhism of Sakyamuni would lose all power of salvation and a new Buddha would appear to save the people. This time period would be characterized by unrest, strife, famine, and natural disasters.\n\nTraditionally, this age is supposed to begin 2000 years after Gautama Buddha's passing and last for \"10,000 years\". The first two ages are the \"Age of Right Dharma\" (正法 Cn: zhèngfǎ; Jp: shōbō), followed by the \"Age of Semblance Dharma\" (, Japanese: \"zōbō\"). During this degenerate third age, it is believed that people will be unable to attain enlightenment through the word of Sakyamuni Buddha, and society will become morally corrupt. In Buddhist thought, during the Age of Dharma Decline the teachings of the Buddha will still be correct, but people will no longer be capable of following them.\n\nBuddhist temporal cosmology assumes a cyclical pattern of ages, and even when the current Buddha's teachings fall into disregard, a new Buddha will at some point (usually considered to be millions of years in the future) be born to ensure the continuity of Buddhism. In the \"Lotus Sutra\", Visistacaritra is entrusted to spread Buddhist law in this age and save mankind and the earth. He and countless other Bodhisattvas, specifically called Bodhisattvas of the Earth (of which he is the leader), vow to be reborn in a latter day to re-create Buddhist law, thus turning the degenerate age into a flourishing paradise. Shakyamuni entrusts them instead of his more commonly known major disciples with this task since the Bodhisattvas of the Earth have had a karmic connection with Shakyamuni since the beginning of time, meaning that they are aware of the Superior Practice which is the essence of Buddhism or the Dharma in its original, pure form. Ksitigarbha is also known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the six worlds, in the era between the death of Gautama and the rise of Maitreya. Teacher Savaripa would also live in the world to teach someone.\n\nThe teaching appeared early. References to the decline of the Dharma over time can be found in such Mahayana sutras as the \"Diamond Sutra\" and the \"Lotus Sutra\", but also to a lesser degree in some texts in the Pāli Canon such as the \"Cullavagga\" of the Vinaya Pitaka. Nanyue Huisi was an early monk who taught about it; he is considered the third Patriarch of the Tiantai.\n\nThe Sanjiejiao was an early sect that taught about Mò Fǎ. It taught to respect every sutra and all sentient life.\n\nLate Buddhism in Central Asia taught the building of auspicious signs or miraculous Buddhist images.\n\nPure Land Buddhism in China and Japan believe we are now in this latter age of \"degenerate Dharma\". Pure Land followers therefore attempt to attain rebirth into the pure land of Amitābha, where they can practice the Dharma more readily.\n\nNichiren Buddhism has taught that its teaching is the most suitable for the recent Mò Fǎ period.\n\nVajrayana Buddhism taught that its teaching would be popular when \"iron birds are upon the sky\" before its decline. The \"Kalacakra tantra\" contains a prophecy of a holy war in which a Buddhist king will win.\n\nTheravada Buddhists taught that Buddhism would decline in five thousand years.\n\nSome monks such as Dōgen and Hsu Yun had alternative views regarding dharma decline. Dōgen believed that there is no Mò Fǎ while Hsu Yun thought Mò Fǎ is not inevitable.\n\nSome Chinese folk religions taught that the three ages were the teaching period of Dīpankara Buddha, Gautama Buddha, and the current era of Maitreya.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3980175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3980175", "title": "Type physicalism", "text": "Type physicalism\n\nType physicalism (also known as reductive materialism, type identity theory, mind–brain identity theory and identity theory of mind) is a physicalist theory, in the philosophy of mind. It asserts that mental events can be grouped into types, and can then be correlated with types of physical events in the brain. For example, one type of mental event, such as \"mental pains\" will, presumably, turn out to be describing one type of physical event (like C-fiber firings).\n\nType physicalism is contrasted by token identity physicalism, which argues that mental events are unlikely to have \"steady\" or categorical biological correlates. These positions make use of the philosophical type–token distinction (e.g., Two persons having the same \"type\" of car need not mean that they share a \"token\", a single vehicle). Type physicalism can now be understood to argue that there is identicalness between types, whereas token identity physicalism says one can only describe a particular, unique, brain event.\n\nThere are other ways a physicalist might criticize type physicalism; eliminative materialism and revisionary materialism question whether science is currently using the best categorisations. In the same way talk of demonic possession was questioned with scientific advance, categorisations like \"pain\" may need to be revised.\n\nAccording to U. T. Place, one of the popularizers of the idea of type-identity in the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of type-identity physicalism originated in the 1930s with the psychologist E. G. Boring and took nearly a quarter of a century to gain acceptance from the philosophical community. Boring, in a book entitled \"The Physical Dimensions of Consciousness\" (1933) wrote that:\n\nTo the author a perfect correlation is identity. Two events that always occur together at the same time in the same place, without any temporal or spatial differentiation at all, are not two events but the same event. The mind-body correlations as formulated at present, do not admit of spatial correlation, so they reduce to matters of simple correlation in time. The need for identification is no less urgent in this case (p. 16, quoted in Place [unpublished]).\n\nThe barrier to the acceptance of any such vision of the mind, according to Place, was that philosophers and logicians had not yet taken a substantial interest in questions of identity and referential identification in general. The dominant epistemology of the logical positivists at that time was phenomenalism, in the guise of the theory of sense-data. Indeed, Boring himself subscribed to the phenomenalist creed, attempting to reconcile it with an identity theory and this resulted in a \"reductio ad absurdum\" of the identity theory, since brain states would have turned out, on this analysis, to be identical to colors, shapes, tones and other sensory experiences.\n\nThe revival of interest in the work of Gottlob Frege and his ideas of sense and reference on the part of Herbert Feigl and J.J.C. Smart, along with the discrediting of phenomenalism through the influence of the later Wittgenstein and J.L. Austin, led to a more tolerant climate toward physicalistic and realist ideas. Logical behaviorism emerged as a serious contender to take the place of the Cartesian \"ghost in the machine\" and, although not lasting very long as a dominant position on the mind/body problem, its elimination of the whole realm of internal mental events was strongly influential in the formation and acceptance of the thesis of type identity.\n\nThere were actually subtle but interesting differences between the three most widely credited formulations of the type-identity thesis, those of Place, Feigl and Smart which were published in several articles in the late 1950s. However, all of the versions share the central idea that the mind is identical to something physical.\n\nU. T. Place's (1956) notion of the relation of identity was derived from Bertrand Russell's distinction among several types of \"is\" statements: the \"is\" of identity, the \"is\" of equality and the \"is\" of composition. Place's version of the relation of identity is more accurately described as a relation of composition. For Place, higher-level mental events are composed out of lower-level physical events and will eventually be analytically reduced to these. So, to the objection that \"sensations\" do not mean the same thing as \"mental processes\", Place could simply reply with the example that \"lightning\" does not mean the same thing as \"electrical discharge\" since we determine that something is lightning by looking and seeing it, whereas we determine that something is an electrical discharge through experimentation and testing. Nevertheless, \"lightning is an electrical discharge\" is true since the one is composed of the other.\n\nFor Feigl (1957) and Smart (1959), on the other hand, the identity was to be interpreted as the identity between the referents of two descriptions (senses) which referred to the same thing, as in \"the morning star\" and \"the evening star\" both referring to Venus, a necessary identity. So to the objection about the lack of equality of meaning between \"sensation\" and \"brain process\", their response was to invoke this Fregean distinction: \"sensations\" and \"brain\" processes do indeed \"mean\" different things but they refer to the same physical phenomenon. Moreover, \"sensations are brain processes\" is a contingent, not a necessary, identity.\n\nOne of the most influential and common objections to the type identity theory is the argument from multiple realizability. The multiple realizability thesis asserts that mental states can be realized in multiple kinds of systems, not just brains, for example. Since the identity theory identifies mental events with certain brain states, it does not allow for mental states to be realized in organisms or computational systems that do not have a brain. This is in effect an argument that the identity theory is too narrow because it does not allow for organisms without brains to have mental states. However, \"token identity\" (where only particular tokens of mental states are identical with particular tokens of physical events) and functionalism both account for multiple realizability.\n\nThe response of type identity theorists, such as Smart, to this objection is that, while it may be true that mental events are multiply realizable, this does not demonstrate the falsity of type identity. As Smart states:\n\nThe fundamental point is that it is extremely difficult to determine where, on the continuum of first order processes, type identity ends and merely token identities begin. Take Quine's example of English country gardens. In such gardens, the tops of hedges are cut into various shapes, for example the shape of an elf. We can make generalizations over the type \"elf-shaped hedge\" only if we abstract away from the concrete details of the individual twigs and branches of each hedge. So, whether we say that two things are of the same type or are tokens of the same type because of subtle differences is just a matter of descriptive abstraction. The type-token distinction is not all or nothing.\n\nHilary Putnam essentially rejects functionalism because, he believes, it is indeed a second-order type identity theory. Putnam uses multiple realizability against functionalism itself, suggesting that mental events (or kinds, in Putnam's terminology) may be diversely implemented by diverse functional/computational kinds; there may be only a token identification between particular mental kinds and particular functional kinds. Putnam, and many others who have followed him, now tend to identify themselves as generically non-reductive physicalists. Putnam's invocation of multiple realizability does not, of course, directly answer the problem raised by Smart with respect to useful generalizations over types and the flexible nature of the type-token distinction in relation to causal taxonomies in science.\n\nAnother frequent objection is that type identity theories fail to account for phenomenal mental states (or qualia), such as having a pain, feeling sad, experiencing nausea. (Qualia are merely the subjective qualities of conscious experience. An example is the way the pain of jarring ones elbow \"feels\" to the individual.) Arguments can be found in Saul Kripke (1972) and David Chalmers (1996), for example, according to which the identity theorist cannot identify phenomenal mental states with brain states (or any other physical state for that matter) because one has a sort of direct awareness of the nature of such qualitative mental states, and their nature is qualitative in a way that brain states are not.\n\nA famous formulation of the qualia objection comes from Frank Jackson (1982) in the form of the Mary's room thought experiment. Let us suppose, Jackson suggests, that a particularly brilliant super-scientist named Mary has been locked away in a completely black-and-white room her entire life. Over the years in her colour-deprived world she has studied (via black-and-white books and television) the sciences of neurophysiology, vision and electromagnetics to their fullest extent; eventually Mary comes to know all the physical facts there are to know about experiencing colour. When Mary is released from her room and experiences colour for the first time, does she learn something new? If we answer \"yes\" (as Jackson suggests we do) to this question, then we have supposedly denied the truth of type physicalism, for if Mary has exhausted all the physical facts about experiencing colour prior to her release, then her subsequently acquiring some new piece of information about colour upon experiencing its quale reveals that there must be something about the experience of colour which is not captured by the physicalist picture. (See Mary's room page for full discussion).\n\nThe type identity theorist, such as Smart, attempts to explain away such phenomena by insisting that the experiential properties of mental events are \"topic-neutral\". The concept of topic-neutral terms and expressions goes back to Gilbert Ryle, who identified such topic-neutral terms as \"if\", \"or\", \"not\", \"because\" and \"and.\" If one were to hear these terms alone in the course of a conversation, it would be impossible to tell whether the topic under discussion concerned geology, physics, history, gardening, or selling pizza. For the identity theorist, sense-data and qualia are not real things in the brain (or the physical world in general) but are more like \"the average electrician.\" The average electrician can be further analyzed and explained in terms of real electricians but is not itself a real electrician.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5646927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5646927", "title": "Universal mind", "text": "Universal mind\n\nUniversal mind or universal consciousness is a concept that tries to address the underlying essence of all being and becoming in the universe. It includes the being and becoming that occurred in the universe prior to the arising of the concept of \"Mind\", a term that more appropriately refers to the organic, human, aspect of universal consciousness. It addresses inorganic being and becoming and the interactions that occur in that process without specific reference to the physical and chemical laws that try to describe those interactions. Those interactions have occurred, do occur, and continue to occur. Universal consciousness is the source, ground, basis, that underlies those interactions and the awareness and knowledge they imply.\n\nThe concept of universal mind was presented by Anaxagoras, a Pre-Socratic philosopher who arrived in Athens some time after 480 BC. He taught that the growth of living things depends on the power of mind within the organisms that enables them to extract nourishment from surrounding substances. For this concept of mind, Anaxagoras was commended by Aristotle. Both Plato and Aristotle, however, objected that his notion of mind did not include a view that mind acts ethically, i.e. acts for the “best interests” of the universe.[1]\n\nThe most original aspect of Anaxagoras's system was his doctrine of \"nous\" (\"mind\" or \"reason\"). [2] A different Greek word, \"gnó̱si̱\" (awareness), better reflects what is observed in the wider world of organic and inorganic being than just the human world. A worm, an amoeba, a bacteria, a raindrop, appears to act with \"awareness\" (\"gnó̱si̱\") rather than \"reason\" (\"nous\"). Also, these actions would not commonly be referred to as being \"reasonable\" or \"ethical\".\n\nIn \"The Huang Po Doctrine of Universal Mind\", originated in around 857 CE, the idea of mind was disconnected from soul in this Buddhist school of thought.\n\nChu Ch’an says, “Universal mind, therefore, is something to which nothing can be attributed. Being absolute, it is beyond attributes. If for example, it were to be described as infinite, that would exclude from it whatever is finite, but the whole argument of the book is that universal mind is the only reality and that everything we apprehend through our senses, is nothing else but this mind. Even to think of it in terms of existence or non-existence is to misapprehend it entirely.” pp. 8–9 [3]\n\nThe term surfaced again in later philosophy, as in the writings of Hegel. - Hegel writes:\nErnest Holmes, the founder of the Science of Mind movement, described the universal mind as follows: \nNew Thought author Charles Haanel said of the universal mind and its relationship to humans:\nThe nature of the universal mind is said to be omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent.\n\nUniversal mind may be viewed from a scientific perspective as non-local consciousness. Michael Persinger wrote on non-local consciousness:\nThe atemporal nature of consciousness is explored by Mansoor Malik and Maria Hipolito. They summarise key theorists on the subject from different ontological perspectives:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9642550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9642550", "title": "Utility monster", "text": "Utility monster\n\nThe utility monster is a thought experiment in the study of ethics created by philosopher Robert Nozick in 1974 as a criticism of utilitarianism.\n\nA hypothetical being, which Nozick calls the \"utility monster,\" receives much more utility from each unit of a resource they consume than anyone else does. For instance, eating a cookie might bring only one unit of pleasure to an ordinary person but could bring 100 units of pleasure to a utility monster. If the utility monster can get so much pleasure from each unit of resources, it follows from utilitarianism that the distribution of resources should acknowledge this. If the utility monster existed, it would justify the mistreatment and perhaps annihilation of everyone else, according to the mandates of utilitarianism, because, for the utility monster, the pleasure they receive outweighs the suffering they may cause. Nozick writes:Utilitarian theory is embarrassed by the possibility of utility monsters who get enormously greater sums of utility from any sacrifice of others than these others lose ... the theory seems to require that we all be sacrificed in the monster's maw, in order to increase total utility. This thought experiment attempts to show that utilitarianism is not actually egalitarian, even though it appears to be at first glance.\n\nThe experiment contends that there is no way of aggregating utility which can circumvent the conclusion that all units should be given to a utility monster, because every different system has a monster and defeating one utility monster creates another. For example, in Rawls' maximin or difference principle, maximin sets a group's aggregate utility as that of the being with least utility. Thus, giving units to the utility monster fails to change the group's utility unless the utility monster has the least utility. Even if the utility monster has the least utility, maximin would only prefer allocating units to the monster until it catches up with the member that has next-to-least utility. This would defeat the \"happy\" utility monster of average utility. But if the person who has the least utility gains only a tiny amount of utility from each unit of resources, they may never catch up with the next person, so they can similarly consume all of the resources in the world. It can be shown that all consequentialist systems based on maximizing a global function are subject to utility monsters.\n\nRobert Nozick, a twentieth century American philosopher, coined the term \"utility monster\" in response to Jeremy Bentham's philosophy of utilitarianism. Nozick proposed that accepting the theory of utilitarianism causes the necessary acceptance of the condition that some people would use this to justify exploitation of others. An individual (or specific group) would claim their entitlement to more \"happy units\" than they claim others deserve, and the others would consequently be left to receive fewer \"happy units\".\n\nNozick deems these exploiters \"utility monsters\" (and for ease of understanding, they might also be thought of as happiness hogs). Nozick poses utility monsters justify their greediness with the notion that, compared to others, they experience greater inequality or sadness in the world, and deserve more happy units to bridge this gap. People not part of the utility monster group (or not the utility monster individual themselves) are left with less happy units to be split among the members. Utility monsters state that the others are happier in the world to begin with, so they would not need those extra happy units to which they lay claim anyway.\n\nThe utility monster has been invoked in debates about free speech. Advocates for laws against hate speech, flag-burning, and blasphemy have been accused of becoming utility monsters in order to increase society's willingness to support their policies.\n\nThe utility monster has been invoked in debates about population. Derek Parfit's mere addition paradox suggests that additional humans would add to total happiness, even if expanding population decreases average happiness. Opposite reasoning yields the \"repugnant conclusion\" that the world would be better off with one extremely happy person. Parfit suggests that Nozick's utility monster is misleading because it appeals to our intuitions about a being which experiences more than a million times the utility of a very well-off ordinary person, which is, he thinks, inconceivable. The implication is a more common-sense continuous scale of happiness change, from great to nil, based on scarcity of units, the happiness increasing from an additional unit of resource only inversely proportional to the existing pool of units.\n\nThe reason this can come to be, and the reason the utility monster is a condition of utilitarianism in effect, is because the philosophy necessarily begs the question of how to measure happiness. A person can be in much grief, but there is no physical way to measure the lack of happiness they experience, and whether this is greater or less than a person who is enduring a different pain, like physical torture. Rephrased, this brings to light the question of which person is more deserving and which person is less deserving of happiness units based on life experiences. Individuals must take other's word regarding how much happiness they each possess, and the happiness they should therefore be able to lay claim. It is a common idea among people that hurt individuals deserve compensation for their pain. Yet Nozick's utility monster would take advantage of this reward process, by proclaiming their pain is the greatest and most deserving of reward.\n\nJason Kuznicki argues the reverse is true. According to Kuznicki, this proposed justification negatively affects society, because people's demand for equal payment for life's pain creates these utility monsters. One such group he suggests comes in the form of people who seek political correctness. He states that these folks butcher other people's right to free speech, under the pretense that it causes their group (or their individual) pain. He states that it is unjustifiable that pain one causes another is greater than someone else's. He thus provides the example of censorship, where if one person finds a certain censorship offensive, while others do not, who's to say that the offended person's hurt is worthy of a law of censorship of that material to be created? Specifically, \"If 'feelings of upset' are to be taken into account in shaping our laws, why do my feelings, and the feelings of other libertarians, always count for nothing?\"\n\n"}
