{"id": "346360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=346360", "title": "Cuckoo clock", "text": "Cuckoo clock\n\nA cuckoo clock is a typically pendulum-regulated clock that strikes the hours with a sound like a common cuckoo's call and has an automated cuckoo bird that moves with each note. Some move their wings and open/close their beaks while leaning forward, whereas in others, only the bird's body leans forward. The mechanism to produce the cuckoo call has been in use since the middle of the 18th century and has remained almost without variation until the present.\n\nIt is unknown who invented it and where the first one was made. It is thought that much of its development and evolution was made in the Black Forest area in southwestern Germany (State of Baden-Württemberg), the region where the cuckoo clock was popularized. The cuckoo clocks were exported to the rest of the world from the mid 1850s on. Today, the cuckoo clock is one of the favourite souvenirs of travelers in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. It has become a cultural icon of Germany.\n\nThe design of a cuckoo clock is now conventional. Most are made in the \"traditional style\" (also known as \"carved\") or \"chalet\" to hang on a wall. In the \"traditional style\" the wooden case is decorated with carved leaves and animals. They have an automaton of the bird that appears through a small trap door while the clock is striking. The bird is often made to move as the clock strikes, typically by means of an arm that lifts the back of the carving.\n\nThere are two kinds of movements: one-day (30-hour) and eight-day clockworks. Some have musical devices, and play a tune on a Swiss music box after striking the hours and half-hours. Usually the melody sounds only at full hours in eight-day clocks and both at full and half hours in the one-day timepieces. Musical cuckoo clocks frequently have other automata which move when the music box plays. Today's cuckoo clocks are almost always weight driven, though a very few are spring driven. The weights are made of cast iron in a pine cone shape and the \"cuc-koo\" sound is created by two tiny gedackt pipes in the clock, with bellows attached to their tops. The clock's movement activates the bellows to send a puff of air into each pipe alternately when the timekeeper strikes.\n\nIn recent years, quartz battery-powered cuckoo clocks have become available. As with their mechanical counterparts, the cuckoo bird emerges from its enclosure and moves up and down, but on the quartz timepieces it also flaps its wings and open its beak while it sings. During the call the double doors open and the cuckoo emerges as usual, but only on the full hour, and they do not have a gong wire chime. The movement of the cuckoo in such clocks is regulated by an electromagnet that pulses on and off, attracting a weight, that acts as a fulcrum, connected to the tail of the plastic cuckoo bird, thus moving the bird up and down in his enclosure. Instead of the call being reproduced by the traditional bellows, it is a digital recording of a cuckoo calling in the wild (with a corresponding echo). The cuckoo call is usually accompanied by the sound of a waterfall and other birds in the background.\n\nIn musical quartz clocks, the hourly chime is followed by the replay of one of twelve popular melodies (one for each hour). Some musical quartz clocks also reproduce many of the popular automata found on mechanical musical clocks, such as beer drinkers, wood-choppers, and jumping deer.\n\nUniquely, quartz cuckoo clocks often include a sensor, so that when the lights are turned off at night they automatically silence the hourly chime. Other quartz cuckoo clocks are pre-programmed not to strike between a set of pre-determined hours. Whether this is controlled by a light sensor or pre-programmed, the function is referred to as a 'night silence' feature. On quartz clocks the weights are conventionally cast in the shape of Aleppo pine cones made of plastic rather than iron, as are as the cuckoo bird and clock hands. The pendulum bob is often another carved leaf. Here, the weights and pendulum are purely ornamental as the clock is driven by battery power. As with mechanical cuckoo clocks, the dial is usually small, and typically marked with Roman numerals.\n\nIn 1629, many decades before clockmaking was established in the Black Forest, an Augsburg nobleman by the name of Philipp Hainhofer (1578–1647) penned the first known description of a modern cuckoo clock. The clock belonged to Prince Elector August von Sachsen.\n\nLikewise, in a widely known handbook on music, \"Musurgia Universalis\" (1650), the scholar Athanasius Kircher describes a mechanical organ with several automated figures, including a mechanical cuckoo. This book contains the first documented description—in words and pictures—of how a mechanical cuckoo works. It should be noted that Kircher did not invent the cuckoo mechanism, because this book, like his other works, is a compilation of known facts into a handbook for reference purposes. The engraving clearly shows all the elements of a mechanical cuckoo. The bird automatically opens its beak and moves both its wings and tail. Simultaneously, there is heard the whistle—call of the cuckoo, created by two organ pipes, tuned to a minor or major third. There is only one fundamental difference from the Black Forest-type cuckoo mechanism: The functions of Kircher's bird are not governed by a count wheel in a strike train, but a pinned program barrel synchronizes the movements and sounds of the bird.\n\nOn the other hand, in 1669 Domenico Martinelli, in his handbook on elementary clocks \"Horologi Elementari\", suggests using the call of the cuckoo to indicate the hours. Starting at that time the mechanism of the cuckoo clock was known. Any mechanic or clockmaker, who could read Latin or Italian, knew after reading the books that it was feasible to have the cuckoo announce the hours.\n\nSubsequently, cuckoo clocks appeared in regions that had not been known for their clockmaking. For instance, the \"Historische Nachrichten\" (1713), an anonymous publication generally attributed to Court Preacher Bartholomäus Holzfuss, mentions a musical clock in the Oranienburg palace in Berlin. This clock, originating in West Prussia, played eight church hymns and had a cuckoo that announced the quarter hours. Unfortunately this clock, like the one mentioned by Hainhofer in 1629, can no longer be traced today.\n\nA few decades later, people in the Black Forest started to build cuckoo clocks.\n\nIt is not clear who built the first cuckoo clocks in the Black Forest but there is unanimity that the unusual clock with the bird call very quickly conquered the region. Already by the middle of the 18th century, several small clockmaking shops produced cuckoo clocks with wooden gears. So the first Black Forest examples were created between 1740 and 1750. The earliest Black Forest examples had shields decorated with paper.\n\nIt is hard to judge how large the proportion of cuckoo clocks was among the total production of modern movement Black Forest clocks. Based on the proportions of pieces surviving to the present, it must have been a small fraction of the total production.\n\nRegarding its murky origins, there are two main fables from the first two chroniclers of Black Forest horology which tell contradicting stories about it:\n\nThe first is from Father Franz Steyrer, written in his \"Geschichte der Schwarzwälder Uhrmacherkunst\" (History of the Art of Clockmaking in the Black Forest) in 1796. He describes a meeting between two clock peddlers from Furtwangen (a town in the Black Forest) who met a travelling Bohemian merchant who sold wooden cuckoo clocks. Both the Furtwangen traders were so excited that they bought one. On bringing it home they copied it and showed their imitation to other Black Forest clock traders. Its popularity grew in the region and more and more clockmakers started producing them. With regard to this chronicle, the historian Adolf Kistner claimed in his book \"Die Schwarzwälder Uhr\" (The Black Forest Clock) published in 1927, that there is not any Bohemian cuckoo clock in existence to verify the thesis that this clock was used as a sample to copy and produce Black Forest cuckoo clocks. Bohemia had no fundamental clockmaking industry during that period.\n\nThe second story is related by another priest, Markus Fidelis Jäck, in a passage extracted from his report \"Darstellungen aus der Industrie und des Verkehrs aus dem Schwarzwald\" (Descriptions of the Industry and the Traffic of the Black Forest), (1810) said as follows: \"The cuckoo clock was invented (in 1730) by a clock-master [Franz Anton Ketterer] from Schönwald [literally \"Beautiful Forest\", i.e. the Black Forest]. This craftsman adorned a clock with a moving bird that announced the hour with the cuckoo-call. The clock-master got the idea of how to make the cuckoo-call from the bellows of a church organ\". As time went on, the second version became the more popular, and is the one generally related today. Unfortunately, neither Steyrer nor Jäck quote any sources for their claims, making them unverifiable.\n\nOn the other side, R. Dorer pointed out, in 1948, that Franz Anton Ketterer (1734–1806) could not have been the inventor of the cuckoo clock in 1730 because he had not yet been born.\n\nThis statement was corroborated by Gerd Bender in the most recent edition of the first volume of his work \"Die Uhrenmacher des hohen Schwarzwaldes und ihre Werke\" (\"The Clockmakers of the High Black Forest and their Works\") (1998) in which he wrote that the cuckoo clock was not native to the Black Forest and also stated that: \"There are no traces of the first production line of cuckoo clocks made by Ketterer\".\n\nHowever, Schaaf in \"Schwarzwalduhren\" (\"Black Forest Clocks\") (1995), provides his own research which leads to the earliest cuckoos having been built in the \"Franken-Niederbayern\" area (\"Franconia and Lower Bavaria\", in the southeast of Germany, forming nowadays the northern two-thirds of the Free State of Bavaria), in the direction of Bohemia (nowadays the main region of the Czech Republic), which he notes, lends credence to the Steyrer version.\n\nThe legend that the cuckoo clock was invented by a clever Black Forest mechanic in 1730 (Franz Anton Ketterer) keeps being told over and over again. But all of this is not true. This type of clock is much older than clockmaking in the Black Forest. As early as 1650 the bird with the distinctive call was part of the reference book knowledge recorded in handbooks. It took nearly a century for the cuckoo clock to find its way to the Black Forest, where for many decades it remained a tiny niche product.\n\nAlthough the idea of placing an automaton cuckoo bird in a clock to announce the passing of time did not originate in the Black Forest, it is necessary to emphasize that the cuckoo clock as we know it today, comes from this region located in southwest Germany whose tradition of clockmaking started in the late 17th century. The Black Forest people who created the cuckoo clock industry developed it, and still come up with new designs and technical improvements which have made the cuckoo clock a valued work of art all over the world. The cuckoo clock history is linked to the Black Forest.\n\nEven though the functionality of the cuckoo mechanism has remained basically unchanged, the appearance has changed as case designs and clock movements evolved in the region. The now traditional Black Forest clock design, the \"Schilduhr\" (Shield-clock), was characterized by having a painted flat square wooden face behind which all the clockwork was attached. On top of the square was usually a semicircle of highly decorated painted wood which contained the door for the cuckoo. These usually depicted floral patterns (so-called \"Rosenuhren\", rose clocks) and often had a painted column, on either side of the chapter ring, others were decorated with illustrations of fruit as well. Some pieces also bore the names of the bride and bridegroom on the dial, which were normally painted by women. There was no cabinet surrounding the clockwork in this model. This design was the most prevalent between the end of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. These timekeepers were typically sold from door to door by \"Uhrenträger\" (Clock-peddlers, literally \"clock carriers\") who would carry the dials and movements on their backs displayed on huge backpacks.\n\nTowards the middle of the nineteenth century till the 1870s, cuckoo clocks were also manufactured in the Black Forest type of clock known as \"Rahmenuhr\" (Framed-clock). As the name suggests, these scarce wall cuckoo clocks consisted of a picture frame, usually with a typical Black Forest scene painted on a wooden background or a sheet metal, lithography and screen-printing were other techniques used. Other common themes depicted were; hunting, love, family, death, birth, mythology, military and Christian religious scenes. Works by painters such as Johann Baptist Laule (1817–1895) and Carl Heine (1842–1882) were used to decorate the fronts of this and other types of clocks. The painting was almost always protected by a glass and some models displayed a person or an animal with blinking or flirty eyes as well, being operated by a simple mechanism worked by means of the pendulum swinging. The cuckoo normally took part in the scene painted, and would pop out in 3D, as usual, to announce the hour.\n\nFrom the 1860s until the early 20th, cases were manufactured in a rich variety of styles such as; Biedermeier (some models also included a painting of a person or animal with moving eyes), Neoclassical or Georgian (certain pieces also displayed a painting), Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Art Nouveau, etc., becoming a suitable complementary piece for the bourgeois living room. These timepieces, based both on architectural and home decorative styles, are rarer than the popular ones looking like gatekeeper-houses (Bahnhäusle style clocks) and they could be mantel, wall or bracket clocks.\n\nBut the popular house-shaped Bahnhäusleuhr (Railroad house clock) virtually forced the discontinuation of other designs within a few decades.\n\nIn September 1850, the first director of the Grand Duchy of Baden Clockmakers School in Furtwangen, Robert Gerwig, launched a public competition to submit designs for modern clockcases, which would allow homemade products to attain a professional appearance.\n\nFriedrich Eisenlohr (1805–1854), who as an architect had been responsible for creating the buildings along the then new and first Badenese Rhine valley railway, submitted the most far-reaching design. Eisenlohr enhanced the facade of a standard railroad-guard's residence, as he had built many of them, with a clock dial. His \"Wallclock with shield decorated by ivy vines,\" (in reality the ornament were grapevines and not ivy) as it is referred to in a surviving, handwritten report from the Clockmakers School from 1851 or 1852, became the prototype of today's popular souvenir cuckoo clocks.\n\nEisenlohr was also up-to-date stylistically. He was inspired by local images; rather than copying them slavishly, he modified them. Contrary to most present-day cuckoo clocks, his case features light, unstained wood and were decorated with symmetrical, flat fretwork ornaments.\n\nEisenlohr's idea became an instant hit, because the modern design of the Bahnhäusle clock appealed to the decorating tastes of the growing bourgeoisie and thereby tapped into new and growing markets.\n\nWhile the Clockmakers School was satisfied to have Eisenlohr's clock case sketches, they were not fully realized in their original form. Eisenlohr had proposed a wooden facade; Gerwig preferred a painted metal front combined with an enamel dial. But despite intensive campaigns by the Clockmakers School, sheet metal fronts decorated with oil paintings (or coloured lithographs) never became a major market segment because of the high cost and labour-intensive process, hence only a few were produced (from the 1850s until around 1870), whether wall or mantel versions, and are nowadays sought-after collector pieces.\n\nCharacteristically, the makers of the first Bahnhäusle clocks deviated from Eisenlohr's sketch in only one way: they left out the cuckoo mechanism. Unlike today, the design with the little house was not synonymous with a cuckoo clock in the first years after 1850. This is another indication that at that time cuckoo clocks could not have been an important market segment.\n\nOnly in December 1854, Johann Baptist Beha, the best known maker of cuckoo clocks of his time, sold two of them, with oil paintings on their fronts, to the Furtwangen clock dealer Gordian Hettich, which were described as \"Bahnhöfle Uhren\" (\"Railroad station clocks\"). More than a year later, on January 20, 1856, another respected Furtwangen-based cuckoo clockmaker, Theodor Ketterer, sold one to Joseph Ruff in Glasgow (Scotland, United Kingdom).\n\nConcurrently with Beha and Ketterer, other Black Forest clockmakers must have started to equip Bahnhäusle clocks with cuckoo mechanisms to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for this type of clock. Starting in the mid-1850s there was a real boom in this market.\n\nBy 1860, the Bahnhäusle style had started to develop away from its original, \"severe\" graphic form, and evolve, among other designs, toward the well-known case with three-dimensional woodcarvings, like the \"Jagdstück\" (\"Hunt piece\", design created in Furtwangen in 1861), a cuckoo clock with carved oak foliage and hunting motives, such as trophy animals, guns and powder pouches.\n\nBy 1862 the reputed clockmaker Johann Baptist Beha, started to enhance his richly decorated Bahnhäusle clocks with hands carved from bone and weights cast in the shape of fir cones. Even today this combination of elements is characteristic for cuckoo clocks, although the hands are usually made of wood or plastic, white celluloid was employed in the past too. As for the weights, there was during this second half of the 19th century, a few models which featured weights cast in the shape of a Gnome and other curious forms.\n\nOnly ten years after its invention by Friedrich Eisenlohr, all variations of the house-theme had reached maturity. There were also Bahnhäusle timepieces and its derived manufactured as mantel clocks but not as many as the wall versions.\n\nThe basic cuckoo clock of today is the railway-house (Bahnhäusle) form, still with its rich ornamentation, and these are known under the name of \"traditional\" (or carved); which display carved leaves, birds, deer heads (Jagdstück design), other animals, etc. The richly decorated Bahnhäusle clocks have become a symbol of the Black Forest that is instantly understood anywhere in the world.\n\nThe cuckoo clock became successful and world-famous after Friedrich Eisenlohr contributed the Bahnhäusle design to the 1850 competition at the Furtwangen Clockmakers School.\n\nThe \"Chalet\" style originated at the end of the 19th century in Switzerland, at that time they were highly valued as souvenirs. Indeed, music and jewellery boxes of several sizes as well as timepieces were manufactured in the shape of a typical Swiss chalet, some of those clocks had also the added feature of a cuckoo bird and other automata. In the English-speaking world, cuckoo clocks are sufficiently identified with Switzerland that the film The Third Man has a oft-quoted speech (and it even had antecedents) in which the villainous Harry Lime mockingly says that \"in Switzerland they had brotherly love. They had 500 years of democracy and peace. And what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.\"\n\nThere are three basic styles, named after the type of traditional house depicted: Black Forest chalet, Swiss chalet (with two types the \"Brienz\" and the \"Emmental\"), and finally the Bavarian chalet. The only genuine Swiss chalet cuckoo clock maker in existence today is Loetscher AG. \n\nAlong with the common projecting bird, it may also display other types of animated figurines, examples include woodcutters, moving beer drinkers and turning water wheels. Some \"traditional\" style cuckoo clocks feature a music box and dancing figurines too.\n\nThe early 21st century has seen a revitalization of this ancient icon with designs, materials, technologies, shapes and colors never seen before in cuckoo clock manufacturing. These timekeepers are distinguished by its functional, schematic and minimalist aesthetic.\n\nAlthough simplified designs with simple, clear lines had already been produced in the 20th century, the real boom of seeing the cuckoo clock as a designer item, where the creativity and talent of designers are freely expressed and where the only limit seems to be imagination, was initiated in the 2000s (the first examples dating back to the 1990s), particularly in Italy and Germany.\n\nAs for the models, there are a great variety, many of them avant-garde and adventurous creations made of different materials and geometric shapes, such as rhombuses, squares, cubes, circles, rectangles, ovals, etc. Without carving, these clocks are usually flat and smooth. Some are painted in a single colour while others are polychromes with abstract or figurative paintings, multicolour lines and stripes, others include text and phrases, etc. About the clockwork, there are quartz, mechanical and sometimes, digital.\n\nIn Europe, museums that display collections are the Cuckooland Museum in the UK, and the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum and Dorf- und Uhrenmuseum Gütenbach in Germany. One of the biggest private collections in the United States that are open to the public located in Minneapolis. It contains more than 300 cuckoo clocks.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "226375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226375", "title": "De Stijl", "text": "De Stijl\n\nDe Stijl (; ), Dutch for \"The Style\", also known as Neoplasticism, was a Dutch artistic movement founded in 1917 in Leiden. De Stijl consisted of artists and architects. In a narrower sense, the term \"De Stijl\" is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the Netherlands. Proponents of De Stijl advocated pure abstraction and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to vertical and horizontal, using only black, white and primary colors.\n\n\"De Stijl\" is also the name of a journal that was published by the Dutch painter, designer, writer, and critic Theo van Doesburg that served to propagate the group's theories. Along with Theo van Doesburg, the group's principal members were the painters Piet Mondrian, Vilmos Huszár, and Bart van der Leck, and the architects Gerrit Rietveld, Robert van 't Hoff, and J. J. P. Oud. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as \"Neoplasticism\"—the new plastic art (or \"Nieuwe Beelding\" in Dutch).\n\nAccording to Theo van Doesburg in the introduction of the magazine \"De Stijl\" 1917 no.1, the \"De Stijl\"-movement was a reaction to the \"Modern Baroque\" of the Amsterdam School movement (Dutch expressionist architecture) with the magazine \"Wendingen\" (1918-1931).\n\nMondrian sets forth the delimitations of Neoplasticism in his essay \"Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art\". He writes, \"this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour\". With these constraints, his art allows only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. The De Stijl movement posited the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines.\n\nThe name De Stijl is supposedly derived from Gottfried Semper's \"Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Künsten oder Praktische Ästhetik\" (1861–3), which Curl suggests was mistakenly believed to advocate materialism and functionalism. The \"plastic vision\" of De Stijl artists, also called Neo-Plasticism, saw itself as reaching beyond the changing appearance of natural things to bring an audience into intimate contact with an immutable core of reality, a reality that was not so much a visible fact as an underlying spiritual vision. In general, De Stijl proposed ultimate simplicity and abstraction, both in architecture and painting, by using only straight horizontal and vertical lines and rectangular forms. Furthermore, their formal vocabulary was limited to the primary colours, red, yellow, and blue, and the three primary values, black, white, and grey. The works avoided symmetry and attained aesthetic balance by the use of opposition. This element of the movement embodies the second meaning of \"stijl\": \"a post, jamb or support\"; this is best exemplified by the construction of crossing joints, most commonly seen in carpentry.\n\nIn many of the group's three-dimensional works, vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. This feature can be found in the Rietveld Schröder House and the Red and Blue Chair.\n\nDe Stijl was influenced by Cubist painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about \"ideal\" geometric forms (such as the \"perfect straight line\") in the neoplatonic philosophy of mathematician M. H. J. Schoenmaekers. The De Stijl movement was also influenced by Neopositivism. The works of De Stijl would influence the Bauhaus style and the international style of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an \"-ism\" (e.g., Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like the Bauhaus; it was a collective project, a joint enterprise.\n\nIn music, De Stijl was an influence only on the work of composer Jakob van Domselaer, a close friend of Mondrian. Between 1913 and 1916, he composed his \"Proeven van Stijlkunst\" (\"Experiments in Artistic Style\"), inspired mainly by Mondrian's paintings. This minimalistic—and, at the time, revolutionary—music defined \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" musical elements and aimed at balancing those two principles. Van Domselaer was relatively unknown in his lifetime, and did not play a significant role within De Stijl.\n\nFrom the flurry of new art movements that followed the Impressionist revolutionary new perception of painting, Cubism arose in the early 20th century as an important and influential new direction. In the Netherlands, too, there was interest in this \"new art\".\n\nHowever, because the Netherlands remained neutral in World War I, Dutch artists were not able to leave the country after 1914 and were thus effectively isolated from the international art world—and in particular, from Paris, which was its centre then.\n\nDuring that period, Theo van Doesburg started looking for other artists to set up a journal and start an art movement. Van Doesburg was also a writer, poet, and critic, who had been more successful writing about art than working as an independent artist. Quite adept at making new contacts due to his flamboyant personality and outgoing nature, he had many useful connections in the art world.\n\nAround 1915, Van Doesburg started meeting the artists who would eventually become the founders of the journal. He first met Piet Mondrian at an exhibition in Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. Mondrian, who had moved to Paris in 1912 (and there, changed his name from \"Mondriaan\"), had been visiting the Netherlands when war broke out. He could not return to Paris, and was staying in the artists' community of Laren, where he met Bart van der Leck and regularly saw M. H. J. Schoenmaekers. In 1915, Schoenmaekers published \"Het nieuwe wereldbeeld\" (\"The New Image of the World\"), followed in 1916 by \"Beginselen der beeldende wiskunde\" (\"Principles of Plastic Mathematics\"). These two publications would greatly influence Mondrian and other members of De Stijl.\n\nVan Doesburg also knew J. J. P. Oud and the Hungarian artist Vilmos Huszár. In 1917 the cooperation of these artists, together with the poet Anthony Kok, resulted in the founding of De Stijl. The young architect Gerrit Rietveld joined the group in 1918. At its height De Stijl had 100 members and the journal had a circulation of 300.\n\nDuring those first few years, the group was still relatively homogeneous, although Van der Leck left in 1918 due to artistic differences of opinion. Manifestos were being published, signed by all members. The social and economic circumstances of the time formed an important source of inspiration for their theories, and their ideas about architecture were heavily influenced by Berlage and Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nThe name \"Nieuwe Beelding\" was a term first coined in 1917 by Mondrian, who wrote a series of twelve articles called \"De Nieuwe Beelding in de schilderkunst\" (\"Neo-Plasticism in Painting\") that were published in the journal \"De Stijl\". In 1920 he published a book titled \"Le Néo-Plasticisme\".\n\nAround 1921, the group's character started to change. From the time of van Doesburg's association with Bauhaus, other influences started playing a role. These influences were mainly Malevich and Russian Constructivism, to which not all members agreed. In 1924 Mondrian broke with the group after van Doesburg proposed the theory of elementarism, suggesting that a diagonal line is more vital than horizontal and vertical ones. In addition, the De Stijl group acquired many new \"members\". Dadaist influences, such as I. K. Bonset's poetry and Aldo Camini's \"antiphilosophy\" generated controversy as well. Only after Van Doesburg's death was it revealed that Bonset and Camini were two of his pseudonyms.\n\nTheo van Doesburg died in Davos, Switzerland, in 1931. His wife, Nelly, administered his estate.\n\nBecause of van Doesburg's pivotal role within De Stijl, the group did not survive. Individual members remained in contact, but De Stijl could not exist without a strong central character. Thus, it may be wrong to think of De Stijl as a close-knit group of artists. The members knew each other, but most communication took place by letter. For example, Mondrian and Rietveld never met in person.\n\nMany, though not all, artists did stay true to the movement's basic ideas, even after 1931. Rietveld, for instance, continued designing furniture according to De Stijl principles, while Mondrian continued working in the style he had initiated around 1920. Van der Leck, on the other hand, went back to figurative compositions after his departure from the group.\n\nThe De Stijl influence on architecture remained considerable long after its inception; Mies van der Rohe was among the most important proponents of its ideas. Between 1923 and 1924, Rietveld designed the Rietveld Schröder House, the only building to have been created completely according to De Stijl principles. Examples of Stijl-influenced works by J.J.P. Oud can be found in Rotterdam (\"\") and Hoek van Holland. Other examples include the Eames House by Charles and Ray Eames, and the interior decoration for the Aubette dance hall in Strasbourg, designed by Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Jean Arp and van Doesburg.\n\nWorks by De Stijl members are scattered all over the world, but De Stijl-themed exhibitions are organised regularly. Museums with large De Stijl collections include the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague (which owns the world's most extensive, although not exclusively De Stijl-related, Mondrian collection) and Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum, where many works by Rietveld and Van Doesburg are on display. The Museum of Utrecht has the largest Rietveld collection worldwide; it also owns the Rietveld Schröder House, Rietveld's adjacent \"show house\", and the Rietveld Schröder Archives.\n\nThe movement inspired the design aesthetics of Rumyantsevo and Salaryevo stations of Moscow Metro opened in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2662359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2662359", "title": "Decimal time", "text": "Decimal time\n\nDecimal time is the representation of the time of day using units which are decimally related. This term is often used specifically to refer to French Revolutionary Time, used in France for a few years beginning in 1792 during the French Revolution, which divided the day into 10 decimal hours, each decimal hour into 100 decimal minutes and each decimal minute into 100 decimal seconds, as opposed to the more familiar UTC Time standard, which divides the day into 24 hours, each hour into 60 minutes and each minute into 60 seconds.\n\nThe main advantage of a decimal time system is that, since the base used to divide the time is the same as the one used to represent it, the whole time representation can be handled as a single string. Therefore, it becomes simpler to interpret a timestamp and to perform conversions. For instance, 1:23:00 is 1 decimal hour and 23 decimal minutes, or 1.23 hours, or 123 minutes; 3 hours is 300 minutes or 30,000 seconds.\nThis property also makes it straightforward to represent a timestamp as a fractional day, so that .534 can be interpreted as five decimal hours and 34 decimal minutes after the start of that day, or 0.534 (53.4%) of a day through that day. It also adjusts well to digital time representation using epochs, in that the internal time representation can be used directly both for computation and for user-facing display.\n\nDecimal time was used in China throughout most of its history alongside duodecimal time. The midnight-to-midnight day was divided both into 12 double hours () and also into 10 shi / 100 \"ke\" () by the 1st millennium BC. Other numbers of \"ke\" per day were used during three short periods: 120 \"ke\" from 5–3 BC, 96 \"ke\" from 507–544 CE, and 108 \"ke\" from 544–565. Several of the roughly 50 Chinese calendars also divided each \"ke\" into 100 \"fen\", although others divided each \"ke\" into 60 \"fen\". In 1280, the \"Shoushi\" (Season Granting) calendar further subdivided each \"fen\" into 100 \"miao\", creating a complete decimal time system of 100 \"ke\", 100 \"fen\" and 100 \"miao\". Chinese decimal time ceased to be used in 1645 when the \"Shixian\" (Constant Conformity) calendar, based on European astronomy and brought to China by the Jesuits, adopted 96 \"ke\" per day alongside 12 double hours, making each \"ke\" exactly one-quarter hour.\n\nIn 1754, Jean le Rond d'Alembert wrote in the \"Encyclopédie\":\nIn 1788, Claude Boniface Collignon proposed dividing the day into 10 hours or 1000 minutes, each new hour into 100 minutes, each new minute into 1000 seconds, and each new second into 1000 \"tierces\" (Latin for \"third\"). The distance the twilight zone travels in one such \"tierce\" at the equator, which would be one-billionth of the circumference of the earth, would be a new unit of length, provisionally called a half-handbreadth, equal to four modern centimetres. Further, the new \"tierce\" would be divided into 1000 \"quatierces\", which he called \"microscopic points of time\". He also suggested a week of 10 days and dividing the year into 10 \"solar months\".\n\nDecimal time was officially introduced during the French Revolution. Jean-Charles de Borda made a proposal for decimal time on November 5, 1792. The National Convention issued a decree on 5 October 1793:\n\nThese parts were named on 24 November 1793 (4 Frimaire of the Year II). The primary divisions were called hours, and they added:\n\nThus, midnight was called either \"dix heures\" (10 o'clock) or \"zero heures\" (0 o'clock), noon was called \"cinq heures\" (5 o'clock), etc. Units were either written out or abbreviated, such as 8 h. 72 m. Sometimes in official records, decimal hours were divided into tenths, or \"décimes\", instead of minutes. Although clocks and watches were produced with faces showing both standard time with numbers 1–24 and decimal time with numbers 1–10, decimal time never caught on; it was not officially used until the beginning of the Republican year III, 22 September 1794, and mandatory use was suspended 7 April 1795 (18 Germinal of the Year III), in the same law which introduced the original metric system. Thus, although decimal time is sometimes referred to as metric time, the metric system at first had no time unit, and later versions of the metric system used the second, equal to 1/86400 day, as the metric time unit. In spite of this, decimal time was used in many cities, including Marseille and Toulouse, where a decimal clock with just an hour hand was on the front of the Capitole for five years. On the Palace of the Tuileries in Paris, two of the four clock faces displayed decimal time until at least 1801. The mathematician and astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace had a decimal watch made for him, and used decimal time in his work, in the form of fractional days. Because of this, astronomers still use decimal time.\n\nDecimal time was part of a larger attempt at decimalisation in revolutionary France (which also included decimalisation of currency and metrication) and was introduced as part of the French Republican Calendar, which, in addition to decimally dividing the day, divided the month into three \"décades\" of 10 days each; this calendar was abolished at the end of 1805. The start of each year was determined according to the day of the autumnal equinox, in relation to true or apparent solar time at the Paris Observatory. Decimal time would also have been reckoned according to apparent solar time, depending on the location it was observed, as was already the practice generally for the setting of clocks. :: GMT is\n0h\n6m\n49s\ndecimal time in Paris.\n\nAt the International Meridian Conference of 1884, the following resolution was proposed by the French delegation and passed nem con (with 3 abstentions):\n\nIn the 1890s, Joseph Charles François de Rey-Pailhade, president of the Toulouse Geographical Society, proposed dividing the day into 100 parts, called \"cés\", equal to 14.4 standard minutes, and each divided into 10 \"decicés\", 100 \"centicés\", etc. The Toulouse Chamber of Commerce adopted a resolution supporting his proposal in April 1897. Although widely published, the proposal received little backing.\n\nThe French made another attempt at the decimalization of time in 1897, when the \"Commission de décimalisation du temps\" was created by the Bureau des Longitudes, with the mathematician Henri Poincaré as secretary. The commission adopted a compromise, originally proposed by Henri de Sarrauton of the Oran Geographical Society, of retaining the 24-hour day, but dividing each hour into 100 decimal minutes, and each minute into 100 seconds. The plan did not gain acceptance and was abandoned in 1900.\n\nOn 23 October 1998, the Swiss watch company Swatch introduced a decimal time called Internet Time, which divides the day into 1,000 decimal minutes (Swatch called them \".beats\"), (each 86.4 seconds in standard time) counted from 000–999, with @000 being midnight and @500 being noon standard time in Switzerland, which is Central European Time (one hour ahead of Universal Time). A line painted on Swatch headquarters in the Swiss city of Biel (now Biel/Bienne) was declared to mark the Biel Meridian, and Central European Time was relabelled as \"Biel Meantime\" (BMT), even though it does not correspond to actual local mean time in Biel.\n\nThere are exactly 86,400 standard seconds (see SI for the current definition of the standard second) in a standard day, but in the French decimal time system there were 100,000 decimal seconds in the day, so the decimal second was shorter than its counterpart.\nAnother common type of decimal time is decimal hours. In 1896, Henri de Sarrauton of the Oran Geographical Society proposed dividing the 24 hours of the day each into 100 decimal minutes, and each minute into 100 decimal seconds. Although endorsed by the Bureau des Longitudes, this proposal failed, but using decimal fractions of an hour to represent the time of day instead of minutes has become common.\n\nDecimal hours are frequently used in accounting for payrolls and hourly billing. Time clocks typically record the time of day in tenths or hundredths of an hour. For instance, 8:30 am would be recorded as 08.50. This is intended to make accounting easier by eliminating the need to convert between minutes and hours.\n\nFor aviation purposes, where it is common to add times in an already complicated environment, time tracking is simplified by recording decimal fractions of hours. For instance, instead of adding 1:36 to 2:36, getting 3:72 and converting it to 4:12, one would add 1.6 to 2.6 and get 4.2 hours.\n\nThe time of day is sometimes represented as a decimal fraction of a day in science and computers. Standard 24-hour time is converted into a fractional day by dividing the number of hours elapsed since midnight by 24 to make a decimal fraction. Thus, midnight is 0.0 day, noon is 0.5 d, etc., which can be added to any type of date, including (all of which refer to the same moment):\n\nAs many decimal places may be used as required for precision, so 0.5 d = 0.500000 d. Fractional days are often calculated in UTC or TT, although Julian Dates use pre-1925 astronomical date/time (each date began at noon = \".0\") and Microsoft Excel uses the local time zone of the computer. Using fractional days reduces the number of units in time calculations from four (days, hours, minutes, seconds) to just one (days).\n\nFractional days are often used by astronomers to record observations, and were expressed in relation to Paris Mean Time by the 18th century French mathematician and astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace, as in these examples:\n\nFractional days have been used by astronomers ever since. For instance, the 19th century British astronomer John Herschel gave these examples:\n\nFractional days are commonly used to express epochs of orbital elements. The decimal fraction is usually added to the calendar date or Julian day for natural objects, or to the ordinal date for artificial satellites in two-line elements.\n\nThe second is the International System of Units (SI) unit of time duration. It is also the standard single-unit time representation in many programming languages, most notably C, and part of UNIX/POSIX standards used by Linux, Mac OS X, etc.; to convert fractional days to fractional seconds, multiply the number by 86400. Fractional seconds are represented as milliseconds (ms), microseconds (μs) or nanoseconds (ns). Absolute times are usually represented relative to 1 January 1970, at midnight. Other systems may use a different zero point (a.k.a. Epoch).\n\nIn principle, time spans greater than one second are given in units such as kiloseconds (ks), myriasecond (mys), megaseconds (Ms), gigaseconds (Gs), and so on. (The myriasecond is based on the \"myria-\" prefix, which represented a multiple of 10000 but was made obsolete in the mid-20th century.) Occasionally, these units can be found in technical literature, but traditional units like minutes, hours, days and years are much more common, and are accepted for use with SI.\n\nIt is possible to specify the time of day as the number of kiloseconds or myriaseconds elapsed since midnight. Thus, instead of saying 3:45 p.m. one could say (time of day) 56.7 ks. There are exactly 86.4 ks or 8.64 mys in one day. However, this nomenclature is rarely used in practice.\n\nScientists often record (rather than observe) time as decimals. For example, decimal days divides the day into 10 equal parts, and decimal years divides the year into 10 equal parts. Decimals are easier to plot than both (a) minutes and seconds, which uses the Sexagesimal numbering system, (b) hours, months and days, which has irregular month lengths. In astronomy, the so-called Julian day uses decimal days centered on noon.\nSince there are 60 seconds in a minute, a tenth part represents 60/10 = 6 seconds.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, a tenth part represents 60/10 = 6 minutes.\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, a tenth part represents 24/10 = 2.4 hours (2 hours and 24 minutes).\nSince there are about 365 days in a year, there are about 365/10 = 36.5 days in a tenth of a year. Hence the year 2000.5 represents the day 2 July 2000. More exactly, a Julian year is exactly 365.25 days long, so a tenth of the year is 36.525 days (36 days, 12 hours, 36 minutes).\nThese values, based on the Julian year, are most likely to be those used in astronomy and related sciences. A Gregorian year, which takes into account the 100/400 leap year rules of the Gregorian calendar, is 365.2425 days (the average length of a year over a 400-year cycle), resulting in 0.1 years being a period of 36.52425 days (3155695.2 seconds; 36 days, 12 hours, 34 minutes, 55.2 seconds).\n\nNumerous individuals have proposed variations of decimal time, dividing the day into different numbers of units and subunits with different names. Most are based upon fractional days, so that one decimal time format may be easily converted into another, such that all the following are equivalent:\n\n\nSome decimal time proposals are based upon alternate units of metric time. The difference between metric time and decimal time is that metric time defines units for measuring time interval, as measured with a stopwatch, and decimal time defines the time of day, as measured by a clock. Just as standard time uses the metric time unit of the second as its basis, proposed decimal time scales may use alternative metric units.\n\n\n\n"}

The cognitive bias of illusory superiority comes from the inability of low-ability people to recognize their lack of ability. Without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.\n\nAs described by social psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger, the cognitive bias of illusory superiority results from an internal illusion in people of low ability and from an external misperception in people of high ability; that is, \"the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others.\"\n\nThe psychological phenomenon of illusory superiority was identified as a form of cognitive bias in Kruger and Dunning's 1999 study \"Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments\". The identification derived from the cognitive bias evident in the criminal case of McArthur Wheeler, who robbed banks with his face covered with lemon juice, which he believed would make it invisible to the surveillance cameras. This belief was based on his misunderstanding of the chemical properties of lemon juice as an invisible ink.\n\nOther investigations of the phenomenon, such as \"Why People Fail to Recognize Their Own Incompetence\" (2003), indicate that much incorrect self-assessment of competence derives from the person's ignorance of a given activity's standards of performance. Dunning and Kruger's research also indicates that training in a task, such as solving a logic puzzle, increases people's ability to accurately evaluate how good they are at it.\n\nIn \"Self-insight: Roadblocks and Detours on the Path to Knowing Thyself\" (2005), Dunning described the Dunning–Kruger effect as \"the anosognosia of everyday life\", referring to a neurological condition in which a disabled person either denies or seems unaware of his or her disability. He stated: \"If you're incompetent, you can't know you're incompetent ... The skills you need to produce a right answer are exactly the skills you need to recognize what a right answer is.\"\n\nDunning and Kruger tested the hypotheses of the cognitive bias of illusory superiority on undergraduate students of introductory courses in psychology by examining the students' self-assessments of their intellectual skills in logical reasoning (inductive, deductive, abductive), English grammar, and personal sense of humor. After learning their self-assessment scores, the students were asked to estimate their ranks in the psychology class. The competent students underestimated their class rank, and the incompetent students overestimated theirs, but the incompetent students did not estimate their class rank as higher than the ranks estimated by the competent group. Across four studies, the research indicated that the study participants who scored in the bottom quartile on tests of their sense of humor, knowledge of grammar, and logical reasoning overestimated their test performance and their abilities; despite test scores that placed them in the 12th percentile, the participants estimated they ranked in the 62nd percentile.\n\nMoreover, competent students tended to underestimate their own competence, because they erroneously presumed that tasks easy for them to perform were also easy for other people to perform. Incompetent students improved their ability to correctly estimate their class rank after receiving minimal tutoring in the skills they previously lacked, regardless of any objective improvement gained in said skills of perception. The study \"Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-estimated Ability\" (2004) extended the cognitive-bias premise of illusory superiority to test the subjects' emotional sensitivity toward other people and their perceptions of other people.\n\nThe study \"How Chronic Self-Views Influence (and Potentially Mislead) Estimates of Performance\" (2003) indicated a shift in the participants' view of themselves when influenced by external cues. The participants' knowledge of geography was tested; some tests were intended to positively affect the participant's self-view and some were intended to affect it negatively. The participants then were asked to rate their performances; the participants given tests with a positive intent reported better performance than did the participants given tests with a negative intent.\n\nTo test Dunning and Kruger's hypotheses, \"that people, at all performance levels, are equally poor at estimating their relative performance\", the study \"Skilled or Unskilled, but Still Unaware of It: How Perceptions of Difficulty Drive Miscalibration in Relative Comparisons\" (2006) investigated three studies that manipulated the \"perceived difficulty of the tasks, and, hence, [the] participants' beliefs about their relative standing\". The investigation indicated that when the experimental subjects were presented with moderately difficult tasks, there was little variation among the best performers and the worst performers in their ability to accurately predict their performance. With more difficult tasks, the best performers were less accurate in predicting their performance than were the worst performers. Therefore, judges at all levels of skill are subject to similar degrees of error in the performance of tasks.\n\nIn testing alternative explanations for the cognitive bias of illusory superiority, the study \"Why the Unskilled are Unaware: Further Explorations of (Absent) Self-insight Among the Incompetent \"(2008) reached the same conclusions as previous studies of the Dunning–Kruger effect: that, in contrast to high performers, \"poor performers do not learn from feedback suggesting a need to improve\".\n\nTwo unique papers in \"Numeracy\" reveal problems with the graphic introduced in the 1999 Kruger and Dunning paper. Subsequent researchers used it, (\"y\" − \"x\") \"versus\" (\"x\") scatter plots, and related variants for nearly two decades. The authors show how a major part of the body of literature that used these approaches seem to have mistaken and interpreted mathematical artifacts as the products of human behavior. The two papers employed paired, well-aligned instruments of known reliability to examine the evaluation of self-assessment measures from the perspective of signal and noise. They show how the mathematical problems inherent in the Kruger–Dunning type graph can be overcome by other kinds of graphing that attenuate noise or employ categorical data from known novices and experts. When artifacts are eliminated, the evidence is strong that humans are generally correct in their self-assessments, with only a small percentage of the participants who were studied exhibiting performance that might merit the label \"unskilled and unaware of it\". The authors' findings refute the claim that humans, in general, are prone to having greatly inflated views of their abilities, but they support two other tenets of the original Kruger and Dunning research: (1) that self-assessment skill can be learned and (2) experts usually self-assess themselves with better accuracy than do novices. The researchers noted that metacognitive self-assessment skill is of great value, and that it can be taught together with any disciplinary content in college courses.\n\nStudies of the Dunning–Kruger effect usually have been of North Americans, but studies of Japanese people suggest that cultural forces have a role in the occurrence of the effect. The study \"Divergent Consequences of Success and Failure in Japan and North America: An Investigation of Self-improving Motivations and Malleable Selves\" (2001) indicated that Japanese people tended to underestimate their abilities, and tended to see underachievement (failure) as an opportunity to improve their abilities at a given task, thereby increasing their value to the social group.\n\nIn 2000, Kruger and Dunning were awarded an Ig Nobel Prize, in satirical recognition of the scientific work recorded in \"their modest report\".\n\n\"The Dunning-Kruger Song\" is part of \"The Incompetence Opera\", a mini-opera that premiered at the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony in 2017. The mini-opera is billed as \"a musical encounter with the Peter principle and the Dunning-Kruger Effect\".\n\nAlthough the Dunning–Kruger effect was formulated in 1999, the cognitive bias of illusory superiority has been known throughout history and identified by intellectuals, such as: \n"}

Economic, social and cultural rights are recognised and protected in international and regional human rights instruments. Member states have a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil economic, social and cultural rights and are expected to take \"progressive action\" towards their fulfilment.\n\nThe Universal Declaration on Human Rights recognises a number of economic, social and cultural rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) is the primary international legal source of economic, social and cultural rights. The Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women recognises and protects many of the economic, social and cultural rights recognised in the ICESCR in relation to children and women. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination prohibits discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin in relation to a number of economic, social and cultural rights. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also prohibits all discrimination on the basis of the disability including refusal of the reasonable accommodation relating to full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.\n\nEconomic, social and cultural rights are recognized and protected in a number of international and regional human rights instruments.\n\nThe Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, is one of the most important sources of economic, social and cultural rights. It recognizes the right to social security in Article 22, the right to work in Article 23, the right to rest and leisure in Article 24, the right to an adequate standard of living in Article 25, the right to education in Article 26, and the right to benefits of science and culture in Article 27.\n\nThe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) is the primary international legal source of economic, social and cultural rights. The Covenant recognized and protects the right to work and to just and favorable working conditions in Article 6 and 7, the right to join trade unions and take collective labor action in Article 8, the right to social security in Article 9, the right to protection of the family, including protection for mothers and children, in Article 10, the right to an adequate standard of living, including the right to food and the right to housing, in Article 11, the right to health in Article 12, the right to education in Article 13, as well as the right to participate in cultural life and the right to benefits of science and culture in Article 15. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted at the same time as the ICESCR, recognizes and protects a number of core economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to join trade unions in Article 22, and the right of ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities to engage in their culture, practice their religion and use their language in Article 27.\n\nA number of other major international human rights instruments contain provisions relating to economic, social and cultural rights. The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes and protects many of the economic, social and cultural rights recognized in the ICESCR in relation to children. Including the right to health in Article 24, the right to social security in Article 25, the right to an adequate standard of living in Article 27, the right to education in Article 28, and the right to protection from economic exploitation (see child labour) in Article 32. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination prohibits discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin in relation to a number of economic, social and cultural rights. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women affirms a range of economic, social and cultural rights to women. The ILO Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) protect a range of work related economic, social and cultural rights.\n\nThe African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights protects the right to work in Article 15, the right to health in Article 16, and the right to education in Article 17. The European Social Charter protects a wide range of economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to work, to favourable working conditions, the right to join trade unions and to take collective labour action in Article 1 to 10, the right to health in Article 11, the right to social security, including the right to medical assistance and the right to social welfare services, in Article 12 to 14, protection of especially vulnerable groups are enshrined in Article 15 to 17 and 19, and right to housing in Article 31. The Protocol of San Salvador protects a range of economic, social and cultural rights within the Inter-American human rights system.\n\nA range of secondary legal sources exist on economic, social and cultural rights which provide guidance on their normative definition. An important secondary legal source is the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which is overseeing the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). The Committee has been central in developing the normative definition of key economic, social and cultural rights, interpreting the role of State Parties to the ICESCR, and monitoring protection and violation of the ICESCR rights. The Committee issues guiding pronouncements in the form of \"general comments\", and other human rights treaty bodies may also issue comments relevant to economic, social and cultural rights.\n\nOther important secondary legal sources on economic, social and cultural rights are the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1987 and the Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1997. The Limburg Principles have been extensively used in national legal systems as an interpretive tool for establishing violations of economic, social and cultural rights. The Maastricht Guidelines build on the Limburg Principles and identify the legal implications of acts and omissions which are violations of economic, social and cultural rights. Various United Nations Special Rapporteurs have influenced the normative development of economic, social and cultural rights. Appointed by the Commission on Human Rights and its sub-commissions, key rapporteurs include the Special Rapporteur on the Realization of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, and the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women.\n\nA number of national constitutions recognize economic, social and cultural rights. For example, the 1996 Constitution of South Africa includes economic, social and cultural rights and the South African Constitutional Court has heard claims under these obligations (see \"Grootboom\" and \"Treatment Action Campaign\" cases). India's constitution, which does not explicitly recognize economic and social rights in their constitution, has nonetheless found that these rights exist, though unenumerated, inferable from the right to life. \n\nEconomic, social and cultural right enshrined in international and regional human rights instruments are legally binding. Member states have a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil these rights. The exact nature of states' obligations in this respect has been established principally in relation to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and further Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has been established in accordance with Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action\n\nState parties to the ICESCR are required to take \"progressive action\" towards fulfilment of the ICESR rights. While immediate fulfilment may not be possible due to the economic situation of a country, postponement of proactive action is not permitted. State parties must show genuine efforts to secure the economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in the ICESCR. The burden of proof for progressive action is considered on be with the state party. The prohibition on discrimination in relation to economic, social and cultural rights is regarded as having immediate effect. State parties must abolish laws, policies and practices which affect the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and take action to prevent discrimination in public life. All state parties, regardless of the economic situation in the country or resource scarcity, are required to ensure respect for minimum subsistence rights for all. State parties must also ensure that available resources are accessed and used equitably. Therefore, government decisions on how to allocate resources should be subject to scrutiny. Legislative measures alone are not sufficient to ensure compliance with the ICESCR and state parties are expected to provide judicial remedies in addition to taking administrative, financial, educational and social measures.\n\nIntergovernmental organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have persistently neglected economic, social and cultural rights over the past 50 years. While all human rights are said to be \"equal, indivisible, interrelated, and interdependent\", the monitoring, enforcement and implementation framework for economic, social and cultural rights is less advanced than that for civil and political rights. International enforcement mechanisms are strongest for civil and political rights, and their violation is considered more serious than that of economic, social and cultural rights. There are few international NGOs that focus on economic, social and cultural rights and there are few lawyers who have the knowledge or experience to defend economic, social and cultural rights at a national or international level. Economic, social and cultural rights are less likely than civil and political rights to be protected in national constitutions.\n\nIn 2008, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which gives the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights competence to receive and consider communications from individuals claiming that their rights under the Covenant have been violated by a state party. The Protocol entered into force on 5 May 2013.\n\nNetworking groups such as ESCR-Net are working to create online resources and spread information about effective cases, initiatives, and working groups promoting ideals and celebrating victories of human rights initiatives and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Currently, human rights advocacy groups are working diligently to fine-tune rules, regulations and implementation schemes; little news of complaint successes or failures is available. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE) has helped to establish the Housing and Property Directorate (HPD/HPCC) in Kosovo.\n\nAccording to Karel Vasak's theory of three generations of human rights, economic, social and cultural rights are considered second-generation rights, while civil and political rights, such as freedom of speech, right to a fair trial, and the right to vote, are considered first-generation rights. The theory of negative and positive rights considers economic, social and cultural rights positive rights.\n\n"}

An expectation, which is a belief that is centered on the future, may or may not be realistic. A less advantageous result gives rise to the emotion of disappointment. If something happens that is not at all expected, it is a surprise. An expectation about the behavior or performance of another person, expressed to that person, may have the nature of a strong request, or an order; this kind of expectation is called a social norm. The degree to which something is expected to be true can be expressed using fuzzy logic.\n\nRichard Lazarus asserts that people become accustomed to positive or negative life experiences which lead to favorable or unfavorable expectations of their present and near-future circumstances. Lazarus notes the widely accepted philosophical principle that \"happiness depends on the background psychological status of the person...and cannot be well predicted without reference to one's expectations.\"\n\nWith regard to happiness or unhappiness, Lazarus notes that objective conditions of life are those of hardship and deprivation often make a positive assessment of their well-being,\" while \"people who are objectively well off...often make a negative assessment of their well-being.\" Lazarus argues that \"the most sensible explanation of this apparent paradox is that people...develop favorable or unfavorable \"expectations\"\" that guide such assessments.\n\nSociologist Robert K. Merton wrote that a person's expectation is directly linked to self-fulfilling prophecy. Whether or not such an expectation is truthful or not, has little or no effect on the outcome. If a person believes what they are told or convinces himself/herself of the fact, chances are this person will see the expectation to its inevitable conclusion. There is an inherent danger in this kind of labeling especially for the educator. Since children are easily convinced of certain tenets especially when told to them by an authority figure like a parent or teacher, they may believe whatever is taught to them even if what is taught has no factual basis. If the student or child were to act on false information, certain positive or negative unintended consequences could result. If overly positive or elevated expectations were used to describe or manipulate a person's self-image and execution falls short, the results could be a total reversal of that person's self-confidence. If thought of in terms of causality or cause and effect, the higher a person's expectation and the lower the execution, the higher the frustration level may become. This in turn could cause a total cessation of effort and motivate the person to quit.\n\nExpectations are a central part of value calculations in economics. For example, calculating the Subjective expected utility of an outcome requires knowing the both the value of an outcome and the probability that it will occur. Researchers who elicit (or measure) the expectations of individuals can input these beliefs into the model in place of standard probabilities. The strategy of eliciting individual expectations is now incorporated into many international surveys, including the Health and Retirement Study in the United States.\n\nExpectations elicitation is used in many domains, including survival and educational outcomes, but may be most prominent in financial realms. Expectations are theoretically important for models such as the Efficient-market hypothesis which suggest that all information should be incorporated into the market, as well as for Modern portfolio theory which suggests that investors must be compensated for higher levels of risk through higher (expected) returns. Following these models, empirical research has found that consumers with more optimistic stock market expectations are more likely to hold riskier assets, and acquire stocks in the near future. Given these promising findings, more recent research in psychology has begun to explore what factors drive consumers' expectations by exploring what factors come to mind when forming stock market expectations.\n"}

{"id": "176760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176760", "title": "Foot binding", "text": "Foot binding\n\nFoot binding was the custom of applying tight binding to the feet of young girls to modify the shape and size of their feet. It was practised in China from the Song dynasty until the early 20th century, and bound feet were considered a status symbol as well as a mark of beauty. Foot binding limited the mobility of women, and resulted in lifelong disabilities for most of its subjects, although some women with bound feet working outdoors have also been reported. Feet altered by binding were called lotus feet.\n\nThe practice possibly originated among upper class court dancers during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in 10th century China, then became popular among the elite during the Song dynasty, eventually spreading to all social classes by the Qing dynasty. Foot binding was practiced in different forms, and the more severe form of binding may have been developed in the 16th century. It has been estimated that by the 19th century, 40–50% of all Chinese women may have had bound feet, and up to almost 100% among upper class Chinese women. The prevalence and practice of foot binding however varied in different parts of the country.\n\nThere had been attempts to end the practice during the Qing dynasty; Manchu Kangxi Emperor tried to ban foot binding in 1664 but failed. In the later part of the 19th century, Chinese reformers challenged the practice but it was not until the early 20th century that foot binding began to die out as a result of anti-foot-binding campaigns. Only a few elderly Chinese women still survive today with bound feet.\n\nThere are a number of stories about the origin of foot binding before its establishment during the Song dynasty. One of these involves the story of a favorite consort of the Southern Qi emperor Xiao Baojuan, Pan Yunu (died 501 AD), who had delicate feet and danced barefoot on a floor decorated with golden lotus flower design. The emperor expressed admiration and said that \"lotus springs from her every step!\" (步步生蓮), a reference to the Buddhist legend of Padmavati under whose feet lotus springs forth. This story may have given rise to the terms \"golden lotus\" or \"lotus feet\" used to describe bound feet; there is, however, no evidence that Consort Pan ever bound her feet.\n\nThe general view is that the practice is likely to have originated from the time of the 10th-century Emperor Li Yu of the Southern Tang, just before the Song dynasty. Li Yu created a six-foot tall golden lotus decorated with precious stones and pearls, and asked his concubine to bind her feet in white silk into the shape of the crescent moon, and perform a ballet-like dance on the points of her feet on the lotus. Yao Niang's dance was said to be so graceful that others sought to imitate her. The binding of feet was then replicated by other upper-class women and the practice spread.\n\nSome of the earliest possible references to foot binding appear around 1100, when a couple of poems seemed to allude to the practice. Soon after 1148, in the earliest extant discourse on the practice of foot binding, scholar wrote that a bound foot should be arch-shape and small. He observed that \"women's footbinding began in recent times; it was not mentioned in any books from previous eras.\" In the 13th century, scholar wrote the first known criticism of the practice: \"Little girls not yet four or five years old, who have done nothing wrong, nevertheless are made to suffer unlimited pain to bind [their feet] small. I do not know what use this is.\"\n\nThe earliest archaeological evidence for foot binding dates to the tombs of Huang Sheng, who died in 1243 at the age of 17, and Madame Zhou, who died in 1274. Each had her feet bound with 6-foot-long gauze strips. Zhou's skeleton was well preserved and showed that her feet fit the narrow, pointed slippers that were buried with her. The style of bound feet found in Song dynasty tombs, where the big toe was bent upwards, appears to be different from the norm of later eras, and the excessive smallness of the feet, the \"three-inch golden lotus\", may be a later development in the 16th century.\n\nAt the end of the Song dynasty, men would drink from a special shoe whose heel contained a small cup. During the Yuan dynasty, some would also drink directly from the shoe itself. This practice was called \"toast to the golden lotus\" and lasted until the late Qing dynasty.\n\nThe first European to mention footbinding was the Italian missionary Odoric of Pordenone in the fourteenth century during the Yuan dynasty. However, no other foreign visitors to Yuan China mentioned the practice, including Ibn Battuta and Marco Polo (who nevertheless noted the dainty walk of Chinese women who took very small steps), perhaps an indication that it was not a widespread or extreme practice at that time. The practice however was encouraged by the Mongol rulers on their Chinese subjects. The practice became increasingly common among the gentry families, later spreading to the general population, as commoners and theatre actors alike adopted footbinding. By the Ming period, the practice was no longer the preserve of the gentry, but it was considered a status symbol. As foot binding restricted female movement, one side effect of its rising popularity was the corresponding decline of the art of dance in China in women, and it became increasingly rare to hear about beauties and courtesans who were also great dancers after the Song era.\n\nThe Manchus issued a number of edicts to ban the practice, first in 1636 when the Manchu leader Hong Taiji declared the founding of the new Qing dynasty, then in 1638, and another in 1664 by the Kangxi Emperor. However, few Han Chinese complied with the edicts and Kangxi eventually abandoned the effort in 1668. \nBy the 19th century, it was estimated that 40-50% of Chinese women had bound feet, and among upper class Han Chinese women, the figure was almost 100%. Bound feet became a mark of beauty and was also a prerequisite for finding a husband. It also became an avenue for poorer women to marry into money in some areas; for example, in late 19th century Guangdong, it was customary to bind the feet of the eldest daughter of a lower-class family who was intended to be brought up as a lady. Her younger sisters would grow up to be bond-servants or domestic slaves and be able to work in the fields, but the eldest daughter would assume to never have the need to work. Women, their families, and their husbands took great pride in tiny feet, with the ideal length, called the \"Golden Lotus\", being about three Chinese inches long (around in Western measurement). This pride was reflected in the elegantly embroidered silk slippers and wrappings girls and women wore to cover their feet. Walking on bound feet necessitated bending the knees slightly and swaying to maintain proper movement and balance, a dainty walk that was also considered erotic to some men.\n\nSome women with bound feet may not walk without the support of their shoes and were severely limited in their mobility. However, many women with bound feet were still able to walk and work in the fields, albeit with greater limitation than their non-bound counterparts. In the 19th and early 20th century, dancers with bound feet were popular, as were circus performers who stood on prancing or running horses. Women with bound feet in one village in Yunnan Province even formed a regional dance troupe to perform for tourists in the late 20th century, though age has since forced the group to retire. In other areas, women in their 70s and 80s could be found providing limited assistance to the workers in the rice fields well into the 21st century.\n\nOpposition to foot binding had been raised by some Chinese writers in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century, many of the rebel leaders of the Taiping Rebellion were of Hakka background whose womenfolk did not bind their feet, and foot binding was outlawed. The rebellion however failed, and Christian missionaries, who had provided education for girls and actively discouraged what they considered a barbaric practice, then played a part in changing elite opinion on footbinding through education, pamphleteering, and lobbying of the Qing court. The earliest-known Western anti-foot binding society, \"Jie Chan Zu Hui\" (截纏足会), was formed in 1874. In 1875, 60-70 Christian women in Xiamen attended a meeting presided over by a missionary John MacGowan formed the Natural Foot (\"tianzu\", literally Heavenly Foot) Society. It was then championed by the Woman's Christian Temperance Movement founded in 1883 and advocated by missionaries including Timothy Richard, who thought that Christianity could promote equality between the sexes.\n\nReform-minded Chinese intellectuals began to consider footbinding to be an aspect of their culture that needed to be eliminated. In the 1883, Kang Youwei founded the Anti-Footbinding Society near Canton to combat the practice, and anti-footbinding societies sprang up across the country, with membership for the movement claimed to reach 300,000. The anti-footbinding movement however stressed pragmatic and patriotic reasons rather than feminist ones, arguing that abolition of footbinding would lead to better health and more efficient labour. Reformers such as Liang Qichao, influenced by Social Darwinism, also argued that it weakened the nation, since enfeebled women supposedly produced weak sons. At the turn of the 20th century, early feminists, such as Qiu Jin, called for the end of foot-binding. Many members of anti-footbinding groups pledged to not bind their daughters' feet nor to allow their sons to marry women with bound feet. In 1902, the Empress Dowager Cixi issued an anti-foot binding edict, but it was soon rescinded.\n\nIn 1912, the new Republic of China government banned foot binding (though not actively implemented), and leading intellectuals of the May Fourth Movement saw footbinding as a major symbol of China's backwardness. Local warlords such as Yan Xishan in Shanxi engaged in their own sustained campaign against footbinding with feet inspectors and fines for those who continued with the practice, while regional governments of the later Nanjing regime also enforced the ban. The campaign against footbinding was very successful in some regions; in one province, a 1929 survey showed that whereas only 2.3% of girls born before 1910 had unbound feet, 95% of those born after were not bound. In a region south of Beijing, Dingxian, where over 99% of women were once bound, no new cases were found among those born after 1919. In Taiwan, the practice was also discouraged by the ruling Japanese from the beginning of Japanese rule, and from 1911 to 1915 it was gradually made illegal. The practice however lingered on in some regions in China; in 1928, a census in rural Shanxi found that 18% of women had bound feet, while in some remote rural areas such as Yunnan Province it continued to be practiced until the 1950s. In most parts of China, however, the practice had virtually disappeared by 1949. The practice was also stigmatized in Communist China, and the last vestiges of footbinding were stamped out, with the last new case of footbinding reported in 1957. By the 21st century, only a few elderly women in China still have bound feet. In 1999, the last shoe factory making lotus shoes, the Zhiqiang Shoe Factory in Harbin, closed.\n\nFoot binding was practiced in various forms and its prevalence varied in different regions. A less severe form in Sichuan, called \"cucumber foot\" (\"huanggua jiao\") due to its slender shape, folded the four toes under but did not distort the heel and taper the ankle. Some working women in Jiangsu made a pretense of binding while keeping their feet natural. Not all women were always bound—some women once bound remained bound all through their lives, but some were only briefly bound, and some were bound only until their marriage. Footbinding was most common among women whose work involved domestic crafts and those in urban areas; it was also more common in northern China where it was widely practiced by women of all social classes, but less so in parts of southern China such as Guangdong and Guangxi where it was largely a practice of women in the provincial capitals or among the gentry.\nManchu women, as well as Mongol and Chinese women in the Eight Banners, did not bind their feet, and the most a Manchu woman might do was to wrap the feet tightly to give them a slender appearance. The Manchus, wanting to emulate the particular gait that bound feet necessitated, adapted their own form of platform shoes to cause them to walk in a similar swaying manner. These \"flower bowl\" (花盆鞋) or \"horse-hoof\" shoes (馬蹄鞋) have a platform generally made of wood two to six inches in height and fitted to the middle of the sole, or they have a small central tapered pedestal. Many Han Chinese in the Inner City of Beijing also did not bind their feet, and it was reported in the mid-1800s that around 50-60% of non-banner women had unbound feet. Bound feet nevertheless became a significant differentiating marker between Han women and Manchu or other banner women.\n\nThe Hakka people however were unusual among Han Chinese in not practicing foot binding at all. Most non-Han Chinese people, such as the Manchus, Mongols and Tibetans, did not bind their feet; however, some non-Han ethnic groups did. Foot binding was practiced by the Hui Muslims in Gansu Province, the Dungan Muslims, descendants of Hui from northwestern China who fled to central Asia, were also seen practicing foot binding up to 1948. In southern China, in Guangzhou, 19th century Scottish scholar James Legge noted a mosque that had a placard denouncing foot binding, saying Islam did not allow it since it constituted violating the creation of God.\n\nThe process was started before the arch of the foot had a chance to develop fully, usually between the ages of 4 and 9. Binding usually started during the winter months since the feet were more likely to be numb, and therefore the pain would not be as extreme.\n\nFirst, each foot would be soaked in a warm mixture of herbs and animal blood; this was intended to soften the foot and aid the binding. Then, the toenails were cut back as far as possible to prevent in-growth and subsequent infections, since the toes were to be pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. Cotton bandages, 3 m long and 5 cm wide (10 ft by 2 in), were prepared by soaking them in the blood and herb mixture. To enable the size of the feet to be reduced, the toes on each foot were curled under, then pressed with great force downwards and squeezed into the sole of the foot until the toes broke.\n\nThe broken toes were held tightly against the sole of the foot while the foot was then drawn down straight with the leg and the arch of the foot was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.\n\nThe girl's broken feet required a great deal of care and attention, and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the feet were unbound, they were washed, the toes carefully checked for injury, and the nails carefully and meticulously trimmed. When unbound, the broken feet were also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl's feet were often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The feet were also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off.\n\nImmediately after this procedure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The bindings were pulled even tighter each time the girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated as often as possible (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants two or three times a week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.\n\nFor most the bound feet eventually became numb. However, once a foot had been crushed and bound, attempting to reverse the process by unbinding was painful, and the shape could not be reversed without a woman undergoing the same pain all over again.\n\nThe most common problem with bound feet was infection. Despite the amount of care taken in regularly trimming the toenails, they would often in-grow, becoming infected and causing injuries to the toes. Sometimes, for this reason, the girl's toenails would be peeled back and removed altogether. The tightness of the binding meant that the circulation in the feet was faulty, and the circulation to the toes was almost cut off, so any injuries to the toes were unlikely to heal and were likely to gradually worsen and lead to infected toes and rotting flesh. The necrosis of the flesh would also initially give off a foul odor, and later the smell may come from various microorganisms that colonized the folds.\n\nIf the infection in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; however, this was seen as a benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.\n\nAt the beginning of the binding, many of the foot bones would remain broken, often for years. However, as the girl grew older, the bones would begin to heal. Even after the foot bones had healed, they were prone to re-breaking repeatedly, especially when the girl was in her teenage years and her feet were still soft. Bones in the girls' feet would often be deliberately broken again in order to further change the size or shape of the feet. This was especially the case with the toes, as small toes were especially desirable. Older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls, since they could not balance securely on their feet, and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position. Other issues that might arise from foot binding included paralysis and muscular atrophy.\n\nBefore footbinding was practiced in China, admiration for small feet already existed as demonstrated by the Tang dynasty tale of Ye Xian written around 850 by Duan Chengshi. This tale of a girl who lost her shoe and then married a king who sought the owner of the shoe as only her foot was small enough to fit the shoe contains elements of the European story of Cinderella, and is thought to be one of its antecedents. For many, the bound feet were an enhancement to a woman's beauty and made her movement more dainty, and a woman with perfect lotus feet was likely to make a more prestigious marriage. The desirability varies with the size of the feet – the perfect bound feet and the most desirable (called \"golden lotuses\") would be around 3 Chinese inches (around 4 inches (10 cm) in Western measurement) or smaller, while those larger may be called \"silver lotuses\" (4 Chinese inches) or \"iron lotuses\" (5 Chinese inches or larger and the least desirable for marriage). The belief that footbinding made women more desirable to men is widely used as an explanation for the spread and persistence of footbinding.\n\nSome also considered bound feet to be intensely erotic, and Qing Dynasty sex manuals listed 48 different ways of playing with women's bound feet. Some men preferred never to see a woman's bound feet, so they were always concealed within tiny \"lotus shoes\" and wrappings. According to Robert van Gulik, the bound feet were also considered the most intimate part of a woman's body; in erotic art of the Qing to Song periods where the genitalia may be shown, the bound feet were never depicted uncovered. Howard Levy however suggests that the barely revealed bound foot may also only function as an initial tease.\n\nAn erotic effect of the bound feet was the lotus gait, the tiny steps and swaying walk of a woman whose feet had been bound. Women with such deformed feet avoided placing weight on the front of the foot and tended to walk predominantly on their heels. As a result, women who had undergone foot-binding would walk in a cautious and unsteady manner. Some men found the smell of the bound feet attractive, and some also apparently believed that bound feet would cause layers of folds to develop in the vagina, and that the thighs would become sensuously heavier and the vagina tighter. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud considered footbinding to be a \"perversion that corresponds to foot fetishism\".\n\nA common argument is that the revival of Confucianism as Neo-Confucianism during the Song dynasty resulted in the decline of the status of women, and that in addition to promoting the seclusion of women and the cult of widow chastity, it also contributed to the development of footbinding. According to Robert van Gulik, the prominent Song Confucian scholar Zhu Xi stressed the inferiority of women as well as the need to keep men and women strictly separate. It was claimed by Lin Yutang among others, probably based on an oral tradition, that Zhu Xi also promoted footbinding in Fujian as a way of encouraging chastity among women, that by restricting their movement it would help keep men and women separate. However, historian Patricia Ebrey suggests that this story might be fictitious.\n\nSome Confucian moralists in fact disapproved of the erotic associations of footbinding, and unbound women were also praised. The Neo-Confucian Cheng Yi was said to be against footbinding and his family and descendants did not bind their feet. Modern Confucian scholars such as Tu Weiming also dispute any causal link between neo-Confucianism and footbinding. It has been noted that Confucian doctrine in fact prohibits mutilation of the body as people should not \"injure even the hair and skin of the body received from mother and father\". It is however argued that such injunction applies less to women, rather it is meant to emphasize the sacred link between sons and their parents. Furthermore, it is argued that Confucianism institutionalized the family system in which women are called upon to sacrifice themselves for the good of the family, a system that fostered such practice. Confucian instructions on the moral behaviour of women would include examples of women who were prepared to die or suffer mutilation to show their commitment to the Confucian ethos.\n\nHistorian Dorothy Ko proposed that footbinding may be an expression of the Confucian ideals of civility and culture in the form of correct attire or bodily adornment, and that footbinding was seen as a necessary part of being feminine as well as being civilized. Footbinding was often classified in Chinese encyclopedia as clothing or a form of bodily embellishment rather than mutilation; one from 1591 for example placed footbinding in a section on \"Female Adornments\" that included hairdos, powders, and ear-piercings. According to Ko, the perception of footbinding as a civilised practice may be evinced from a Ming dynasty account that mentioned a proposal to \"entice [the barbarians] to civilize their customs\" by encouraging footbinding among their womenfolk. The practice was also carried out only by women on girls, and it served to emphasize the distinction between male and female, an emphasis that began from an early age. Anthropologist Fred Blake argued that the practice of footbinding was a form of discipline undertaken by women themselves, and perpetuated by women on their daughters, so as to inform their daughters of their role and position in society, and to support and participate in the neo-Confucian way of being civilized.\n\nFoot binding is often seen by feminists as an oppressive practice against women who were victims of a sexist culture. It is also widely seen as a form of violence against women. Bound feet rendered women dependent on their families, particularly their men, as they became largely restricted to their homes. The early Chinese feminist Qiu Jin, who underwent the painful process of unbinding her own bound feet, attacked footbinding and other traditional practices. She argued that women, by retaining their small bound feet, made themselves subservient as it would mean women imprisoning themselves indoors. She believed that women should emancipate themselves from oppression, that girls can ensure their independence through education, and that they should develop new mental and physical qualities fitting for the new era. The ending of the practice is seen as a significant event in the process of female emancipation in China.\n\nSome scholars such as Laurel Bossen and Hill Gates reject the theories that bound feet in China were considered more beautiful, or that it was a means of male control over women, a sign of class status, or a chance for women to marry well. They argued that foot binding was important in work, and can be seen as a way by mothers to tie their daughters down, train them in handwork and keep them close at hand.\n\nIt has also been argued that while the practice started out as a fashion, it persisted because it became an expression of Han identity after the Mongols invaded China in 1279, and later the Manchus' conquest in 1644, as it was then practiced only by Han women. During the Qing Dynasty, attempts were made by the Manchus to ban the practice but failed, and it has been argued the attempts at banning may have in fact led to a spread of the practice among Han Chinese in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe bound foot has played a prominent part in many media works, both Chinese and non-Chinese, modern and traditional. These depictions are sometimes based on observation or research and sometimes on rumors or supposition. Sometimes, as in the case of Pearl Buck's \"The Good Earth\" (1931), the accounts are relatively neutral, implying a respect for Chinese culture and assuming that it is not the role of outsiders to promote reform. Sometimes the accounts seem intended to rouse like-minded Chinese and foreign opinion to abolish the custom, and sometimes the accounts imply condescension or contempt for China.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is measured in units of formula_18 and is denoted by formula_19 (or formula_20). It may be inductive formula_21 or capacitive formula_22, where formula_9 is the angular frequency of a magnetic current, formula_24 is the magnetic inductivity of a circuit, formula_25 is the magnetic capacitivity of a circuit. The magnetic reactance of an undeveloped circuit with the inductivity and the capacitivity, which are connected in series, is equal: formula_26 .

HP can be stated formally in systems of second-order logic. Hume's principle is named for the Scottish philosopher David Hume.\n\nHP plays a central role in Gottlob Frege's philosophy of mathematics. Frege shows that HP and suitable definitions of arithmetical notions entail all axioms of what we now call second-order arithmetic. This result is known as Frege's theorem, which is the foundation for a philosophy of mathematics known as neo-logicism.\n\nHume's principle appears in Frege's \"Foundations of Arithmetic\" (§73), which quotes from Part III of Book I of David Hume's \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" (1740). Hume there sets out seven fundamental relations between ideas. Concerning one of these, proportion in quantity or number, Hume argues that our reasoning about proportion in quantity, as represented by geometry, can never achieve \"perfect precision and exactness\", since its principles are derived from sense-appearance. He contrasts this with reasoning about number or arithmetic, in which such a precision \"can\" be attained:\n\nAlgebra and arithmetic [are] the only sciences in which we can carry on a chain of reasoning to any degree of intricacy, and yet preserve a perfect exactness and certainty. We are possessed of a precise standard, by which we can judge of the equality and proportion of numbers; and according as they correspond or not to that standard, we determine their relations, without any possibility of error. \"When two numbers are so combined, as that the one has always a unit answering to every unit of the other, we pronounce them equal\"; and it is for want of such a standard of equality in [spatial] extension, that geometry can scarce be esteemed a perfect and infallible science. (I. III. I.)\n\nNote Hume's use of the word \"number\" in the ancient sense, to mean a set or collection of things rather than the common modern notion of \"positive integer\". The ancient Greek notion of number (\"arithmos\") is of a finite plurality composed of units. See Aristotle, \"Metaphysics\", 1020a14 and Euclid, \"Elements\", Book VII, Definition 1 and 2. The contrast between the old and modern conception of number is discussed in detail in Mayberry (2000).\n\nThe principle that cardinal number was to be characterized in terms of one-to-one correspondence had previously been used to great effect by Georg Cantor, whose writings Frege knew. The suggestion has therefore been made that Hume's principle ought better be called \"Cantor's Principle\". But Frege criticized Cantor on the ground that Cantor defines cardinal numbers in terms of ordinal numbers, whereas Frege wanted to give a characterization of cardinals that was independent of the ordinals. Cantor's point of view, however, is the one embedded in contemporary theories of transfinite numbers, as developed in axiomatic set theory.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14225", "title": "Hydrogen atom", "text": "Hydrogen atom\n\nA hydrogen atom is an atom of the chemical element hydrogen. The electrically neutral atom contains a single positively charged proton and a single negatively charged electron bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force. Atomic hydrogen constitutes about 75% of the baryonic mass of the universe.\n\nIn everyday life on Earth, isolated hydrogen atoms (called \"atomic hydrogen\") are extremely rare. Instead, hydrogen tends to combine with other atoms in compounds, or with itself to form ordinary (diatomic) hydrogen gas, H. \"Atomic hydrogen\" and \"hydrogen atom\" in ordinary English use have overlapping, yet distinct, meanings. For example, a water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms, but does not contain atomic hydrogen (which would refer to isolated hydrogen atoms).\n\nAtomic spectroscopy shows that there is a discrete infinite set of states in which a hydrogen (or any) atom can exist, contrary to the predictions of classical physics. Attempts to develop a theoretical understanding of the states of the hydrogen atom have been important to the history of quantum mechanics, since all other atoms can be roughly understood by knowing in detail about this simplest atomic structure.\n\nThe most abundant isotope, hydrogen-1, protium, or light hydrogen, contains no neutrons and is simply a proton and an electron. Protium is stable and makes up 99.985% of naturally occurring hydrogen atoms.\n\nDeuterium contains one neutron and one proton. Deuterium is stable and makes up 0.0156% of naturally occurring hydrogen and is used in industrial processes like nuclear reactors and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.\n\nTritium contains two neutrons and one proton and is not stable, decaying with a half-life of 12.32 years. Because of the short half life, tritium does not exist in nature except in trace amounts.\n\nHigher isotopes of hydrogen are only created in artificial accelerators and reactors and have half lives around the order of 10 seconds.\n\nThe formulas below are valid for all three isotopes of hydrogen, but slightly different values of the Rydberg constant (correction formula given below) must be used for each hydrogen isotope.\n\nHydrogen is not found without its electron in ordinary chemistry (room temperatures and pressures), as ionized hydrogen is highly chemically reactive. When ionized hydrogen is written as \"H\" as in the solvation of classical acids such as hydrochloric acid, the hydronium ion, HO, is meant, not a literal ionized single hydrogen atom. In that case, the acid transfers the proton to HO to form HO.\n\nIonized hydrogen without its electron, or free protons, are common in the interstellar medium, and solar wind.\n\nThe hydrogen atom has special significance in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory as a simple two-body problem physical system which has yielded many simple analytical solutions in closed-form.\n\nExperiments by Ernest Rutherford in 1909 showed the structure of the atom to be a dense, positive nucleus with a light, negative charge orbiting around it. This immediately caused problems on how such a system could be stable. Classical electromagnetism had shown that any accelerating charge radiates energy described through the Larmor formula. If the electron is assumed to orbit in a perfect circle and radiates energy continuously, the electron would rapidly spiral into the nucleus with a fall time of:\n\nWhere formula_2 is the Bohr radius and formula_3 is the classical electron radius. If this were true, all atoms would instantly collapse, however atoms seem to be stable. Furthermore, the spiral inward would release a smear of electromagnetic frequencies as the orbit got smaller. Instead, atoms were observed to only emit discrete frequencies of radiation. The resolution would lie in the development of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr obtained the energy levels and spectral frequencies of the hydrogen atom after making a number of simple assumptions in order to correct the failed classical model. The assumptions included:\nBohr supposed that the electron's angular momentum is quantized with possible values:\n\nformula_4 where formula_5\n\nand formula_6 is Planck constant over formula_7. He also supposed that the centripetal force which keeps the electron in its orbit is provided by the Coulomb force, and that energy is conserved. Bohr derived the energy of each orbit of the hydrogen atom to be:\n\nwhere formula_9 is the electron mass, formula_10 is the electron charge, formula_11 is the vacuum permittivity, and formula_12 is the quantum number (now known as the principal quantum number). Bohr's predictions matched experiments measuring the hydrogen spectral series to the first order, giving more confidence to a theory that used quantized values.\n\nFor formula_13, the value\nis called the Rydberg unit of energy. It is related to the Rydberg constant formula_15 of atomic physics by formula_16\n\nThe exact value of the Rydberg constant assumes that the nucleus is infinitely massive with respect to the electron. For hydrogen-1, hydrogen-2 (deuterium), and hydrogen-3 (tritium) the constant must be slightly modified to use the reduced mass of the system, rather than simply the mass of the electron. However, since the nucleus is much heavier than the electron, the values are nearly the same. The Rydberg constant \"R\" for a hydrogen atom (one electron), \"R\" is given by\n\nformula_17\n\nwhere formula_18 is the mass of the atomic nucleus. For hydrogen-1, the quantity formula_19 is about 1/1836 (i.e. the electron-to-proton mass ratio). For deuterium and tritium, the ratios are about 1/3670 and 1/5497 respectively. These figures, when added to 1 in the denominator, represent very small corrections in the value of \"R\", and thus only small corrections to all energy levels in corresponding hydrogen isotopes.\n\nThere were still problems with Bohr's model: \n\nMost of these shortcomings were repaired by Arnold Sommerfeld's modification of the Bohr model. Sommerfeld introduced two additional degrees of freedom allowing an electron to move on an elliptical orbit, characterized by its eccentricity and declination with respect to a chosen axis. This introduces two additional quantum numbers, which correspond to the orbital angular momentum and its projection on the chosen axis. Thus the correct multiplicity of states (except for the factor 2 accounting for the yet unknown electron spin) was found. Further applying special relativity theory to the elliptic orbits, Sommerfeld succeeded in deriving the correct expression for the fine structure of hydrogen spectra (which happens to be exactly the same as in the most elaborate Dirac theory). However some observed phenomena such as the anomalous Zeeman effect remain unexplained. These issues were resolved with the full development of quantum mechanics and the Dirac equation. It is often alleged, that the Schrödinger equation is superior to the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory in describing hydrogen atom. This is however not the case, as the most results of both approaches coincide or are very close (a remarkable exception is the problem of hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields, which cannot be solved in the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory self-consistently), and their main shortcomings result from the absence of the electron spin in both theories. It was the complete failure of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory to explain many-electron systems (such as helium atom or hydrogen molecule) which demonstrated its inadequacy in describing quantum phenomena.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation allows one to calculate the development of quantum systems with time and can give exact, analytical answers for the non-relativistic hydrogen atom.\n\nThe Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom is the radial kinetic energy operator and coulomb attraction force between the positive proton and negative electron. Using the time-independent Schrödinger equation, ignoring all spin-coupling interactions and using the reduced mass formula_22, the equation is written as:\n\nformula_23\n\nExpanding the Laplacian in spherical coordinates:\n\nformula_24\n\nThis is a separable, partial differential equation which can be solved in terms of special functions. The normalized position wavefunctions, given in spherical coordinates are:\n\nwhere:\n\nThe quantum numbers can take the following values: \n\nAdditionally, these wavefunctions are \"normalized\" (i.e., the integral of their modulus square equals 1) and orthogonal:\nwhere formula_37 is the state represented by the wavefunction formula_38 in Dirac notation, and formula_39 is the Kronecker delta function.\n\nThe wavefunctions in momentum space are related to the wavefunctions in position space through a Fourier transform\n\nwhich, for the bound states, results in \n\nwhere formula_42 denotes a Gegenbauer polynomial and formula_43 is in units of formula_44.\n\nThe solutions to the Schrödinger equation for hydrogen are analytical, giving a simple expression for the hydrogen energy levels and thus the frequencies of the hydrogen spectral lines and fully reproduced the Bohr model and went beyond it. It also yields two other quantum numbers and the shape of the electron's wave function (\"orbital\") for the various possible quantum-mechanical states, thus explaining the anisotropic character of atomic bonds.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation also applies to more complicated atoms and molecules. When there is more than one electron or nucleus the solution is not analytical and either computer calculations are necessary or simplifying assumptions must be made.\n\nSince the Schrödinger equation is only valid for non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the solutions it yields for the hydrogen atom are not entirely correct. The Dirac equation of relativistic quantum theory improves these solutions (see below).\n\nThe solution of the Schrödinger equation (wave equation) for the hydrogen atom uses the fact that the Coulomb potential produced by the nucleus is isotropic (it is radially symmetric in space and only depends on the distance to the nucleus). Although the resulting energy eigenfunctions (the \"orbitals\") are not necessarily isotropic themselves, their dependence on the angular coordinates follows completely generally from this isotropy of the underlying potential: the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (that is, the energy eigenstates) can be chosen as simultaneous eigenstates of the angular momentum operator. This corresponds to the fact that angular momentum is conserved in the orbital motion of the electron around the nucleus. Therefore, the energy eigenstates may be classified by two angular momentum quantum numbers, \"ℓ\" and \"m\" (both are integers). The angular momentum quantum number determines the magnitude of the angular momentum. The magnetic quantum number determines the projection of the angular momentum on the (arbitrarily chosen) \"z\"-axis.\n\nIn addition to mathematical expressions for total angular momentum and angular momentum projection of wavefunctions, an expression for the radial dependence of the wave functions must be found. It is only here that the details of the 1/\"r\" Coulomb potential enter (leading to Laguerre polynomials in \"r\"). This leads to a third quantum number, the principal quantum number . The principal quantum number in hydrogen is related to the atom's total energy.\n\nNote that the maximum value of the angular momentum quantum number is limited by the principal quantum number: it can run only up to \"n\" − 1, i.e. .\n\nDue to angular momentum conservation, states of the same \"ℓ\" but different \"m\" have the same energy (this holds for all problems with rotational symmetry). In addition, for the hydrogen atom, states of the same \"n\" but different \"ℓ\" are also degenerate (i.e. they have the same energy). However, this is a specific property of hydrogen and is no longer true for more complicated atoms which have an (effective) potential differing from the form 1/\"r\" (due to the presence of the inner electrons shielding the nucleus potential).\n\nTaking into account the spin of the electron adds a last quantum number, the projection of the electron's spin angular momentum along the \"z\"-axis, which can take on two values. Therefore, any eigenstate of the electron in the hydrogen atom is described fully by four quantum numbers. According to the usual rules of quantum mechanics, the actual state of the electron may be any superposition of these states. This explains also why the choice of \"z\"-axis for the directional quantization of the angular momentum vector is immaterial: an orbital of given \"ℓ\" and \"m\"′ obtained for another preferred axis \"z\"′ can always be represented as a suitable superposition of the various states of different \"m\" (but same \"l\") that have been obtained for \"z\".\n\nIn 1928, Paul Dirac found an equation that was fully compatible with Special Relativity, and (as a consequence) made the wave function a 4-component \"Dirac spinor\" including \"up\" and \"down\" spin components, with both positive and \"negative\" energy (or matter and antimatter). The solution to this equation gave the following results, more accurate than the Schrödinger solution.\n\nThe energy levels of hydrogen, including fine structure (excluding Lamb shift and hyperfine structure), are given by the Sommerfeld fine structure expression:\n\nwhere \"α\" is the fine-structure constant and \"j\" is the \"total angular momentum\" quantum number, which is equal to |\"ℓ\" ± | depending on the direction of the electron spin. This formula represents a small correction to the energy obtained by Bohr and Schrödinger as given above. The factor in square brackets in the last expression is nearly one; the extra term arises from relativistic effects (for details, see #Features going beyond the Schrödinger solution). It is worth noting that this expression was first obtained by A. Sommerfeld in 1916 based on the relativistic version of the old Bohr theory. Sommerfeld has however used different notation for the quantum numbers.\n\nThe image to the right shows the first few hydrogen atom orbitals (energy eigenfunctions). These are cross-sections of the probability density that are color-coded (black represents zero density and white represents the highest density). The angular momentum (orbital) quantum number \"ℓ\" is denoted in each column, using the usual spectroscopic letter code (\"s\" means \"ℓ\" = 0, \"p\" means \"ℓ\" = 1, \"d\" means \"ℓ\" = 2). The main (principal) quantum number \"n\" (= 1, 2, 3, ...) is marked to the right of each row. For all pictures the magnetic quantum number \"m\" has been set to 0, and the cross-sectional plane is the \"xz\"-plane (\"z\" is the vertical axis). The probability density in three-dimensional space is obtained by rotating the one shown here around the \"z\"-axis.\n\nThe \"ground state\", i.e. the state of lowest energy, in which the electron is usually found, is the first one, the 1\"s\" state (principal quantum level \"n\" = 1, \"ℓ\" = 0).\n\nBlack lines occur in each but the first orbital: these are the nodes of the wavefunction, i.e. where the probability density is zero. (More precisely, the nodes are spherical harmonics that appear as a result of solving Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates.)\n\nThe quantum numbers determine the layout of these nodes. There are:\n\nThere are several important effects that are neglected by the Schrödinger equation and which are responsible for certain small but measurable deviations of the real spectral lines from the predicted ones:\n\n\nBoth of these features (and more) are incorporated in the relativistic Dirac equation, with predictions that come still closer to experiment. Again the Dirac equation may be solved analytically in the special case of a two-body system, such as the hydrogen atom. The resulting solution quantum states now must be classified by the total angular momentum number \"j\" (arising through the coupling between electron spin and orbital angular momentum). States of the same \"j\" and the same \"n\" are still degenerate. Thus, direct analytical solution of Dirac equation predicts 2S() and 2P() levels of Hydrogen to have exactly the same energy, which is in a contradiction with observations (Lamb-Retherford experiment).\n\n\nFor these developments, it was essential that the solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom could be worked out exactly, such that any experimentally observed deviation had to be taken seriously as a signal of failure of the theory.\n\nIn the language of Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, the hydrogen atom was first solved by Wolfgang Pauli using a rotational symmetry in four dimensions [O(4)-symmetry] generated by the angular momentum \nand the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector. By extending the symmetry group O(4) to the dynamical group O(4,2),\nthe entire spectrum and all transitions were embedded in a single irreducible group representation.\n\nIn 1979 the (non relativistic) hydrogen atom was solved for the first time within Feynman's path integral formulation\nof quantum mechanics. This work greatly extended the range of applicability of Feynman's method.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "75469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75469", "title": "Ideology", "text": "Ideology\n\nAn ideology is a collection of normative beliefs and values that an individual or group holds for other than purely epistemic reasons.\n\nThe term was coined by Antoine Destutt de Tracy in 1796, who conceived it as the \"science of ideas\". In contemporary philosophy it is narrower in scope than that original concept, or the ideas expressed in broad concepts such as \"worldview\", \"imaginary\" and \"ontology\".\n\nIn the political world, for instance, there are many well-known political ideologies, which cover a wide range of human interests.\n\nIn the sense defined by French Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, ideology is \"the imagined existence (or idea) of things as it relates to the real conditions of existence\".\n\nThe term \"ideology\" was born during the Reign of Terror of French Revolution, and acquired several other meanings thereafter.\n\nThe word, and the system of ideas associated with it, was coined by Antoine Destutt de Tracy in 1796, while he was in prison pending trial during the Terror. The word was created by assembling the words \"idea\", from Greek (near to the Lockean sense) and \"-logy\", from .\n\nThe coup that overthrew Maximilien Robespierre allowed Tracy to pursue his work.\n\nTracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob impulses that had nearly destroyed him. He devised the term for a \"science of ideas\" he hoped would form a secure foundation for the moral and political sciences. He based the word on two things: 1) sensations people experience as they interact with the material world; and 2) the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations. He conceived \"Ideology\" as a liberal philosophy that would defend individual liberty, property, free markets, and constitutional limits on state power. He argues that among these aspects ideology is the most generic term, because the science of ideas also contains the study of their expression and deduction.\n\nTracy worked this out during the Napoleonic regime, and Napoleon Bonaparte came to view 'Ideology' a term of abuse, which he often hurled against his liberal foes in Tracy's Institut National. According to Karl Mannheim's historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of ideology, the modern meaning of the word was born when Napoleon used it to describe his opponents as \"the ideologues\". Karl Marx adopted this negative sense of the term and used it in his writings (he described Tracy as a \"fischblütige Bourgeoisdoktrinär\", a fishblooded bourgeois doctrinaire).\n\nTracy's major book, \"The Elements of Ideology\", was soon translated into the major languages of Europe, and in the next generation, when post-Napoleonic governments adopted a reactionary stance, influenced the Italian, Spanish and Russian thinkers who had begun to describe themselves as \"liberals\" and who attempted to reignite revolutionary activity in the early 1820s (these included the Carlist rebels in Spain, the Carbonari societies in France and Italy, and the Decembrists in Russia).\n\nIn the century after Tracy, the term ideology moved back and forth between positive and negative connotations.\n\nThe term \"ideology\" has dropped some of its pejorative sting, and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups. While Karl Marx situated the term within class struggle and domination, others believed it was a necessary part of institutional functioning and social integration.\n\nThere has been considerable analysis of different ideological patterns. Some have described this kind of analysis as \"meta-ideology\"—the study of the structure, form, and manifestation of ideologies. Recent analysis tends to posit that ideology is a \"coherent system of ideas\" that rely on a few basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis. Ideas become ideologies (that is, become coherent, repeated patterns) through the subjective ongoing choices that people make, serving as the seed around which further thought grows. According to most recent analysis, ideologies are neither necessarily right nor wrong. Believers in ideology range from passive acceptance through fervent advocacy to true belief.\n\nThis accords with definitions, such as by Manfred Steger and Paul James, that emphasize both the issue of patterning and contingent claims to truth:\n\nThe works of George Walford and Harold Walsby, done under the heading of systematic ideology, are attempts to explore the relationships between ideology and social systems. Charles Blattberg offers an account that distinguishes political ideologies from political philosophies.\n\nDavid W. Minar describes six different ways the word \"ideology\" has been used:\n\nFor Willard A. Mullins an ideology should be contrasted with the related (but different) issues of \"utopia\" and \"historical myth\". An ideology is composed of four basic characteristics:\n\nTerry Eagleton outlines (more or less in no particular order) some definitions of ideology:\n\nThe German philosopher Christian Duncker called for a \"critical reflection of the ideology concept\" (2006). In his work, he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground, as well as the closely connected concerns of epistemology and history. In this work, the term ideology is defined in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly claim to absolute truth.\n\nThere are many different kinds of ideologies: political, social, epistemological, and ethical.\n\nIn the Marxist economic base and superstructure model of society, \"base\" denotes the relations of production and modes of production, and \"superstructure\" denotes the dominant ideology (religious, legal, political systems). The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology—actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a feudal mode of production, religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure, while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as liberalism and social democracy dominate. Hence the great importance of the ideology justifying a society; it politically confuses the alienated groups of society via false consciousness.\n\nSome explanations have been presented. György Lukács proposes ideology as a projection of the class consciousness of the ruling class. Antonio Gramsci uses cultural hegemony to explain why the working-class have a false ideological conception of what are their best interests. Marx argued that \"The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production.\"\n\nThe Marxist formulation of \"ideology as an instrument of social reproduction\" is conceptually important to the sociology of knowledge, viz. Karl Mannheim, Daniel Bell, and Jürgen Habermas et al. Moreover, Mannheim has developed, and progressed, from the \"total\" but \"special\" Marxist conception of ideology to a \"general\" and \"total\" ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology (including Marxism) resulted from social life, an idea developed by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. Slavoj Žižek and the earlier Frankfurt School added to the \"general theory\" of ideology a psychoanalytic insight that ideologies do not include only conscious, but also unconscious ideas.\n\nLouis Althusser proposed both spiritual and materialistic conception of ideology, which made use of a special type of discourse: the lacunar discourse. A number of propositions, which are never untrue, suggest a number of other propositions, which are. In this way, the essence of the lacunar discourse is what is \"not\" told (but is suggested).\n\nFor example, the statement \"All are equal before the law,\" which is a theoretical groundwork of current legal systems, suggests that all people may be of equal worth or have equal \"opportunities\". This is not true, for the concept of private property and power over the means of production results in some people being able to own more (\"much\" more) than others. This power disparity contradicts the claim that all share both practical worth and future opportunity equally; for example, the rich can afford better legal representation, which practically privileges them before the law.\n\nAlthusser also proffered the concept of the ideological state apparatus to explain his theory of ideology. His first thesis was \"\"ideology has no history\": while individual ideolog\"ies\" have histories, interleaved with the general class struggle of society, the general form of ideology is external to history.\n\nFor Althusser, beliefs and ideas are the products of social practices, not the reverse. His thesis that \"ideas are material\"\" is illustrated by the \"scandalous advice\" of Pascal toward unbelievers: \"Kneel and pray, and then you will believe.\" What is ultimately ideological for Althusser are not the subjective beliefs held in the conscious \"minds\" of human individuals, but rather discourses that produce these beliefs, the material institutions and rituals that individuals take part in without submitting it to conscious examination and so much more critical thinking.\n\nThe French Marxist theorist Guy Debord, founding member of the Situationist International, argued that when the commodity becomes the \"essential category\" of society, i.e. when the process of commodification has been consummated to its fullest extent, the image of society propagated by the commodity (as it describes all of life as constituted by notions and objects deriving their value only as commodities tradeable in terms of exchange value), colonizes all of life and reduces society to a mere representation, The Society of the Spectacle.\n\nThe German cultural historian Silvio Vietta described the development and expansion of Western rationality from ancient times onwards as often accompanied by and shaped by ideologies like that of the \"just war\", the \"true religion\", racism, nationalism, or the vision of future history as a kind of heaven on earth in communism. He said that ideas like these became ideologies by giving hegemonic political actions an idealistic veneer and equipping their leaders with a higher and, in the \"political religions\" (Eric Voegelin), nearly God-like power, so that they became masters over the lives (and the deaths) of millions of people. He considered that ideologies therefore contributed to power politics irrational shields of ideas beneath which they could operate as manifestations of idealism.\n\nThe American philosopher Eric Hoffer identified several elements that unify followers of a particular ideology:\n1) Hatred: \"Mass movements can rise and spread without a God, but never without belief in a devil.\". The \"ideal devil\" is a foreigner.\n\n2) Imitation: \"The less satisfaction we derive from being ourselves, the greater is our desire to be like others ... the more we mistrust our judgment and luck, the more are we ready to follow the example of others.\"\n\n3) Persuasion: The proselytizing zeal of propagandists derives from \"a passionate search for something not yet found more than a desire to bestow something we already have.\"\n\n4) Coercion: Hoffer asserts that violence and fanaticism are interdependent. People forcibly converted to Islamic or communist beliefs become as fanatical as those who did the forcing. \"It takes fanatical faith to rationalize our cowardice.\"\n\n5) Leadership: Without the leader, there is no movement. Often the leader must wait long in the wings until the time is ripe. He calls for sacrifices in the present, to justify his vision of a breathtaking future. The skills required include: audacity, brazenness, iron will, fanatical conviction; passionate hatred, cunning, a delight in symbols; ability to inspire blind faith in the masses and a group of able lieutenants. Charlatanism is indispensable, and the leader often imitates both friend and foe, \"a single-minded fashioning after a model.\" He will not lead followers towards the \"promised land,\" but only \"away from their unwanted selves.\"\n\n6) Action: Original thoughts are suppressed, and unity encouraged, if the masses are kept occupied through great projects, marches, exploration and industry.\n\n7) Suspicion: \"There is prying and spying, tense watching and a tense awareness of being watched.\" This pathological mistrust goes unchallenged and encourages conformity, not dissent.\n\nRonald Inglehart of the University of Michigan is author of the World Values Survey, which, since 1980, has mapped social attitudes in 100 countries representing 90% of global population. Results indicate that where people live is likely to closely correlate with their ideological beliefs. In much of Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, people prefer traditional beliefs and are less tolerant of liberal values. Protestant Europe, at the other extreme, adheres more to secular beliefs and liberal values. Alone among high-income countries, the United States is exceptional in its adherence to traditional beliefs, in this case Christianity.\n\nIn social studies, a political ideology is a certain ethical set of ideals, principles, doctrines, myths, or symbols of a social movement, institution, class, or large group that explains how society should work, and offers some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society, including (for example): the economy, education, health care, labor law, criminal law, the justice system, the provision of social security and social welfare, trade, the environment, minors, immigration, race, use of the military, patriotism, and established religion.\n\nPolitical ideologies have two dimensions:\n\nThere are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies, each of these different methods generate a specific political spectrum. Ideologies also identify themselves by their position on the political spectrum (such as the left, the center or the right), though precision in this respect can very often become controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from political strategies (e.g., populism) and from single issues that a party may be built around (e.g. legalization of marijuana). Philosopher Michael Oakeshott provides a good definition of ideology as \"the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub-stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition\".\n\nA political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate power and to what ends power should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. Each political ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers the best form of government (e.g., democracy, demagogy, theocracy, caliphate etc.), and the best economic system (e.g. capitalism, socialism, etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, \"socialism\" may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology that supports that economic system.\n\nStudies of the concept of ideology itself (rather than specific ideologies) have been carried out under the name of systematic ideology.\n\nPost 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age, in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed, and this view is often associated with Francis Fukuyama's writings on \"the end of history\". On the other hand, Nienhueser sees research (in the field of human resource management) as ongoingly \"generating ideology\".\n\nSlavoj Zizek has pointed out how the very notion of post-ideology can enable the deepest, blindest form of ideology. A sort of false consciousness or false cynicism, engaged in for the purpose of lending one's point of view the respect of being objective, pretending neutral cynicism, without truly being so. Rather than help avoiding ideology, this lapse only deepens the commitment to an existing one. Zizek calls this \"a post-modernist trap\". Peter Sloterdijk advanced the same idea already in 1988.\n\nThere are several studies that show that affinity to a specific political ideology is heritable.\n\nWhen a political ideology becomes a dominantly pervasive component within a government, one can speak of an ideocracy. Different forms of government utilize ideology in various ways, not always restricted to politics and society. Certain ideas and schools of thought become favored, or rejected, over others, depending on their compatibility with or use for the reigning social order.\n\n\"Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back\", said John Maynard Keynes. How do ideologies become part of government policy?\nIn \"The Anatomy of Revolution\", Crane Brinton said that new ideology spreads when there is discontent with the old regime. Extremists such as Lenin and Robespierre will overcome more moderate revolutionaries. This stage is soon followed by Thermidor, a reining back of revolutionary enthusiasm under pragmatists like Stalin and Napoleon Bonaparte who bring \"normalcy and equilibrium\".\nA very similar sequence (\"men of ideas>fanatics>practical men of action\") occurs in Eric Hoffer, The True Believer, and Brinton's sequence is reiterated by J. William Fulbright.\nThe revolution thus becomes established as an Ideocracy, but its rise is likely to be checked by a Political midlife crisis.\n\nEven when the challenging of existing beliefs is encouraged, as in scientific theories, the dominant paradigm or mindset can prevent certain challenges, theories, or experiments from being advanced.\n\nA special case of science adopted as ideology is that of ecology, which studies the relationships among living things on Earth. Perceptual psychologist James J. Gibson believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of self-awareness and cognition itself. Linguist George Lakoff has proposed a cognitive science of mathematics wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception—which is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology.\n\nDeep ecology and the modern ecology movement (and, to a lesser degree, Green parties) appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology.\n\nSome accuse ecological economics of likewise turning scientific theory into political economy, although theses in that science can often be tested. The modern practice of green economics fuses both approaches and seems to be part science, part ideology.\n\nThis is far from the only theory of economics raised to ideology status. Some notable economically based ideologies include neoliberalism, monetarism, mercantilism, mixed economy, social Darwinism, communism, laissez-faire economics, and free trade. There are also current theories of safe trade and fair trade that can be seen as ideologies.\n\nPsychological research increasingly suggests that ideologies reflect (unconscious) motivational processes, as opposed to the view that political convictions always reflect independent and unbiased thinking. Jost, Ledgerwood and Hardin proposed in 2008 that ideologies may function as prepackaged units of interpretation that spread because of basic human motives to understand the world, avoid existential threat, and maintain valued interpersonal relationships. These authors conclude that such motives may lead disproportionately to the adoption of system-justifying worldviews. Psychologists have generally found that personality traits, individual difference variables, needs, and ideological beliefs seem to have a common thread.\n\nAccording to the semiotician Bob Hodge, ideology \"identifies a unitary object that incorporates complex sets of meanings with the social agents and processes that produced them. No other term captures this object as well as 'ideology'. Foucault's 'episteme' is too narrow and abstract, not social enough. His 'discourse', popular because it covers some of ideology's terrain with less baggage, is too confined to verbal systems. 'Worldview' is too metaphysical, 'propaganda' too loaded. Despite or because of its contradictions, 'ideology' still plays a key role in semiotics oriented to social, political life.\" Authors such as Michael Freeden have also recently incorporated a semantic analysis to the study of ideologies.\n\nSociologists define ideology as \"cultural beliefs that justify particular social arrangements, including patterns of inequality.\" Dominant groups use these sets of cultural beliefs and practices to justify the systems of inequality that maintain their group's social power over non-dominant groups. Ideologies use a society's symbol system to organize social relations in a hierarchy, with some social identities being superior to other social identities, which are considered inferior. The dominant ideology in a society is passed along through the society's major social institutions, such as the media, the family, education, and religion. As societies changed throughout history, so did the ideologies that justified systems of inequality.\n\nSociological examples of ideologies include: racism; sexism; heterosexism; ableism; and ethnocentrism.\n\n\n\n"}

(See section III.5.4, p. 201, in H. Schubert.)\n\nLikewise, the same continuous map induces a group homomorphism between the respective homotopy groups, the respective homology groups (IV.1.3, pp. 240–241) and a homomorphism going in the opposite direction between the corresponding cohomology groups (IV.4.2–3, pp. 298–299).\n\nA homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two mathematical objects of the same type: a group homomorphism, for instance, is a map between two groups such that the image of the product of any two group items is the same as the product of their images, while a graph homomorphism is a map from the vertices of one undirected graph to the vertices of another such that any edge of the first graph is mapped to an edge of the second. Families of objects, and maps between them, are generally formalized as objects and morphisms in a category; by convention, the morphisms in categories are depicted as arrows in diagrams. In many of the\nimportant categories of mathematics, the morphisms are called homomorphisms. In category theory, a functor is itself a structure-preserving map, between categories: it must map objects to objects, and morphisms to morphisms, in a way that is compatible with the composition of morphisms within the category. \n\nIf \"F\" is a functor from category \"A\" to category \"B\", ƒ is a morphism in category \"A\", and the morphisms of category \"B\" are called homomorphisms, then \"F\"(ƒ) is the homomorphism induced from ƒ by \"F\".\n\nFor example, let \"X\" and \"Y\" be topological spaces with fundamental groups π(\"X\",\"x\") and π(\"Y\",\"y\") respectively, with specified base points \"x\" and \"y\". If ƒ is a continuous function from \"X\" to \"Y\" that maps the base points to each other (that is, ƒ(\"x\") = \"y\") then any loop based at \"x\" may be composed with ƒ to make a loop based at \"y\". This map of loops respects homotopy equivalence of loops: one can map any element of π(\"X\",\"x\") to π(\"Y\",\"y\") by choosing a loop representing the element, using ƒ to map that representative loop to \"Y\", and selecting the homotopy equivalence class of the resulting mapped loop. Thus, ƒ corresponds to a homomorphism of fundamental groups; this homomorphism is called the induced homomorphism of ƒ. \n\nThe construction of a fundamental group for each topological space, and of an induced homomorphism of fundamental groups for each continuous function, forms a functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of groups. See fundamental group#Functoriality for more on this type of induced homomorphism.\n\n"}

By contrast, an outgroup is a social group with which an individual does not identify. For example, people may find it psychologically meaningful to view themselves according to their race, culture, gender, age, or religion. It has been found that the psychological membership of social groups and categories is associated with a wide variety of phenomena.\n\nThe terminology was made popular by Henri Tajfel and colleagues during his work in formulating social identity theory. The significance of ingroup and outgroup categorization was identified using a method called the minimal group paradigm. Tajfel and colleagues found that people can form self-preferencing ingroups within a matter of minutes and that such groups can form even on the basis of completely arbitrary and invented discriminatory characteristics, such as preferences for certain paintings.\n\nThe psychological categorization of people into ingroup and outgroup members is associated with a variety of phenomena. The following examples have all received a great deal of academic attention.\n\nThis refers to the fact that under certain conditions, people will prefer and have affinity for one’s ingroup over the outgroup, or anyone viewed as outside the ingroup. This can be expressed in one's evaluation of others, linking, allocation of resources, and many other ways.\n\nDiscrimination between ingroups and outgroups is a matter of favoritism towards an ingroup and the absence of equivalent favoritism towards an outgroup. Outgroup derogation is the phenomenon in which an outgroup is perceived as being threatening to the members of an ingroup. This phenomenon often accompanies ingroup favoritism, as it requires one to have an affinity towards their ingroup. Some research suggests that outgroup derogation occurs when an outgroup is perceived as blocking or hindering the goals of an ingroup. It has also been argued that outgroup derogation is a natural consequence of the categorization process.\n\nPeople have been shown to be differentially influenced by ingroup members. That is, under conditions where group categorization is psychologically salient, people will shift their beliefs in line with ingroup social norms.\n\nThis generally refers to the tendency of groups to make decisions that are more extreme than the initial inclination of its members, although polarization toward the most central beliefs has also been observed. It has been shown that this effect is related to a psychologically salient ingroup and outgroup categorization.\n\nCategorization of people into social groups increases the perception that group members are similar to one another. An outcome of this is the outgroup homogeneity effect. This refers to the perception of members of an outgroup as being homogenous, while members of one's ingroup are perceived as being diverse, e.g. \"they are alike; we are diverse”. This is especially likely to occur in regard to negative characteristics. Under certain conditions, ingroup members can be perceived as being similar to one another in regard to positive characteristics. This effect is called ingroup homogeneity.\n\nIn evolutionary psychology, ingroup favoritism is seen as an evolved mechanism selected for the advantages of coalition affiliation. It has been argued that characteristics such as gender and ethnicity are inflexible or even essential features of such systems. However, there is evidence that elements of favoritism are flexible in that they can be erased by changes in social categorization. One study in the field of behavioural genetics suggests that biological mechanisms may exist which favor a coexistence of both flexible and essentialist systems.\n"}

Pardee Center for International Futures. Initially created by Barry B. Hughes of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver in Colorado, the model is free for public use in both its online and downloadable forms. \n\nThe Pardee Center for International Futures has partnered with many organizations to produce forecasts and data analysis. IFs has been utilized in the National Intelligence Council's \"Global Trends 2020\", \"Global Trends 2025\", and \"Global Trends 2030\" report. The International Futures model has also contributed to the United Nations \"Human Development Report\" and the \"Global Environmental Outlook\".\n\nIFs is hosted free for public use by Google Public Data Explorer, the Atlantic Council, and the Institute for Security Studies.\n\nThe model incorporates dynamically linked sub-models. They include: population, economic, agricultural, educational, energy, socio-political, international political, environmental, health, infrastructure and technology. IFs is a unique modeling tool because it endogenizes the impact of such a wide range of global systems for 183 countries.\n\nThe help system that accompanies the software provides an extensive overview of the model structure and computer code used to write the model. IFs has three main functions, all connected to its conceptual treatment of integrated assessment forecasts: data analysis, scenario analysis, and display.\n\nThe data analysis section of IFs represents a collection of over 2,000 data series from all major international data gatherers. It is constantly updated with new data series. This data forms the foundation of the model structure. Users can analyze historic data cross-sectionally, longitudinally or on a world map. Using cross-sectional analysis, users can select a variables and plot this against up to 5 independent variables. It is then possible to animate the map to see how the cross-sectional relationship changes across the 40+ years of data in the database. Longitudinally, users can plot the relationship between a dependent variable and time, from 1960 (for most data series) through the most recent data year available. A world map allows users to display data from any of these series using GIS options.\n\nThe software allows users to access and change the parameters and variables that are used in the model. The Scenario Analysis display lets users create their own global scenario or load a pre-run global scenario in their field of interest. For example, to analyze the effects of a policy intervention on different sub-models and variables within the model, make the changes to the appropriate variable and then analyze the results in comparison to the base-case. Many pre-run scenarios come packaged with the model, including work that has been completed for the United Nations Environment Programme and the National Intelligence Council.\n\nThis portion of the software allows users to display the forecast results of their scenario analyses for different provinces, countries and groups across different issue areas. Some of the specialized displays include: population, educational attainment, mortality rate, World Values Survey, Gini coefficient, the Millennium Development Goals, social accounting matrix, advanced sustainability analysis, and World Bank financial flows.\n\nThe project received a gift from Frederick S. Pardee, formerly of RAND, to construct the Pardee Center for International Futures at the University of Denver. It is responsible for the further institutionalization of the software, training sessions, and the continued work on the \"Patterns of Potential Human Progress\" (PPHP) volumes. The first PPHP volume discusses reduction in global poverty; the second, global education; the third, health care systems; the fourth, global infrastructure; the fifth, domestic governance.\n\nThe journal Poverty and Public Policy reviewed the first PPHP volume, and concluded the following:\n\nThe African Futures Project is a collaboration between the Institute for Security Studies and the Pardee Center for International Futures to promote long term strategic planning for African development. This collaboration has led to the publication of various African Futures Project Policy Briefs, monographs on long-term African Development and a website where the IFs model can be used specifically for exploring African development.\n\n"}

{"id": "5453152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5453152", "title": "Law of attraction (New Thought)", "text": "Law of attraction (New Thought)\n\nIn the New Thought philosophy, the Law of Attraction is the belief that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, people can bring positive or negative experiences into their life. The belief is based on the idea that people and their thoughts are both made from pure energy, and that through the process of like energy attracting like energy a person can improve their own health, wealth, and personal relationships.\n\nThe Law of Attraction is among the most popular of the Universal Laws. Advocates of this mind-power paradigm generally combine cognitive reframing techniques with affirmations and creative visualization to replace limiting or self-destructive (\"negative\") thoughts with more empowered, adaptive (\"positive\") thoughts. A key component of the philosophy is that in order to effectively change one's negative thinking patterns, one must also \"feel\" (through creative visualization) that the desired changes have already occurred. This combination of positive thought and positive emotion is believed to allow one to attract positive experiences and opportunities by achieving resonance with the proposed energetic law.\n\nThe Law of Attraction has no scientific basis and has been dubbed a pseudoscience. A number of researchers have criticized the misuse of scientific concepts by its proponents.\n\nThe New Thought movement (Law of Attraction Origins) grew out of the teachings of Phineas Quimby in the early 19th century. Early in his life, Quimby was diagnosed with tuberculosis. However, medicinal treatment wasn't working, so he began carriage riding through his hometown, Lebanon, New Hampshire. He then regained his health and recovered, an event that prompted his study of \"mind over body\". Although he never used the words 'Law of Attraction', he explained this in a statement that captured the concept in the field of health: \n\nIn 1877, the term 'Law of Attraction' appeared in print for the first time in a book written by the Russian occultist Helena Blavatsky, in a context alluding to an attractive power existing between elements of spirit. (Her book \"Isis Unveiled\" discusses esoteric mysteries of ancient theosophy.)\n\nBut the one who really first articulated the Law as general principle was Prentice Mulford. Mulford, a pivotal figure in the development of New Thought thinking, discusses the Law of Attraction at length in, for example, his essay \"The Law of Success\", published 1886-1887. In this, Mulford was followed by other New Thought authors, such as Henry Wood (starting with his \"God’s Image in Man\", 1892), and Ralph Waldo Trine (starting with his first book, \"What All the World's A-Seeking\", 1896). For these authors, the Law of Attraction is concerned not only about health but every aspect of life.\n\nThe 20th century saw a surge in interest in the subject with many books being written about it, amongst which are two of the best-selling books of all time; Think and Grow Rich (1937) by Napoleon Hill and You Can Heal Your Life (1984) by Louise Hay.\n\nEven if the New Age movement adopted many New Thought ideas, including that of the Law of Attraction, the Law of Attraction remains a new thought philosophical concept.\n\nIn 2006, the concept of the Law of Attraction gained a lot of renewed exposure with the release of the film \"The Secret\" (2006) which was then developed into a book of the same title in 2007. The movie and book gained widespread media coverage. Rhonda Byrne's book also has influenced the creation of an untitled fiction film based on The Secret, starring Katie Holmes. This was followed by a sequel, The Power in 2010 that talks about the law of attraction being the law of love.\n\nNew Thought authors believe that the Law of Attraction is always in operation and that it brings to each person the conditions and experiences that they predominantly think about, or which they desire or expect.\n\nCharles Haanel wrote in \"The Master Key System\" (1912):\nRalph Trine wrote in \"In Tune With The Infinite\" (1897):\n\nThe New Thought concept of the Law of Attraction is rooted in ideas that come from various philosophical and religious traditions. In particular, it has been inspired by Hermeticism, New England transcendentalism, specific verses from the Bible, and Hinduism, \nHermeticism influenced the development of European thought in the Renaissance. Its ideas were transmitted partly through alchemy. In the 18th century, Franz Mesmer studied the works of alchemists such as Paracelsus and van Helmont. Van Helmont was a 17th-century Flemish physician who proclaimed the curative powers of the imagination. This lead Mesmer to develop his ideas about Animal magnetism which Phineas Quimby, the founder of New Thought, studied.\n\nThe Transcendentalist movement developed in the United States immediately before the emergence of New Thought and is thought to have had a great influence on it. George Ripley, an important figure in that movement, stated that its leading idea was \"the supremacy of mind over matter\".\n\nNew Thought authors often quote certain verses from the Bible in the context of the Law of Attraction. An example is Mark 11:24: \"Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.\"\n\nIn the late 19th century Swami Vivekananda traveled to the United States and gave lectures on Hinduism. These talks greatly influenced the New Thought movement and in particular, William Walker Atkinson who was one of New Thought's pioneers.\n\n\"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine criticized the lack of falsifiability and testability of these claims. Critics have asserted that the evidence provided is usually anecdotal and that, because of the self-selecting nature of the positive reports, as well as the subjective nature of any results, these reports are susceptible to confirmation bias and selection bias. Physicist Ali Alousi, for instance, criticized it as unmeasurable and questioned the likelihood that thoughts can affect anything outside the head.\n\nThe Law of Attraction has been popularized in the early 21st century by books and films such as \"The Secret\". This 2006 film and the subsequent book use interviews with New Thought authors and speakers to explain the principles of the proposed metaphysical law that one can attract anything that one thinks about consistently. Writing for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, Mary Carmichael and Ben Radford wrote that \"neither the film nor the book has any basis in scientific reality\", and that its premise contains \"an ugly flipside: if you have an accident or disease, it's your fault\".\n\nOthers have questioned the references to modern scientific theory, and have maintained, for example, that the Law of Attraction misrepresents the electrical activity of brainwaves. Victor Stenger and Leon Lederman are critical of attempts to use quantum mysticism to bridge any unexplained or seemingly implausible effects, believing these to be traits of modern pseudoscience.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41184474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41184474", "title": "Lingam", "text": "Lingam\n\nA lingam (Sanskrit: लिङ्गम्, , lit. \"sign, symbol or mark\"), sometimes referred to as \"linga\" or \"Shiva linga\", is an abstract or aniconic representation of the Hindu deity Shiva in Shaivism. It is a votary symbol revered in temples, smaller shrines, or as self-manifested natural objects. The lingam is often represented within a lipped, disc-shaped platform called a yoni that symbolizes goddess Shakti. Lingayats wear a lingam inside a necklace, called Ishtalinga.\n\nLingam is additionally found in ancient Sanskrit texts with the meaning of \"evidence, proof\", or in sexual context where it means the \"male generative organ, phallus\". Lingam iconography found at archaeological sites of the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia include simple cylinders set inside a \"yoni\", rounded pillars with carvings such as of one or more \"mukha\" (faces), and anatomically realistic representations of an erect phallus such as at Gudimallam.\n\nLingam, states Monier Monier-Williams, appears in the Upanishads and epic literature, and it means a \"mark, sign, emblem, characteristic\". Other contextual meanings of the term include \"evidence, proof, symptom\", and \"gender, male organ, phallus\". The term also appears in early Indian texts on logic, where an inference is based on a sign (linga), such as \"if there is smoke, there is fire\" where the linga is the smoke. According to James Lochtefeld, it is sometimes \"simplistically called a phallic symbol\". It is a religious symbol in Hinduism representing Shiva as the generative power, all of existence, all creativity and fertility at every cosmic level.\nThe lingam of the Shaivism tradition is a short cylindrical pillar-like symbol of Shiva, made of stone, metal, gem, wood, clay or disposable material. According to \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", the lingam is a votary aniconic object found in the sanctum of Shiva temples and private shrines that symbolizes Shiva and is \"revered as an emblem of generative power\". It often is found within a lipped, disked structure that is an emblem of goddess Shakti and this is called the \"yoni\". Together they symbolize the union of the feminine and the masculine principles, and \"the totality of all existence\", states \"Encyclopædia Britannica\". \n\nAccording to Rohit Dasgupta, the lingam symbolizes Shiva in Hinduism, and it is also a phallic symbol. Since the 19th-century, states Dasgupta, the popular literature has represented the lingam as the male sex organ. This view contrasts with the traditional abstract values they represent in Shaivism wherein the lingam-yoni connote the masculine and feminine principles in the entirety of creation and all existence. According to Wendy Doniger, for many Hindus, the lingam is not a \"male sexual organ\" but of a spiritual icon and their faith, just like for the Christians the cross is not an \"instrument of execution\" but a symbol of Christ and the Christian faith.\n\nAccording to Alex Wayman, given the Shaiva philosophical texts and spiritual interpretations, various works on Shaivism by some Indian authors \"deny that the linga is a phallus\". To the Shaivites, a linga is neither a phallus nor do they practice the worship of erotic penis-vulva, rather the linga-yoni is a symbol of cosmic mysteries, the creative powers and the metaphor for the spiritual truths of their faith.\n\nAccording to Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, the lingam signifies three perfections of Shiva. The upper oval part of the Shivalingam represent Parashiva and lower part of the Shivalingam called the pitha represents Parashakti. In Parashiva perfection, Shiva is the absolute reality, the timeless, formless and spaceless. In Parashakti perfection, Shiva is all-pervasive, pure consciousness, power and primal substance of all that exists and it has form unlike Parashiva which is formless.\n\nAccording to Nagendra Singh, some believe linga-worship was a feature of indigenous Indian religion.\n\nAccording to Chakrabarti, \"some of the stones found in Mohenjodaro are unmistakably phallic stones\". These are dated to some time before 2300 BCE. Similarly, states Chakrabarti, the Kalibangan site of Harappa has a small terracotta representation that \"would undoubtedly be considered the replica of a modern Shivlinga [a tubular stone].\" According to Encyclopedia Britannica, while Harappan discoveries include \"short cylindrical pillars with rounded tops\", there is no evidence that the people of Indus Valley Civilization worshipped these artifacts as lingams. \n\nThe colonial era archaeologists John Marshall and Ernest Mackay proposed that certain artifacts found at Harappan sites may be evidence of yoni-linga worship in Indus Valley Civilization. Scholars such as Arthur Llewellyn Basham dispute whether such artifacts discovered at the archaeological sites of Indus Valley sites are yoni. For example, Jones and Ryan state that lingam/yoni shapes have been recovered from the archaeological sites at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, part of the Indus Valley Civilisation. In contrast, Indologist Wendy Doniger states that this relatively rare artifact can be interpreted in many ways and has unduly been used for wild speculations such as being a linga. Another postage stamp sized item found and called the \"Pashupati seal\", states Doniger, has an image with a general resemblance with Shiva and \"the Indus people may well have created the symbolism of the divine phallus\", but given the available evidence we cannot be certain, nor do we know that it had the same meaning as some currently project them to might have meant.\n\nAccording to the Indologist Asko Parpola, \"it is true that Marshall's and Mackay's hypotheses of linga and yoni worship by the Harappans has rested on rather slender grounds, and that for instance the interpretation of the so-called ring-stones as yonis seems untenable\". He quotes Dales 1984 paper, which states \"with the single exception of the unidentified photography of a realistic phallic object in Marshall's report, there is no archaeological evidence to support claims of special sexually-oriented aspects of Harappan religion\". However, adds Parpola, a re-examination at Indus Valley sites suggest that the Mackay's hypothesis cannot be ruled out because erotic and sexual scenes such as ithyphallic males, naked females, a human couple having intercourse and trefoil imprints have now been identified at the Harappan sites. The \"finely polished circular stand\" found by Mackay may be yoni although it was found without the linga. The absence of linga, states Parpola, maybe because it was made from wood which did not survive.\n\nThe word \"lingam\" is not found in the \"Rigveda\", or the other Vedas. However, Rudra (proto-Shiva) is found in the Vedic literature. The word \"lingam\" appears in early Upanishads, but the context suggests that it simply means \"sign\" such as \"smoke is a sign of fire\", states Doniger.\nThere is a hymn in the Atharvaveda that praises a pillar (Sanskrit: \"stambha\"), and this is one possible origin of linga worship. According to Swami Vivekananda, the Shiva-linga had origins in the idea of \"Yupa-Stambha\" or Skambha of the Vedic rituals, where the term meant the sacrificial post which was then idealized as the eternal Brahman. The \"Yupa-Skambha\" gave place in time to the \"Shiva-Linga\", quite possibly with influence from Buddhism's stupa shaped like the top of a stone linga, according to Vivekananda.\n\nOne of the oldest example of a lingam is found in the Parashurameshwara temple, midst a hilly forest about east of Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. It is called the Gudimallam and is an active place of Shaiva worship. It has been dated to the 3rd-century BCE, or to the 2ndcentury BCE, and generally accepted to be from the 3rd- to 1st-century BCE. The structure anatomically resembles a phallus, has the figure of Shiva carved on the front with an antelope and axe in his hands. He stands above a \"rakshasha\" (demon) dwarf.\n\nThe Bhita linga – now at the Lucknow museum – is also dated to about the 2nd century BCE, and has four directional faces on the pillar and a Brahmi script inscription at the bottom. Above the four faces, the Bhita linga has the bust of a male with his left hand holding a vase and the right hand in the \"abhaya\" (no-fear) mudra. The pillar itself is, once again, a realistic depiction of human phallus.\n\nThe Mathura archaeological site has revealed similar lingams with a standing Shiva in front (2nd century CE) and with one or four faces around the pillar (1st to 3rd century CE).\n\nNumerous stone and cave temples from the mid to late 1st-millennium feature lingams. The Bhumara Temple near Satna Madhya Pradesh, for example, is generally dated to late 5th-century Gupta Empire era, and it features an Ekamukha Lingam.\n\nAccording to Doniger, the \"Mahabharata\" is the first ancient Hindu text where the \"lingam\" is \"unequivocally designating the sexual organ of Shiva\". Chapter 10.17 of the \"Mahabharata\" also refers to the word \"sthanu\" in the sense of an \"inanimate pillar\" as well as a \"name of Shiva, signifying the immobile, ascetic, desexualized form of the \"lingam\"\", as it recites the legend involving Shiva, Brahma and Prajapati. This mythology weaves two polarities, one where the lingam represents the potentially procreative phallus (fertile lingam) and its opposite \"a pillar-like renouncer of sexuality\" (ascetic lingam), states Doniger.\n\nThe \"Shiva Purana\" describes the origin of the lingam, known as Shiva-linga, as the beginning-less and endless cosmic pillar (\"Stambha\") of fire, the cause of all causes. Lord Shiva is pictured as emerging from the lingamthe cosmic pillar of fireproving his superiority over the gods Brahma and Vishnu. This is known as Lingodbhava. The \"Linga Purana\" also supports this interpretation of lingam as a cosmic pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva. According to the \"Linga Purana\", the lingam is a complete symbolic representation of the formless Universe Bearerthe oval-shaped stone is the symbol of the Universe, and the bottom base represents the Supreme Power that holds the entire Universe in it. A similar interpretation is also found in the Skanda Purana: \"The endless sky (that great void which contains the entire universe) is the Linga, the Earth is its base. At the end of time the entire universe and all the Gods finally merge in the Linga itself.\" In the \"Linga Purana\", an Atharvaveda hymn is expanded with stories about the great Stambha and the supreme nature of Mahâdeva (the Great God, Shiva).\n\nIn early Sanskrit medical texts, \"linga\" means \"symptom, signs\" and plays a key role in the diagnosis of a sickness, the disease. The author of classical Sanskrit grammar treatise, Panini, states that the verbal root \"ling\" which means \"paint, variegate\", has the sense \"that which paints, variegates, characterizes\". Panini as well as Patanjali additionally mention lingam with the contextual meaning of the \"gender\".\n\nIn the \"Vaisheshika Sutras\", it means \"proof or evidence\", as a conditionally sufficient mark or sign. This Vaisheshika theory is adopted in the early Sanskrit medical literature. Like the Upanishads, where linga means \"mark, sign, characteristic\", the texts of the \"Nyaya\" school of Hindu philosophy use \"linga\" in the same sense. In the \"Samkhya sutras\", and in Gaudapada's commentary on \"Samkhyakarika\", the term \"linga\" has many contextual meanings such as in verses 1.124.136, 3.9.16 and 5.21.61, as it develops its theory of the nature of \"atman\" (soul) and \"sarira\" (body, prakriti) and its proposed mechanism of rebirth. In the \"Purva Mimamsa Sutra\" and the \"Vedanta sutra\", as well as the commentaries on them, the term linga appears quite often, particularly in the form of \"lingadarsanac ca\" as a form of citing or referencing prior Hindu literature. This phrase connotes \"[we have found an] indicative sign\", such as the \"indicative sign is in a Vedic passage\".\n\nThere is persuasive evidence in later Sanskrit literature, according to Doniger, that the early Indians associated the lingam icon with the male sexual organ. For example, the 11th-century Kashmir text \"Narmamala\" by Kshemendra on satire and fiction writing explains his ideas on parallelism with divine lingam and human lingam in a sexual context. Various Shaiva texts, such as the \"Skanda Purana\" in section 1.8 states that all creatures have the signs of Shiva or Shakti through their \"lingam\" (male sexual organ) or \"pindi\" (female sexual organ). However, the Sanskrit literature corpus is not consistent. A part of the literature corpus regards \"lingam\" to be sexual and the phallus of Shiva, while another group of texts does not. Sexuality in the former is inherently sacred and spiritual, while the latter emphasizes the ascetic nature of Shiva and renunciation to be spiritual symbolism of \"lingam\". This tension between the pursuit of spirituality through householder lifestyle and the pursuit of renunciate sannyasi lifestyle is historic, reflects the different interpretations of the lingam and what lingam worship means to its devotees. It remains a continuing debate within Hinduism to this day, states Doniger. To one group, it is a part of Shiva's body and symbolically \"saguna\" Shiva (he in a physical form with attributes). To the other group, it is an abstract symbol of \"nirguna\" Shiva (he in the universal Absolute Reality, formless, without attributes). In Tamil Shaiva tradition, for example, the common term for lingam is \"kuRi\" or \"sign, mark\" which is nonsexual. Similarly, in Lingayatism tradition, the lingam is a spiritual symbol and \"was never said to have any sexual connotations\", according to Doniger. To some Shaivites, it symbolizes the axis of the universe.\n\nThe term Linga also appears in Buddhist and Jaina literature, where it means \"sign, evidence\" in one context, or \"subtle body\" with sexual connotations in another.\n\nAfter the 11th-century invasion of the subcontinent by Islamic armies, the iconoclast Muslims considered the lingam to be idolatrous representations of the male sexual organ. They took pride in destroying as many lingams and Shiva temples as they could, reusing them to build steps for mosques, in a region stretching from Somanath (Gujarat) to Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh) to Chidambaram (Tamil Nadu), states Doniger.\n\nThe colonial era Orientalists and Christian missionaries, raised in the Victorian mold where sex and sexual imagery were a taboo subject, were shocked by and were hostile to the lingam-yoni iconography and reverence they witnessed. The 19th and early 20th-century colonial and missionary literature described lingam-yoni, and related theology as obscene, corrupt, licentious, hyper-sexualized, puerile, impure, demonic and a culture that had become too feminine and dissolute. To the Hindus, particularly the Shaivites, these icons and ideas were the abstract, a symbol of the entirety of creation and spirituality. The colonial disparagement in part triggered the opposite reaction from Bengali nationalists, who more explicitly valorised the feminine. Vivekananda called for the revival of the Mother Goddess as a feminine force, inviting his countrymen to \"proclaim her to all the world with the voice of peace and benediction\".\n\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, the terms lingam and yoni became explicitly associated with human sexual organs in the western imagination after the widely popular first \"Kamasutra\" translation by Sir Richard Burton in 1883. In his translation, even though the original Sanskrit text does not use the words lingam or yoni for sexual organs, and almost always uses other terms, Burton adroitly avoided been viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by avoiding the use of words such as penis, vulva, vagina and other direct or indirect sexual terms in the Sanskrit text to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation. This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to \"anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away.\" Similar Orientalist literature of the Christian missionaries and the British era, states Doniger, stripped all spiritual meanings and insisted on the Victorian vulgar interpretation only, which had \"a negative effect on the self-perception that Hindus had of their own bodies\" and they became \"ashamed of the more sensual aspects of their own religious literature\". Some contemporary Hindus, states Doniger, in their passion to spiritualize Hinduism and for their Hindutva campaign have sought to sanitize the historic earthly sexual meanings, and insist on the abstract spiritual meaning only.\n\nThe traditional lingam rituals in major Shiva temples includes offerings of flowers, grass, dried rice, fruits, leaves, water and a milk bath. Priests chant hymns, while the devotees go the sanctum for a \"darshana\" followed by a clockwise circumambulation of the sanctum. On the sanctum walls, typically are reliefs of Dakshinamurti, Brahma and Vishnu. Often, near the sanctum are other shrines, particularly for Shakti (Durga), Ganesha and Murugan (Kartikeya). In the Hindu tradition, special pilgrimage sites include those where natural lingams are found in the form of cylindrical rocks or ice or rocky hill. These are called \"Svayambhuva\" lingam, and about 70 of these are known on the Indian subcontinent, the most significant being one in Kashi (Varanasi) followed by Prayaga, Naimisha and Gaya.\n\nThe historic lingam iconography has included:\n\n\nA lingam may be made of clay (mrinmaya), metal (lohaja), precious stone (ratnaja), wood (daruja), stone (sailaja, most common), or a disposal material (kshanika). The construction method, proportions and design is described in Shaiva Agama texts. The lingam is typically set in the center of a pindika (also called yoni or pithas, symbolizing Shakti). A pindika may be circular, square, octagonal, hexagonal, duodecagonal, sixteen sided, alliptical, triangular or another shape. Some lingams are miniaturized and they are carried on one's person, such as by Lingayats in a necklace. These are called \"chala-lingams\". The Hindu temple design manuals recommend geometric ratios for the linga, the sanctum and the various architectural features of the temple according to certain mathematical rules it considers perfect and sacred. Anthropologist Christopher John Fuller states that although most sculpted images (murtis) are anthropomorphic or theriomorphic, the aniconic Shiva Linga is an important exception.\n\nAccording to Shaiva Siddhanta, the linga is the ideal substrate in which the worshipper should install and worship the five-faced and ten-armed Sadāśiva, the form of Shiva who is the focal divinity of that school of Shaivism.\n\nThe various styles of lingam iconography are found on the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia.\n\n\nMeaning: Rudra is meaning. Uma is word. Prostrations to Him and Her. Rudra is Linga. Uma is Pitha. Prostrations to Him and Her.\n\n\nMeaning: The microcosm and the macrocosm are one and the same; so also the Linga and Sutratman, Svabhava (substance) and form and the self-resplendent light and Chidatma.\n\n\nMeaning: By these twenty-two names ending with salutations they consecrate the Sivalinga for all – the Linga which is representative of soma and Surya, and holding which in the hand holy formulas are repeated and which purifies all.\n\n\nMeaning: Thus after worshipping with nectar (Ananda Amrutha) the four fold Brahmas (Devatha, Teacher, Mantra and the soul), Vishnu, Rudra separately and then together in the form of Linga with offerings and then unifying the linga forms in the Atma Jyothi (Light of the soul) \n\n\nMeaning: The twelve Adityas, eleven Rudras, eight Vasus, seven sages, Brahma, Narada, five Vinayakas, Viresvara, Rudresvara, Ambikesvara, Ganesvara, Nilakanthesvara, Visvesvara, Gopalesvara, Bhadresvara, and 24 other lingas reside there\n\n\nMeaning: The midst of the Yoni is the Linga facing the west and split at its head like the gem. He who knows this, is a knower of the Vedas.\n\n\nMeaning: Having given up Matra, Linga and Pada, he attains the subtle Pada (seat or word) without vowels or consonants by means of the letter ‘M’ without the Svara (accent).\n\n\n\n\nLingayats, a sect of the Shaivite religious tradition in India, wear a miniaturized linga called the \"istalinga\". Initially known as \"Veerashaivas\" (heroic worshippers of Shiva), since the 18th century adherents of this faith are known as \"Lingayats\". This tradition originated in Karnataka around the 12th-century. Lingayatism is derived from the term \"linga\" and suffix \"ayta\". The term Lingayat is based on the practice of both genders of Lingayats wearing an \"iṣṭaliṅga\" (also called \"karasthala-linga\") contained inside a box with a necklace all the time. The \"istalinga\" is a personalized and miniature oval-shaped linga and an emblem of their faith symbolising Parashiva, the absolute reality and their spirituality. It is viewed as a \"living, moving\" divinity within the Lingayat devotee. Everyday, the devotee removes this personal linga from its box, places it in left palm, offers puja and then meditates about becoming one with the linga, in his or her journey towards the \"atma-linga\".\n\nAn ice lingam at Amarnath in the western Himalayas forms every winter from ice dripping on the floor of a cave and freezing like a stalagmite. It is very popular with pilgrims.\nIn Kadavul Temple, a 700-pound, 3-foot-tall, naturally formed Spatika(quartz) lingam is installed. In future this crystal lingam will be housed in the Iraivan Temple. it is claimed as among the largest known spatika self formed (Swayambhu) lingams. Hindu scripture rates crystal as the highest form of Siva lingam.\n\nShivling, , is a mountain in Uttarakhand (the Garhwal region of Himalayas). It arises as a sheer pyramid above the snout of the Gangotri Glacier. The mountain resembles a Shiva lingam when viewed from certain angles, especially when travelling or trekking from Gangotri to Gomukh as part of a traditional Hindu pilgrimage.\n\nA lingam is also the basis for the formation legend (and name) of the Borra Caves in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nBanalinga are the lingam which are found on the bed of the Narmada river.\n\nBhuteshwar shivling is a natural rock shivling in Chhattisgarh whose height is increasing with each passing year. Sidheshvar Nath Temple's shivling is also a natural rock lingam in Arunachal Pradesh. It is believed to be the tallest natural lingam.\n\n\n"}

This means that the Constitution cannot be interpreted in the same way as an ordinary statute. Rather, it must be read within the context of society to ensure that it adapts and reflects changes. If constitutional interpretation adheres to the Framer's Intent and remains rooted in the past, the Constitution would not be reflective of society and eventually fall into disuse. \n\nHowever, \"natural limits\" cannot be granted too elastic a definition. In the Marcotte trilogy, it was held that payments by credit card could not be considered to fall within the federal bills of exchange power, as there had been no shift in how a bill of exchange is defined in Canada.\n\nThe interpretation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms also makes use of the living tree doctrine. Chief Justice Antonio Lamer stated in \"Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act\", \"If the newly planted 'living tree' which is the Charter is to have the possibility of growth and adjustment over time, care must be taken to ensure that historical materials, such as the Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee, do not stunt its growth.\"\n\n"}

She obtained her B.S. in English and Education with a minor in speech and theatre at the University of Minnesota, where she was elected Phi Beta Kappa. She was a member of Delta Gamma sorority. Gergen later obtained her M.S. in Educational Psychology with a specialization in counseling at the University of Minnesota. Mary Gergen earned a Ph.D. at Temple University in Social Psychology.\n\nMoving to Boston with her first husband, Michael Gebhart, and their two children, Lisa and Michael, she worked at Harvard University as a research assistant in the Social Relations Department, and later at the Harvard Business School in marketing. In 1969 she married Kenneth J. Gergen and moved to Rose Valley, Pennsylvania.\n\nSince the 1970s, she has been a member of the American Psychological Association, and a founding member and fellow of Div. 35, The Society for the Psychology of Women.\n\nIn 1980, Mary Gergen earned a Ph.D. in Psychology at Temple University, with a specialization in Social Psychology. She also worked for four years as a psychological consultant for AT&T on their longitudinal study of managers' lives.\n\nGergen began her teaching career at Penn State, Brandywine in 1984 as an assistant professor in Psychology and Women's studies. In 1988-89, Gergen was a fellow at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study. She won the George W. Atherton teaching award, a university wide honor, in 1966, and became a full professor. Gergen was given the title of Emerita upon retiring from the college in 2006.\n\nIn the early 1990s, she was one of the seven founders of The Taos Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to the development of social constructionist ideas within diverse practice areas, including therapy, organizational consulting, and education. She is a co-creator of the positive aging newsletter healthandage.com, an electronically distributed news source designed to reconstruct the negative stereotype of aging, and to provide an alternative that is more promising in potential. She also edits the \"Tempo Book\" series. Mary Gergen travels internationally to give lectures and workshops and serves on examination committees and as an external examiner for Ph.D. theses from many countries, in addition to supervising several doctoral dissertations and teaching in a theoretical psychology program at Massey University, NZ.\n\nGergen’s major contributions lie at the intersection of feminist theory, and social constructionist ideas. Her attempt, at the outset, was to develop an alternative in studies of gender to both the hegemonic empiricist mode and the feminist standpoint orientation. This alternative grew from her engagement with social constructionist theory.\n\nHer first major effort to address this shift “Towards a feminist methodology” appeared in her edited book, \"Feminist Thought and the Structure of Knowledge\" in 1988. Later, her reader, \"Toward a New Psychology of Gender\" (1997), edited with Sara N. Davis, attempted to exemplify the new potentials for the field. Her work on gender issues is primarily qualitative, with a special emphasis on narrative methods. A major focus of this work has been on gendered narratives, and their implications for women's careers. Her interest in narrative has recently led her to a concern with narratives of nature, and the human-environmental connection.\n\nGergen has also been innovating in developing a field of performative psychology, in which dramatic presentations are featured as a way of both carrying out research and communicating with peers and public. A pioneer of this approach in psychology, her first solo performance, “From Mod-Masculinity to Post-Mod Macho: A Feminist Re-play” was presented at a symposium on ‘Postmodernity and Psychology” in Aarhus, Denmark, June, 1989. In her writing she also attempts to expand beyond conventional forms in order to bring forth multiple perspectives and to challenge existing forms of order. Examples of this approach can be found in what may be her most important work, \"Reconstructing Psychology: Narrative, Gender and Performance\" (2001).\n\n\n"}

Mooning is used in the English-speaking world to express protest, scorn, disrespect, or provocation, or can be done for shock value, fun, or as a form of exhibitionism. \n\nSome jurisdictions regard mooning to be indecent exposure, sometimes depending on the context.\n\n\"Moon\" has been a common shape metaphor for the buttocks in English since 1743, and the verb \"to moon\" has meant \"to expose to (moon)light\" since 1601. As documented by McLaren, \"'mooning', or exposing one's butt to shame an enemy ... had a long pedigree in peasant culture\" throughout the Middle Ages, and in many nations.\n\"Mooning\" is also defined as \"wandering idly\" and \"romantically pining\".\n\nAlthough the practice of mooning was widespread by the 19th century, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" dates the use of \"moon\" and \"mooning\" to describe the act to student slang of the 1960s, when the gesture became increasingly popular among students at universities in the United States.\n\nThe legal position related to mooning varies between jurisdictions; some consider it indecent exposure, while others classify it as legal self expression.\n\nIn 2016, mooning in a public place in Victoria was made a criminal offence/something for which one could be punished.\n\nWhakapohane is the Māori practice of baring one's buttocks with the intent to offend. It symbolises the birthing act and renders the recipient \"noa\" (\"base\"). A modern example was that of Mihi Kotukutuku Stirling. She stood on the marae (sacred area) and the chief of the Te Arawa tribes, Mita Taupopoki, objected telling her that she must get off \"his\" marae as she was a woman. She stood her ground and when he had finished his objections she defended her position. \n\nShe said that she was descended from a prior-born ancestor than the chief. She was not on \"his\" marae; she was on \"her\" marae. She exposed her genitals, telling the chief that that was where he came from. Those assembled were asked to gainsay her speech but no one came forward. The Maori gesture of Whakapohane had countered the argument that was aimed at her.\n\nIn January 2006, a Maryland state circuit court determined that mooning is a form of artistic expression protected by the First Amendment as a form of speech. \n\nThe court ruled that indecent exposure relates only to exposure of the genitals, adding that even though mooning was a \"disgusting\" and \"demeaning\" act to engage in, and had taken place in the presence of a minor, \"If exposure of half of the buttocks constituted indecent exposure, any woman wearing a thong at the beach at Ocean City would be guilty.\"\n\nDefense attorneys had cited a case from 1983 of a woman who was arrested after protesting in front of the U.S. Supreme Court building wearing nothing but a cardboard sign that covered the front of her body. In that case, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals had ruled that indecent exposure is limited to a person's genitalia. No review of the case by a higher court took place since prosecutors dropped the case after the ruling.\n\nIn California, an appellate court found in December 2000 that mooning does not constitute indecent exposure (and, therefore, does not subject the defendant to sex offender registration laws) unless it can be proven beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct was sexually motivated.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37070689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37070689", "title": "Murder of June Anne Devaney", "text": "Murder of June Anne Devaney\n\nThe Murder of June Anne Devaney was the murder of a girl aged 3 years 11 months which occurred on 15 May 1948 in which June Anne Devaney was abducted from her cot while an inpatient at Queen's Park Hospital in Blackburn, Lancashire. She was removed to the grounds of the hospital, where she was raped, before suffering extensive blunt force trauma to her skull by enduring her head being repeatedly swung into a sandstone wall. This assault caused the child to suffer extensive internal injuries and multiple skull fractures, causing June Anne to develop a fatal state of shock. Her murderer, 22-year-old Peter Griffiths, was arrested three months after the crime. He was subsequently tried and convicted of June Anne's murder and was hanged on 19 November 1948.\n\nTo solve the crime, police obtained the fingerprints of every male aged 16 and over who had been in the vicinity of Blackburn on the night of the murder to obtain the fingerprints of the perpetrator.\n\nThe investigation into the murder of June Anne Devaney would prove to be a milestone in the history of forensic science; this being the first time a mass fingerprinting exercise had been implemented to solve a murder in the United Kingdom.\n\nJune Anne Devaney had been admitted to the Queen's Park Hospital in Blackburn, Lancashire on 5 May 1948, to recover from a mild bout of pneumonia. She was placed in ward CH3 of the premises. Shortly after midnight on 15 May, nurse Gwendolyn Humphreys (who was in the ward's kitchen) heard a child's cry coming from the ward. She checked the ward, soothed the child and returned him to his cot, noting as she did so the child in the adjacent cot——June Anne Devaney —was sound asleep. She then returned to her duties. At 1:20 am, she felt a draught and noticed an open door at the end of the ward. She closed it, and saw both that June Anne's cot was empty, and adult footprints—made by stockinged feet—were visible upon the highly waxed floor. Ominously, the drop side of the cot was still in place, meaning the child had to have been lifted from her cot.\n\nNurse Humphreys made a quick search of the ward, desperately attempting to find June Anne. After 30 minutes of fruitless searching, she contacted the local police. They arrived at 1:55 am and fully searched the hospital and its grounds, finding the child's body at 3:17 am. Her body lay face down in the grass alongside an tall sandstone boundary wall some from the ward, and immediately apparent were extensive bloodstains and tearing to her nightdress, numerous skull fractures, and blood exuding from her nostrils. The area where her body was discovered was promptly cordoned off, and at 4:20 a.m., the Chief Constable of Blackburn Police contacted Scotland Yard, seeking the assistance of an experienced investigator.\n\nAs the child's body bore extensive injuries consistent with bludgeoning, the hospital became a crime scene, and the ward was secured and searched. A subsequent post mortem revealed that June Anne had died of shock due to both extensive internal injuries and multiple skull fractures. The internal injuries were consistent with the child having been raped, and the multiple, extensive fractures and blunt force trauma to her skull had been inflicted from the child being repeatedly swung into the boundary wall while her rapist and murderer had held her by her legs, ankles, or feet. Numerous teeth marks were also notable on her left buttock, and puncture wounds were found on one ankle. Considering the area where the body was discovered, plus soon being contacted by a taxi driver who informed police that he had picked up a man with a local accent close to the hospital on the night of the crime, Blackburn Police came to believe early in the investigation that the crime would very likely have been committed by a local person, or an individual with extensive local geographical knowledge.\n\nBeside Devaney's cot, a glass 1946 Winchester bottle, partially filled with sterile water, was found alongside further soiled footprints which were clearly visible on the highly polished hospital floor; furthermore, the pattern of these stockinged feet impressions evident throughout the ward revealed that June Anne's abductor and murderer had evidently removed his shoes after entering the premises before prowling throughout the ward to view each cot and bed before selecting June Anne's cot as the one from which he chose to abduct his victim. The bottle itself had inexplicably been removed from its customary place (a trolley at the end of the ward) and placed beside the child's cot. This bottle itself was examined for fingerprints, being found to contain several sets.\n\nAfter all hospital staff had their fingerprints compared against those upon the bottle, a team of detectives from the Lancashire Constabulary traced all individuals who could have had a legitimate reason to have been in the ward within two years prior to the murder for the purposes of both alibi tracing, and fingerprint comparison, before all were eliminated as suspects. Following the completion of this exhaustive task, one unidentified set of fingerprints remained. This set of fingerprints was declared by the head of the Lancashire Fingerprint Bureau to have belonged to the child's murderer.\n\nAfter first establishing that no match for this set of fingerprints could be found within the police fingerprint bureau—meaning the perpetrator had not previously been convicted of any crime—attention turned to every male at or over the age of 16 within the local community. In a joint effort between local police forces and senior detectives from Scotland Yard, the Detective Chief Inspector in charge of the investigation, DCI John Capstick, then proposed that every male at or over the age of 16 who lived or was in the vicinity of Blackburn (then a town of 123,000 inhabitants) between 14 and 15 May be fingerprinted. The public were asked to cooperate with police throughout this undertaking, with the promise that all records obtained would not be compared for usage in other cases, and that these records would be destroyed at the completion of this task.\n\nThe mass operation began, and a special card was developed so that the identifiable sections of the perpetrator's left hand found upon the bottle (the left forefinger, middle finger, ring finger and a section of the left palm) could be recorded swiftly. The card also recorded the individual's name, address, and National Identity Registration Number. Also on the card was a section pertaining to the individual's movements between 11 p.m. on 14 May and 2 a.m. 15 May.\n\nThe task-force to carry out this endeavour was led by Inspector W. Barton and comprised a team of 20 officers who, armed with details from the Electoral Register, set about the districts collecting fingerprints and comparing them against those upon the Winchester bottle. Over the course of two months, over 40,000 sets of prints were taken from more than 35,000 homes without a match being found. Upon completion of this exercise in late July, police then concentrated on people who had not been listed upon the Electoral Register. By way of checking the issue of ration books and the Registration Number of the individual by which they and their owners were identified, officers began tracing all male individuals whose fingerprints had not yet been collected.\n\nOne of the Blackburn addresses to be checked on 11 August was that of Peter Griffiths, a 22-year-old ex-serviceman who lived in Briley Street, and who worked as a packer on the night shift at a local flour mill. When asked to provide his fingerprints for comparison, Griffiths—whose niece had been in Queen's Park Hospital at the time June Anne had been abducted—supplied them without hesitation. At 3:00 p.m. on 12 August, a comparison for the fingerprints upon the Winchester bottle was made with the fingerprints obtained from Peter Griffiths.\n\nBy the time this comparison had been made, officers had taken 46,253 sets of fingerprints, and had less than 200 sets of prints left to check before the completion of their task.\n\nPeter Griffiths was arrested by DCI Capstick as he left his Blackburn home to attend work on the evening of 12 August. He was taken to Blackburn Police Headquarters, where he was formally cautioned as to his right to silence. During the ride to police headquarters, and throughout his first interview, Griffiths attempted to deny any involvement, although when confronted with the fact his fingerprints had been a perfect match for those upon the bottle, he turned towards DCI Capstick and stated: \"Well, if they are my fingerprints on the bottle, I'll tell you all about it.\"\n\nIn the statement he subsequently gave to detectives, Griffiths claimed that on the night of the 14th, he had chosen to go for a night's \"drinking alone\" in Blackburn, and that as a result of his heavy drinking, by closing time, he had become severely intoxicated. He had then chosen to walk around in an attempt to \"sober up\" before returning home. Griffiths then claimed to have spoken with a man in a parked car, whom he had asked to light his (Griffiths') cigarette. According to Griffiths, this man, noting his state of intoxication, had said to him: \"Get in, open the window and I'll give you a spin.\" This man had soon parked his car in close proximity to Queen's Park Hospital, and it had been at this stage at which Griffiths had chosen to break into the premises to commit his crime. He had, he stated, picked up the Winchester bottle to use as a weapon in the event any member of staff had attempted to challenge him after he had entered the premises, before he had chosen June Anne as his victim.\n\nGriffiths refused to talk in much detail as to the atrocities he inflicted upon the child, beyond claiming that he had killed June Anne in a fit of rage when she had begun crying after he had carried her from the premises. Nonetheless, in one section of his statement, Griffiths stated that as he had carried the child across the field to where he assaulted and murdered her, June Anne had trustingly placed her arms around his neck. Although he showed no remorse for his actions (which he blamed upon his state of intoxication) throughout the course of his confession, he did end his formal statement with a sentence indicating he wished to be hanged for his crime: \"I hope I get what I deserve.\"\n\nOn the evening of 13 August, Peter Griffiths was formally charged with the murder of June Anne Devaney. Beyond providing investigators with a further set of his fingerprints and foot impressions for additional comparison with those upon the Winchester bottle and upon the floor of the ward of the Queen's Park Hospital, he would refuse to cooperate with all subsequent requests either to discuss aspects of his crime, or to provide blood or pubic hair samples for additional comparison with samples obtained at the crime scene prior to his upcoming trial; simply making statements to the effect of, \"I don't wish to say anything\" when these requests were made.\n\nFollowing Griffiths' confession, he was immediately remanded into custody at Walton Gaol to await trial.\n\nTo both substantiate Griffiths' confession, and to garner further evidence, investigators went to his house to conduct a thorough search. During this search, a ticket was found from a local pawnbroker, dated 31 May 1948, for a suit belonging to Griffiths. Police collected this suit, only for the police forensics laboratory to discover that it bore bloodstains in several locations on both the jacket and trousers. These bloodstains were found to be the same blood type of June Anne Devaney—type A. Furthermore, fibres from this suit proved to be a perfect match to fibres found upon the child's body, clothing, and the window ledge where her murderer had entered the hospital, thus proving this to have been the suit Griffiths had been wearing on the night of the crime.\n\nThe trial of Peter Griffiths began on 15 October 1948. He was tried before Mr. Justice Oliver at the assize court of Lancaster, and chose to enter a formal plea of not guilty to the charge of murder on this date.\n\nAmong those to testify on behalf of the prosecution was Inspector Colin Campbell, who testified as to the prints on the Winchester bottle being a precise match for the samples Griffiths had twice provided for investigators, and which he readily acknowledged were his own. To demonstrate this, enlarged copies of both sets of fingerprints were displayed to the jury, with Inspector Campbell indicating 16 ridge characteristics which were in agreement on both sets of impressions. Inspector Campbell also testified as to the stockinged feet impressions Griffiths had provided for investigators also being remarkably similar in characteristics with those found upon the ward from which June Anne had been abducted. Also to testify on behalf of the prosecution were individuals who described how the suit Griffiths had pawned shortly after the murder was found to be heavily bloodstained in several locations on both the jacket and trousers, and that these bloodstains were of the same blood type of June Anne Devaney. The jurors were told how fibres from this suit were of a perfect match to fibres found on the child's clothing, body, and on the window ledge where her murderer had evidently entered the hospital. None of these experts were cross-examined by Griffiths' defence counsel.\n\nDuring the trial, Griffiths' defence counsel openly stated they were not fighting for his freedom, but for his life (murder being a capital offence in the United Kingdom at the time). As Griffiths had already pleaded guilty to the offence, all that remained was a question of his sanity, and as such, the defence had entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. This opinion was voiced by Dr. Alaistair Robertson Grant, who stated for the defence that Griffiths was displaying the early signs of schizophrenia (a condition for which he had treated Griffiths' father some thirty years previously when he had been hospitalised with the condition). Dr. Grant stated to the jury that although Griffiths knew what he was doing, he did not realise the criminality of his actions. To refute this testimony, the prosecution produced the medical officer from Walton Gaol, a Dr. F.H. Brisby. Dr. Brisby testified on 18 October as to his observations of Griffiths while he had been held on remand since 14 August. He stated that, based on his observations of Griffiths throughout his incarceration, Griffiths was sane when he had committed the crime.\n\nDuring the trial, Griffiths described how he had entered the hospital while intoxicated, and had then picked up the Winchester sterile water bottle, which he stated to the Court he had intended to use as a weapon if he was challenged. He also described how he had lifted June Anne Devaney from her cot and then carried her, in his right arm, out of the hospital, down the field to where he had proceeded to beat and rape her, adding that the child had trustingly placed her arms around his neck as he had carried her to this destination. Although he confessed to having swung the child's head into the boundary wall approximately four times, Griffiths made no response when he was specifically asked about the sexual aspect of the assault. (After hearing Griffiths' recollection of the events, Dr. Alaistair Grant privately conceded that Griffiths was of sound mind.)\n\nThe trial lasted for two days. Following closing arguments delivered by both counsels, the jury retired to consider their verdict, although they would deliberate for just 23 minutes before announcing they had reached their verdict. Peter Griffiths was found guilty of June Anne Devaney's murder. In response to this verdict, Mr. Justice Oliver donned his formal black cap and made the following speech:\n\nPeter Griffiths did not lodge an appeal against his conviction. He was hanged at Liverpool Prison on 19 November 1948. His body was later buried within the confines of the prison.\n\n\n\n\n"}

As a consequence, such narratives escape the constraints of centralized authorship, distribution, and storytelling. One of the most visible forms of networked narrative has been the alternate reality game, an interactive scenario that is experienced through multiple channels and adapts to player behavior. Additionally, networked narratives have been represented in films such as Crash and Syriana through highly decentralized, threaded plots.\n\nMarco Deseriis breaks down networked narratives in three central functions: denotative, performing, and pragmatic. He claims that socially-created networked narratives:\n\n1. Represent an initially unsolved conflict, dilemma, or other situation.<br>\n2. Invite viewers to perform a role in the story.<br>\n3. Are oriented around a system of beliefs or ethics that resonating with participants and allows them to create new stories.\n\nInternet activism, hacktivism, and the free software movement are principal examples of such narratives in practice.

The best example of this concept can be found in Nietzsche's \"The Will to Power\":\n\nWalter Kaufmann wrote that Nietzsche \"celebrates the Greeks who, facing up to the terrors of nature and history, did not seek refuge in \"a Buddhistic negation of the will,\" as Schopenhauer did, but instead created tragedies in which life is affirmed as beautiful in spite of everything.\" Schopenhauer’s negation of the will was a saying \"no\" to life and to the world, which he judged to be a scene of pain and evil. \"[D]irectly against Schopenhauer’s place as the ultimate nay-sayer to life, Nietzsche positioned himself as the ultimate yes-sayer….\" Nietzsche’s affirmation of life's pain and evil, in opposition to Schopenhauer, resulted from an overflow of life. Schopenhauer’s advocacy of self-denial and negation of life was, according to Nietzsche, very harmful. For his entire mature life, Nietzsche was concerned with the damage that he thought resulted from Schopenhauerian disgust with life and turning against the world.\n\nJacques Derrida allocates this concept and applies it specifically to language, its structure and play. This application acknowledges that there is, in fact, no center or origin within language and its many parts, no firm ground from which to base any Truth or truths. This shock allows for two reactions in Derrida’s philosophy: the more negative, melancholic response, which he designates as Rousseauistic, or the more positive Nietzschean affirmation. Rousseau's perspective focuses on deciphering the truth and origin of language and its many signs, an often exhaustive occupation. Derrida's response to Nietzsche, however, offers an active participation with these signs and arrives at, in Derridean philosophy, a more resolute response to language.\n\nIn \"Structure, Sign, and Play\", Derrida articulates Nietzsche’s perspective as:\n... the joyous affirmation of the play of the world and of the innocence of becoming, the affirmation of a world of signs without fault, without truth, and without origin which is offered to an active interpretation.\n\nEssentially, Derrida not only fosters Nietzsche’s work but evolves it within the sphere of language; in doing so, Derrida acquires and employs Nietzsche’s optimism in his concept of play: \"the \"substitution\" of \"given\" and \"existing\", \"present\", pieces\" (292). Much of this spirit resides in the abandonment of any sort of new humanism. This acceptance of the inevitable allows for considerable relief—evident in the designation of the loss of center as a non-center—as well as the opportunity to affirm and cultivate play, which enables humanity and the humanities \"to pass beyond man and humanism\" (292).\n\n"}

Board of Education\", a landmark Supreme Court decision against segregation in public schools. The event organizers urged the government to abide by that decision, as the process of desegregation was being obstructed at local and state levels.\n\nThe march was organized by A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and Ella Baker. It was supported by the NAACP and the recently founded Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. had asked the planners not to embarrass the Eisenhower administration, thus the event was organized as a prayer commemoration. A call for the demonstration was issued on April 5, 1957, by Randolph, Martin Luther King Jr., and Roy Wilkins.\n\nThe three-hour demonstration took place in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Mahalia Jackson and Harry Belafonte participated in the event. Paul Robeson and his wife Eslanda attended, but were largely ignored. Among the speakers were Wilkins, Mordecai Johnson, and King. King was the last speaker and it was the first time that he addressed a national audience. It was his first Lincoln Memorial speech and it set the goal and agenda for voting rights as an important part of the civil rights struggle against a reluctant administration. About 25,000 demonstrators attended the event to pray and voice their opinion. At the time, the event was the largest demonstration ever organized for civil rights.\n\nKing's oratory at the event is named the \"Give Us the Ballot\" speech, as its key section uses this demand as a litany, followed by a listing of changes that would result by African Americans regaining voting rights: \n\nIt is one of King's major speeches.\n\nWith his oratory King established himself as the \"No. 1 leader of 16 million Negroes\" (James L. Hicks, \"Amsterdam News\"). His call for the ballot eventually helped inspire such events as the Selma Voting Rights Movement, its related Selma to Montgomery March, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The organizers gained experience and the march laid the foundation for further larger Civil Rights Movement demonstrations in Washington.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23474", "title": "Problem of universals", "text": "Problem of universals\n\nIn metaphysics, the problem of universals refers to the question of whether properties exist, and if so, what they are. Properties are qualities or relations that two or more entities have in common. The various kinds of properties, such as qualities and relations, are referred to as universals. For instance, one can imagine three cup holders on a table that have in common the quality of \"being circular\" or \"exemplifying circularity\", or two daughters that have in common \"being the female offsprings of Frank.\" There are many such properties, such as being human, red, male or female, liquid, big or small, taller than, father of, etc.\n\nWhile philosophers agree that human beings talk and think about properties, they disagree on whether these universals exist in reality or merely in thought and speech.\n\nThere are many philosophical positions regarding universals. Taking \"beauty\" as example, three positions are:\n\nExtreme realism and strong realism are also known as exaggerated realism and moderate realism respectively. A notable variant of anti-realism is nominalism.\n\nThe realist school claims that universals are real—they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them. There are various forms of realism. Two major forms are Platonic realism (\"universalia ante res\") and Aristotelian realism (\"universalia in rebus\"). \"Platonic realism\" is the view that universals are real entities existing independent of particulars. \"Aristotelian realism\", on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.\n\nRealists tend to argue that universals must be posited as distinct entities in order to account for various phenomena. For example, a common realist argument, supposedly found in Plato, is that universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false. Take the sentence \"Djivan Gasparyan is a musician\". The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual, Djivan Gasparyan, who possesses a certain quality: musicianship. Thus it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property.\n\nNominalists assert that only individuals or particulars exist and deny that universals are real (i.e. that they exist as entities or beings; \"universalia post res\"). The term \"nominalism\" comes from the Latin \"nomen\" (\"name\"), since the nominalist philosopher agrees that we predicate the same property of multiple entities but argues that the entities only share a name, not a real quality, in common. There are various forms of nominalism; four major varieties are predicate nominalism, resemblance nominalism, trope nominalism, and conceptualism. \n\nNominalists often argue for their view by claiming that nominalism can account for all the relevant phenomena, and therefore—by Occam's razor or some sort of principle of simplicity—nominalism is preferable, since it posits fewer entities.\n\nNominalism has been endorsed or defended by many, including Chrysippus, William of Ockham, Rudolf Carnap, Nelson Goodman, David Lewis, H. H. Price, and D. C. Williams.\n\nTranscendental idealist philosopher Immanuel Kant posited that universals are not real, but are ideas in the mind of rational beings. Transcendental idealists do not reject universals as arbitrary names; rather, they treat universals as fundamental categories of pure reason (or as secondary concepts derived from those fundamental categories). Universals, in transcendental idealism, are intrinsically tied to the rationality of the subject making the judgment.\n\nThus, for transcendental idealists, the problem of universals is only tangentially a metaphysical problem; it is more of a problem of psychology and epistemology. Kant's position has been interpreted as a conceptualist one.\n\nPlato believed there to be a sharp distinction between the world of perceivable objects and the world of universals or forms: one can only have mere opinions about the former, but one can have knowledge about the latter. For Plato it was not possible to have knowledge of anything that could change or was particular, since knowledge had to be forever unfailing and general. For that reason, the world of the forms is the real world, like sunlight, while the sensible world is only imperfectly or partially real, like shadows. This Platonic realism, however, in denying that the eternal Forms are mental artifacts, differs sharply with modern forms of idealism.\n\nOne of the first nominalist critiques of Plato's realism was that of Diogenes of Sinope, who said \"I've seen Plato's cups and table, but not his cupness and tableness.\"\n\nPlato's student Aristotle disagreed with his tutor. Aristotle transformed Plato's forms into \"formal causes\", the blueprints or essences of individual things. Whereas Plato idealized geometry, Aristotle emphasized nature and related disciplines and therefore much of his thinking concerns living beings and their properties. The nature of universals in Aristotle's philosophy therefore hinges on his view of natural kinds.\n\nConsider for example a particular oak tree. This is a member of a species and it has much in common with other oak trees, past, present and future. Its universal, its oakness, is a part of it. A biologist can study oak trees and learn about oakness and more generally the intelligible order within the sensible world. Accordingly, Aristotle was more confident than Plato about coming to know the sensible world; he was a prototypical empiricist and a founder of induction. Aristotle was a new, moderate sort of realist about universals.\n\nThe problem was introduced to the medieval world by Boethius, by his translation of Porphyry's Isagoge. It begins:\n\n\"I shall omit to speak about genera and species, as to whether they subsist (in the nature of things) or in mere conceptions only; whether also if subsistent, they are bodies or incorporeal, and whether they are separate from, or in, sensibles, and subsist about these, for such a treatise is most profound, and requires another more extensive investigation\".\n\nDuns Scotus argued strongly against both nominalism and conceptualism, arguing instead for Scotist realism, a medieval response to the conceptualism of Abelard.\n\nWilliam of Ockham argued strongly that universals are a product of abstract human thought. According to Ockham, universals are just words/names that only exist in the mind and have no real place in the external world.\n\nRealism was argued for by both Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus. Aquinas argued that both the essence of a thing and its existence were clearly distinct; in this regard he is close to the teaching of Aristotle. Scotist realism argues that in a thing there is no real distinction between the essence and the existence, instead there is only a Formal distinction. Both of these opinions were denied by Scotus' pupil William of Ockham.\n\nIn medieval philosophy, the French philosopher and theologian Roscellinus (c. 1050 – c. 1125) was an early, prominent proponent of nominalism.\n\nThe 19th-century British philosophy John Stuart Mill discussed the problem of universals in the course of a book that eviscerated the philosophy of Sir William Hamilton. Mill wrote, \"The formation of a concept does not consist in separating the attributes which are said to compose it from all other attributes of the same object and enabling us to conceive those attributes, disjoined from any others. We neither conceive them, nor think them, nor cognize them in any way, as a thing apart, but solely as forming, in combination with numerous other attributes, the idea of an individual object\".\n\nHowever, he then proceeds to state that Berkeley's position is factually wrong by stating the following:\n\nIn other words, we may be \"temporarily unconscious\" of whether an image is white, black or yellow and concentrate our attention on the fact that it is a man and on just those attributes necessary to identify it as a man (but not as any particular one). It may then have the significance of a universal of manhood.\n\nThe 19th-century American logician Charles Sanders Peirce, known as the father of pragmatism, developed his own views on the problem of universals in the course of a review of an edition of the writings of George Berkeley. Peirce begins with the observation that \"Berkeley's metaphysical theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop\". He includes among these paradoxical doctrines Berkeley's denial of \"the possibility of forming the simplest general conception\". He wrote that if there is some mental fact that works \"in practice\" the way that a universal would, that fact is a universal. \"If I have learned a formula in gibberish which in any way jogs my memory so as to enable me in each single case to act as though I had a general idea, what possible utility is there in distinguishing between such a gibberish... and an idea?\" Peirce also held as a matter of ontology that what he called \"thirdness\", the more general facts about the world, are extra-mental realities.\n\nWilliam James learned pragmatism, this way of understanding an idea by its practical effects, from his friend Peirce, but he gave it new significance. (Which was not to Peirce's taste - he came to complain that James had \"kidnapped\" the term and eventually to call himself a \"pragmaticist\" instead.) Although James certainly agreed with Peirce and against Berkeley that general ideas exist as a psychological fact, he was a nominalist in his ontology:\n\nThere are at least three ways in which a realist might try to answer James' challenge of explaining the reason why universal conceptions are more lofty than those of particulars: the moral/political answer, the mathematical/scientific answer, and the anti-paradoxical answer. Each has contemporary or near-contemporary advocates.\n\nThe moral or political response is given by the conservative philosopher Richard M. Weaver in \"Ideas Have Consequences\" (1948), where he describes how the acceptance of \"the fateful doctrine of nominalism\" was \"the crucial event in the history of Western culture; from this flowed those acts which issue now in modern decadence\".\n\nNino Cocchiarella put forward the idea that realism is the best response to certain logical paradoxes to which nominalism leads (\"Nominalism and Conceptualism as Predicative Second Order Theories of Predication\", \"Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic\", vol. 21 (1980)). It is noted that in a sense Cocchiarella has adopted Platonism for anti-Platonic reasons. Plato, as seen in the dialogue \"Parmenides\", was willing to accept a certain amount of paradox with his forms. Cocchiarella adopts the forms to avoid paradox.\n\nThe Australian philosopher David Malet Armstrong has been one of the leading realists in the twentieth century, and has used a concept of universals to build a naturalistic and scientifically realist ontology. In both \"Universals and Scientific Realism\" (1978) and \"Universals: An Opinionated Introduction\" (1989), Armstrong describes the relative merits of a number of nominalist theories which appeal either to \"natural classes\" (a view he ascribes to Anthony Quinton), concepts, resemblance relations or predicates, and also discusses non-realist \"trope\" accounts (which he describes in the \"Universals and Scientific Realism\" volumes as \"particularism\"). He gives a number of reasons to reject all of these, but also dismisses a number of realist accounts.\n\nRoger Penrose contends that the foundations of mathematics can't be understood absent the Platonic view that \"mathematical truth is absolute, external and eternal, and not based on man-made criteria ... mathematical objects have a timeless existence of their own...\"\n\n\n\n"}

A theory of pseudogroups was developed by Élie Cartan in the early 1900s.\n\nIt is not an axiomatic algebraic idea; rather it defines a set of closure conditions on sets of homeomorphisms defined on open sets \"U\" of a given Euclidean space \"E\" or more generally of a fixed topological space \"S\". The groupoid condition on those is fulfilled, in that homeomorphisms\n\nand\n\ncompose to a \"homeomorphism\" from \"U\" to \"W\". The further requirement on a pseudogroup is related to the possibility of \"patching\" (in the sense of descent, transition functions, or a gluing axiom).\n\nSpecifically, a pseudogroup on a topological space \"S\" is a collection \"Γ\" of homeomorphisms between open subsets of \"S\" satisfying the following properties.\n\nAn example in space of two dimensions is the pseudogroup of invertible holomorphic functions of a complex variable (invertible in the sense of having an inverse function). The properties of this pseudogroup are what makes it possible to define Riemann surfaces by local data patched together.\n\nIn general, pseudogroups were studied as a possible theory of infinite-dimensional Lie groups. The concept of a local Lie group, namely a pseudogroup of functions defined in neighbourhoods of the origin of \"E\", is actually closer to Lie's original concept of Lie group, in the case where the transformations involved depend on a finite number of parameters, than the contemporary definition via manifolds. One of Cartan's achievements was to clarify the points involved, including the point that a local Lie group always gives rise to a \"global\" group, in the current sense (an analogue of Lie's third theorem, on Lie algebras determining a group). The formal group is yet another approach to the specification of Lie groups, infinitesimally. It is known, however, that \"local topological groups\" do not necessarily have global counterparts.\n\nExamples of infinite-dimensional pseudogroups abound, beginning with the pseudogroup of all diffeomorphisms of \"E\". The interest is mainly in sub-pseudogroups of the diffeomorphisms, and therefore with objects that have a Lie algebra analogue of vector fields. Methods proposed by Lie and by Cartan for studying these objects have become more practical given the progress of computer algebra.\n\nIn the 1950s Cartan's theory was reformulated by Shiing-Shen Chern, and a general deformation theory for pseudogroups was developed by Kunihiko Kodaira and D. C. Spencer. In the 1960s homological algebra was applied to the basic PDE questions involved, of over-determination; this though revealed that the algebra of the theory is potentially very heavy. In the same decade the interest for theoretical physics of infinite-dimensional Lie theory appeared for the first time, in the shape of current algebra.\n"}

A common scenario is where the two individuals function in close proximity, such as co-workers or in a group of friends, but do not have sex to avoid awkwardness or for other reasons. Sexual tension doesn't have anything to do with the actual act of sex but is everything that leads up to it.\n\nSexual tension can also occur when two individuals have previously had sexual relations and still feel an attraction towards each other, but do not wish to have sex again for fear of its effect on their current social situation (such as maintaining a relationship with a different partner). It can also be felt in situations when two individuals have a relationship devoid of physical contact, as in a long-distance relationship.\n\nSexual tension often occurs between individuals when the relationship is close and often flirtatious, yet the two people involved adamantly deny their feelings for each other. Meanwhile, it can appear extremely obvious to other friends or co-workers that such tension is present between the two individuals. When people give in to sexual tension, the relationship can become complicated and awkward if no new relationship level is established, as the relationship that existed before is no longer valid.\n\nSexual tension is a common feature in works of fiction. This longing is often suggested by incidents of intimacy; for example, when two characters are alone and in close proximity (or actually touching), yet desire is never explicitly expressed. Another common theme is for characters to develop an interest in each other over the course of the story, and if this is expertly done, the audience can become aware of the growing attraction.\n\nSexual tension intensifies the audience's involvement with all characters involved. However, as several television series have discovered to their sorrow, tension dissipates when characters come together in sexual harmony. It is not like violence, which establishes the villain's credibility and makes the next round of jeopardy even more powerful. Instead, sexual fulfillment has the same effect on sexual tension that the death of the victim has on jeopardy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34327569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34327569", "title": "Social network", "text": "Social network\n\nA social network is a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of dyadic ties, and other social interactions between actors. The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures. The study of these structures uses social network analysis to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.\n\nSocial networks and the analysis of them is an inherently interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from social psychology, sociology, statistics, and graph theory. Georg Simmel authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and \"web of group affiliations\". Jacob Moreno is credited with developing the first sociograms in the 1930s to study interpersonal relationships. These approaches were mathematically formalized in the 1950s and theories and methods of social networks became pervasive in the social and behavioral sciences by the 1980s. Social network analysis is now one of the major paradigms in contemporary sociology, and is also employed in a number of other social and formal sciences. Together with other complex networks, it forms part of the nascent field of network science.\n\nThe social network is a theoretical construct useful in the social sciences to study relationships between individuals, groups, organizations, or even entire societies (social units, see differentiation). The term is used to describe a social structure determined by such interactions. The ties through which any given social unit connects represent the convergence of the various social contacts of that unit. This theoretical approach is, necessarily, relational. An axiom of the social network approach to understanding social interaction is that social phenomena should be primarily conceived and investigated through the properties of relations between and within units, instead of the properties of these units themselves. Thus, one common criticism of social network theory is that individual agency is often ignored although this may not be the case in practice (see agent-based modeling). Precisely because many different types of relations, singular or in combination, form these network configurations, network analytics are useful to a broad range of research enterprises. In social science, these fields of study include, but are not limited to anthropology, biology, communication studies, economics, geography, information science, organizational studies, social psychology, sociology, and sociolinguistics.\n\nIn the late 1890s, both Émile Durkheim and Ferdinand Tönnies foreshadowed the idea of social networks in their theories and research of social groups. Tönnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (\"Gemeinschaft\", German, commonly translated as \"community\") or impersonal, formal, and instrumental social links (\"Gesellschaft\", German, commonly translated as \"society\"). Durkheim gave a non-individualistic explanation of social facts, arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that can no longer be accounted for in terms of the properties of individual actors. Georg Simmel, writing at the turn of the twentieth century, pointed to the nature of networks and the effect of network size on interaction and examined the likelihood of interaction in loosely knit networks rather than groups.\nMajor developments in the field can be seen in the 1930s by several groups in psychology, anthropology, and mathematics working independently. In psychology, in the 1930s, Jacob L. Moreno began systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups, especially classrooms and work groups (see sociometry). In anthropology, the foundation for social network theory is the theoretical and ethnographic work of Bronislaw Malinowski, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, and Claude Lévi-Strauss. A group of social anthropologists associated with Max Gluckman and the Manchester School, including John A. Barnes, J. Clyde Mitchell and Elizabeth Bott Spillius, often are credited with performing some of the first fieldwork from which network analyses were performed, investigating community networks in southern Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Concomitantly, British anthropologist S. F. Nadel codified a theory of social structure that was influential in later network analysis. In sociology, the early (1930s) work of Talcott Parsons set the stage for taking a relational approach to understanding social structure. Later, drawing upon Parsons' theory, the work of sociologist Peter Blau provides a strong impetus for analyzing the relational ties of social units with his work on social exchange theory.\n\nBy the 1970s, a growing number of scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions. One group consisted of sociologist Harrison White and his students at the Harvard University Department of Social Relations. Also independently active in the Harvard Social Relations department at the time were Charles Tilly, who focused on networks in political and community sociology and social movements, and Stanley Milgram, who developed the \"six degrees of separation\" thesis. Mark Granovetter and Barry Wellman are among the former students of White who elaborated and championed the analysis of social networks.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, social network analysis experienced work by sociologists, political scientists, and physicists such as Duncan J. Watts, Albert-László Barabási, Peter Bearman, Nicholas A. Christakis, James H. Fowler, and others, developing and applying new models and methods to emerging data available about online social networks, as well as \"digital traces\" regarding face-to-face networks.\n\nIn general, social networks are self-organizing, emergent, and complex, such that a globally coherent pattern appears from the local interaction of the elements that make up the system. These patterns become more apparent as network size increases. However, a global network analysis of, for example, all interpersonal relationships in the world is not feasible and is likely to contain so much information as to be uninformative. Practical limitations of computing power, ethics and participant recruitment and payment also limit the scope of a social network analysis. The nuances of a local system may be lost in a large network analysis, hence the quality of information may be more important than its scale for understanding network properties. Thus, social networks are analyzed at the scale relevant to the researcher's theoretical question. Although levels of analysis are not necessarily mutually exclusive, there are three general levels into which networks may fall: micro-level, meso-level, and macro-level.\n\nAt the micro-level, social network research typically begins with an individual, snowballing as social relationships are traced, or may begin with a small group of individuals in a particular social context.\n\nDyadic level: A dyad is a social relationship between two individuals. Network research on dyads may concentrate on structure of the relationship (e.g. multiplexity, strength), social equality, and tendencies toward reciprocity/mutuality.\n\nTriadic level: Add one individual to a dyad, and you have a triad. Research at this level may concentrate on factors such as balance and transitivity, as well as social equality and tendencies toward reciprocity/mutuality. In the balance theory of Fritz Heider the triad is the key to social dynamics. The discord in a rivalrous love triangle is an example of an unbalanced triad, likely to change to a balanced triad by a change in one of the relations. The dynamics of social friendships in society has been modeled by balancing triads. The study is carried forward with the theory of signed graphs.\n\nActor level: The smallest unit of analysis in a social network is an individual in their social setting, i.e., an \"actor\" or \"ego\". Egonetwork analysis focuses on network characteristics such as size, relationship strength, density, centrality, prestige and roles such as isolates, liaisons, and bridges. Such analyses, are most commonly used in the fields of psychology or social psychology, ethnographic kinship analysis or other genealogical studies of relationships between individuals.\n\nSubset level: Subset levels of network research problems begin at the micro-level, but may cross over into the meso-level of analysis. Subset level research may focus on distance and reachability, cliques, cohesive subgroups, or other group actions or behavior.\n\nIn general, meso-level theories begin with a population size that falls between the micro- and macro-levels. However, meso-level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro- and macro-levels. Meso-level networks are low density and may exhibit causal processes distinct from interpersonal micro-level networks.\n\nOrganizations: Formal organizations are social groups that distribute tasks for a collective goal. Network research on organizations may focus on either intra-organizational or inter-organizational ties in terms of formal or informal relationships. Intra-organizational networks themselves often contain multiple levels of analysis, especially in larger organizations with multiple branches, franchises or semi-autonomous departments. In these cases, research is often conducted at a workgroup level and organization level, focusing on the interplay between the two structures. Experiments with networked groups online have documented ways to optimize group-level coordination through diverse interventions, including the addition of autonomous agents to the groups.\n\nRandomly distributed networks: Exponential random graph models of social networks became state-of-the-art methods of social network analysis in the 1980s. This framework has the capacity to represent social-structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks, including general degree-based structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks as well as reciprocity and transitivity, and at the node-level, homophily and attribute-based activity and popularity effects, as derived from explicit hypotheses about dependencies among network ties. Parameters are given in terms of the prevalence of small subgraph configurations in the network and can be interpreted as describing the combinations of local social processes from which a given network emerges. These probability models for networks on a given set of actors allow generalization beyond the restrictive dyadic independence assumption of micro-networks, allowing models to be built from theoretical structural foundations of social behavior.\n\nScale-free networks: A scale-free network is a network whose degree distribution follows a power law, at least asymptotically. In network theory a scale-free ideal network is a random network with a degree distribution that unravels the size distribution of social groups. Specific characteristics of scale-free networks vary with the theories and analytical tools used to create them, however, in general, scale-free networks have some common characteristics. One notable characteristic in a scale-free network is the relative commonness of vertices with a degree that greatly exceeds the average. The highest-degree nodes are often called \"hubs\", and may serve specific purposes in their networks, although this depends greatly on the social context. Another general characteristic of scale-free networks is the clustering coefficient distribution, which decreases as the node degree increases. This distribution also follows a power law. The Barabási model of network evolution shown above is an example of a scale-free network.\n\nRather than tracing interpersonal interactions, macro-level analyses generally trace the outcomes of interactions, such as economic or other resource transfer interactions over a large population.\n\nLarge-scale networks: Large-scale network is a term somewhat synonymous with \"macro-level\" as used, primarily, in social and behavioral sciences, in economics. Originally, the term was used extensively in the computer sciences (see large-scale network mapping).\n\nComplex networks: Most larger social networks display features of social complexity, which involves substantial non-trivial features of network topology, with patterns of complex connections between elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random (see, complexity science, dynamical system and chaos theory), as do biological, and technological networks. Such complex network features include a heavy tail in the degree distribution, a high clustering coefficient, assortativity or disassortativity among vertices, community structure (see stochastic block model), and hierarchical structure. In the case of agency-directed networks these features also include reciprocity, triad significance profile (TSP, see network motif), and other features. In contrast, many of the mathematical models of networks that have been studied in the past, such as lattices and random graphs, do not show these features.\n\nVarious theoretical frameworks have been imported for the use of social network analysis. The most prominent of these are Graph theory, Balance theory, Social comparison theory, and more recently, the Social identity approach.\n\nFew complete theories have been produced from social network analysis. Two that have are Structural Role Theory and Heterophily Theory.\n\nThe basis of Heterophily Theory was the finding in one study that more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation, as cliques have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as well as share many common traits. This homophilic tendency was the reason for the members of the cliques to be attracted together in the first place. However, being similar, each member of the clique would also know more or less what the other members knew. To find new information or insights, members of the clique will have to look beyond the clique to its other friends and acquaintances. This is what Granovetter called \"the strength of weak ties\".\n\nIn the context of networks, social capital exists where people have an advantage because of their location in a network. Contacts in a network provide information, opportunities and perspectives that can be beneficial to the central player in the network. Most social structures tend to be characterized by dense clusters of strong connections. Information within these clusters tends to be rather homogeneous and redundant. Non-redundant information is most often obtained through contacts in different clusters. When two separate clusters possess non-redundant information, there is said to be a structural hole between them. Thus, a network that bridges structural holes will provide network benefits that are in some degree additive, rather than overlapping. An ideal network structure has a vine and cluster structure, providing access to many different clusters and structural holes.\n\nNetworks rich in structural holes are a form of social capital in that they offer information benefits. The main player in a network that bridges structural holes is able to access information from diverse sources and clusters. For example, in business networks, this is beneficial to an individual's career because he is more likely to hear of job openings and opportunities if his network spans a wide range of contacts in different industries/sectors. This concept is similar to Mark Granovetter's theory of weak ties, which rests on the basis that having a broad range of contacts is most effective for job attainment.\n\nCommunication Studies are often considered a part of both the social sciences and the humanities, drawing heavily on fields such as sociology, psychology, anthropology, information science, biology, political science, and economics as well as rhetoric, literary studies, and semiotics. Many communication concepts describe the transfer of information from one source to another, and can thus be conceived of in terms of a network.\n\nIn J.A. Barnes' day, a \"community\" referred to a specific geographic location and studies of community ties had to do with who talked, associated, traded, and attended church with whom. Today, however, there are extended \"online\" communities developed through telecommunications devices and social network services. Such devices and services require extensive and ongoing maintenance and analysis, often using network science methods. Community development studies, today, also make extensive use of such methods.\n\nComplex networks require methods specific to modelling and interpreting social complexity and complex adaptive systems, including techniques of dynamic network analysis.\nMechanisms such as Dual-phase evolution explain how temporal changes in connectivity contribute to the formation of structure in social networks.\n\nIn criminology and urban sociology, much attention has been paid to the social networks among criminal actors. For example, Andrew Papachristos has studied gang murders as a series of exchanges between gangs. Murders can be seen to diffuse outwards from a single source, because weaker gangs cannot afford to kill members of stronger gangs in retaliation, but must commit other violent acts to maintain their reputation for strength.\n\nDiffusion of ideas and innovations studies focus on the spread and use of ideas from one actor to another or one culture and another. This line of research seeks to explain why some become \"early adopters\" of ideas and innovations, and links social network structure with facilitating or impeding the spread of an innovation.\n\nIn demography, the study of social networks has led to new sampling methods for estimating and reaching populations that are hard to enumerate (for example, homeless people or intravenous drug users.) For example, respondent driven sampling is a network-based sampling technique that relies on respondents to a survey recommending further respondents.\n\nThe field of sociology focuses almost entirely on networks of outcomes of social interactions. More narrowly, economic sociology considers behavioral interactions of individuals and groups through social capital and social \"markets\". Sociologists, such as Mark Granovetter, have developed core principles about the interactions of social structure, information, ability to punish or reward, and trust that frequently recur in their analyses of political, economic and other institutions. Granovetter examines how social structures and social networks can affect economic outcomes like hiring, price, productivity and innovation and describes sociologists' contributions to analyzing the impact of social structure and networks on the economy.\n\nAnalysis of social networks is increasingly incorporated into health care analytics, not only in epidemiological studies but also in models of patient communication and education, disease prevention, mental health diagnosis and treatment, and in the study of health care organizations and systems.\n\nHuman ecology is an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. The scientific philosophy of human ecology has a diffuse history with connections to geography, sociology, psychology, anthropology, zoology, and natural ecology.\n\nStudies of language and linguistics, particularly evolutionary linguistics, focus on the development of linguistic forms and transfer of changes, sounds or words, from one language system to another through networks of social interaction. Social networks are also important in language shift, as groups of people add and/or abandon languages to their repertoire.\n\nIn the study of literary systems, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo, De Nooy, and Senekal, to study various aspects of how literature functions. The basic premise is that polysystem theory, which has been around since the writings of Even-Zohar, can be integrated with network theory and the relationships between different actors in the literary network, e.g. writers, critics, publishers, literary histories, etc., can be mapped using visualization from SNA.\n\nResearch studies of formal or informal organization relationships, organizational communication, economics, economic sociology, and other resource transfers. Social networks have also been used to examine how organizations interact with each other, characterizing the many informal connections that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different organizations. Intra-organizational networks have been found to affect organizational commitment, organizational identification, interpersonal citizenship behaviour.\n\nSocial capital is a form of economic and cultural capital in which social networks are central, transactions are marked by reciprocity, trust, and cooperation, and market agents produce goods and services not mainly for themselves, but for a common good.\n\nSocial capital is a sociological concept about the value of social relations and the role of cooperation and confidence to achieve positive outcomes. The term refers to the value one can get from their social ties. For example, newly arrived immigrants can make use of their social ties to established migrants to acquire jobs they may otherwise have trouble getting (e.g., because of unfamiliarity with the local language). A positive relationship exists between social capital and the intensity of social network use. In a dynamic framework, higher activity in a network feeds into higher social capital which itself encourages more activity.\n\nIn many organizations, members tend to focus their activities inside their own groups, which stifles creativity and restricts opportunities. A player whose network bridges structural holes has an advantage in detecting and developing rewarding opportunities. Such a player can mobilize social capital by acting as a \"broker\" of information between two clusters that otherwise would not have been in contact, thus providing access to new ideas, opinions and opportunities. British philosopher and political economist John Stuart Mill, writes, \"it is hardly possible to overrate the value ... of placing human beings in contact with persons dissimilar to themselves... Such communication [is] one of the primary sources of progress.\" Thus, a player with a network rich in structural holes can add value to an organization through new ideas and opportunities. This in turn, helps an individual's career development and advancement.\n\nA social capital broker also reaps control benefits of being the facilitator of information flow between contacts. In the case of consulting firm Eden McCallum, the founders were able to advance their careers by bridging their connections with former big three consulting firm consultants and mid-size industry firms. By bridging structural holes and mobilizing social capital, players can advance their careers by executing new opportunities between contacts.\n\nThere has been research that both substantiates and refutes the benefits of information brokerage. A study of high tech Chinese firms by Zhixing Xiao found that the control benefits of structural holes are \"dissonant to the dominant firm-wide spirit of cooperation and the information benefits cannot materialize due to the communal sharing values\" of such organizations. However, this study only analyzed Chinese firms, which tend to have strong communal sharing values. Information and control benefits of structural holes are still valuable in firms that are not quite as inclusive and cooperative on the firm-wide level. In 2004, Ronald Burt studied 673 managers who ran the supply chain for one of America's largest electronics companies. He found that managers who often discussed issues with other groups were better paid, received more positive job evaluations and were more likely to be promoted. Thus, bridging structural holes can be beneficial to an organization, and in turn, to an individual's career.\n\nComputer networks combined with social networking software produces a new medium for social interaction. A relationship over a computerized social networking service can be characterized by context, direction, and strength. The content of a relation refers to the resource that is exchanged. In a computer mediated communication context, social pairs exchange different kinds of information, including sending a data file or a computer program as well as providing emotional support or arranging a meeting. With the rise of electronic commerce, information exchanged may also correspond to exchanges of money, goods or services in the \"real\" world. Social network analysis methods have become essential to examining these types of computer mediated communication.\n\nIn addition, the sheer size and the volatile nature of social media has given rise to new network metrics. A key concern with networks extracted from social media is the lack of robustness of network metrics given missing data.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53554", "title": "Somerville College, Oxford", "text": "Somerville College, Oxford\n\nSomerville College is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England. The college has an excellent reputation and an outstanding student satisfaction among the Oxford colleges. Founded in 1879 as Somerville Hall, it was one of the first two women's colleges in Oxford, and its alumni, such as Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Dorothy Hodgkin, Iris Murdoch, Vera Brittain, Cornelia Sorabji, Dorothy L. Sayers and many activists, have played a very important role in feminism. Today, around 50% of students are male.\n\nSomerville has the second biggest college library in Oxford and is known for its friendly and liberal atmosphere, varied architecture and excellent hall food. Its liberal character traces back to its foundation by social liberals as the first non-denominational college in Oxford, deliberately unlike the strictly Anglican Lady Margaret Hall, the other women's college opened in the same year. Somerville is the only Oxford college where students may walk on the grass and in 1964, Somerville became one of the first colleges to abandon the policy of locking its gates at night to prevent students staying out late. No gowns are worn during Formal Halls.\n\nThe current principal is Janet Royall, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, who succeeded Alice Prochaska in 2017. Between 2006 and 2017, the financial endowment rose from £44.5 million to £73.4 million.\n\nThe college is located in the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter and Jericho, at the southern end of Woodstock Road, with Little Clarendon Street to the south and Walton Street to the west. It is near the Science Area, Oxford University Press, Radcliffe Observatory, and Blavatnik School of Government and between the University Parks and Port Meadow. It is located nearby the colleges Green Templeton College, Keble College and St Anne's College and the PPH St Benet's Hall.\n\nSomerville is one of only three Oxford colleges to provide on-site accommodation for all undergraduates throughout their course. The college is home to circa 600 students, of which more than a third are international. More than half of the UK students admitted to Somerville are educated at state schools, which is close to the university average.\n\nIts sister college is Girton College, Cambridge, which was, like Somerville, one of England's first residential colleges for women.\n\nIn June 1878, the \"Association for the Higher Education of Women\" was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, Master of University College, T. H. Green, a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of Balliol College, and Edward Stuart Talbot, Warden of Keble College. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \"Christ Church camp\") founded Lady Margaret Hall, which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\" This committee was called the \"Balliol camp\" and had close ties to the Liberal Party. This second committee included John Percival, George William Kitchin, A. H. D. Acland, Thomas Hill Green, Mary Ward, William Sidgwick, Henry Nettleship, Walter Pater and A. G. Vernon Harcourt.\n\nThis new effort resulted in the founding of \"Somerville Hall\", named for the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer Mary Somerville. It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody. She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.\n\nMadeleine Shaw Lefevre was chosen as the first Principal because, although not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance. Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as \"an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution.\"\n\nWhen opened, Somerville Hall had twelve students, ranging in age between 17 and 36. The first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop on Little Clarendon Street. Just two of the original 12 students admitted in 1879 remained in Oxford for three years, the period for which male students had to remain to complete a bachelor's degree.\n\nIncreasingly, however, as the college admitted more students, it became more formalized. Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges. In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of 'college' (changing its name to Somerville College), the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build a library. In Oxford legend it soon became known as the 'bluestocking college', its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the women's suffrage campaign. In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees. All female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students from the college's inception. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew. In 1925, during the principalship of Janet Vaughan, Somerville's college charter was granted.\n\nDuring World War I the college was converted into a military hospital as Somerville Section of the 3rd Southern General Hospital, adjacent to the Radcliffe Infirmary. For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to Oriel College. Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent St Mary Hall Quad which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from the Oriel's remaining male students. Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the Western Front in France.\n\nNotable patients who stayed in Somerville include Robert Graves and Siegfried Sassoon. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital. \"How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford\", Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it \"very much like Paradise\". At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie. About his time at Somerville, he wrote: \"I enjoyed my stay at Somerville. The sun shone, and the discipline was easy\". Officer Llewelyn Davies died at the college. Photographs of the college in this period can be found hanging in Hall, outside the pantry.\n\nOnce the war ended, the return to normality between Oriel College and Somerville College was delayed, sparking both frustration and an incident in spring 1919 known as the 'Oriel raid', in which male students made a hole in the wall dividing the sexes. In July 1919 the Principal (Emily Penrose) and Fellows returned to Somerville.\n\nAlumna Vera Brittain wrote about the impact of the war in Oxford and paid tribute to the work of the Principal, Miss Penrose, in her memoir \"Testament of Youth\".\n\nStarting in the 1970s, the traditionally all-male colleges in Oxford began to admit female students. Since it was assumed that recruiting from a wider demographic would guarantee better students, there was pressure on single-sex colleges to change their policy to avoid falling down the rankings. All-female colleges, like Somerville, found it increasingly difficult to attract good applicants and fell to the bottom of the intercollegiate academic rankings during the period.\n\nDuring the 1980s, there was much debate as to whether women's colleges should become mixed. Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994. Somerville became the second-last college (after St Hilda's) to become coeducational. With an intake 50% male/female; a gender balance maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.\n\nThe college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located on Woodstock Road. The front of the college runs between the Oxford Oratory and the Faculty of Philosophy. Somerville has buildings of various architectural styles, many of which bear the names of former principals of the college, located around one of Oxford's biggest quads. Five buildings are Grade II-listed.\n\nA 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of a 17th century building and earthworks beneath Somerville's site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by Royalists during the Civil War. There are also remains of some 19th century buildings, including a stone-lined well.\n\nThe original building of Somerville Hall, Walton House (commonly called 'House') was built in 1826 and purchased from St John's College in 1880 amid fears that the men's colleges might, in the future, repossess the site for their own purposes. The house could only accommodate 7 of the 12 students who came up to Oxford in the first year. In 1881, Sir Thomas Graham Jackson was commissioned to build a new south wing which could accommodate eleven more students. In 1892, Walter Cave added a north wing and an extra storey. He also installed a gatehouse at the Woodstock Road entrance. In 1897/98, the 'Eleanor Smith cottages' were built, adjoining Walton House.\n\nToday House is home to some students. It also contains Green Hall, where guests to College are often greeted and in which prospective students are registered and wait for interviews. Until 2014, it housed the college bar. Most of the administration of college and academic pigeon-hole messageboxes are located in House. A staircase from Green Hall leads up to Hall. Somerville's dining hall has a curved ceiling and wooden panelling and is one of very few in Oxford to contain portraits only of women.\n\nOriginally known as West, due to its location within the college, the project to build a second self-contained hall was an attempt to imitate Newnham College, Cambridge. The building was designed by Harry Wilkinson Moore and built in two stages. The 1885-7 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and Vice-Principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left. This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals. The second building stage (1888-1895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge). It was renamed Park in honour of Daphne Park, the Principal from 1980 to 1989.\n\nThere are over 60 student rooms and Fellows' rooms within the building. There is a music room and computer room. Park is a Grade II-listed building.\n\nDesigned by Basil Champneys in 1903 and opened by John Morley the following year, Somerville College Library was the first purpose-built library amongst the women's colleges of the university. Specially for this opening, \"Demeter\" was written by Robert Bridges and performed for the first time. As such it was designed to serve readers beyond the membership of the college and to contain 60,000 volumes despite the college only possessing 6000 in 1903. The Grade II-listed building now contains around 120,000 items and is the second largest college library in the university.\n\nAmelia Edwards, John Stuart Mill, John Ruskin and Vera Brittain are notable benefactors to the library.\n\nThe John Stuart Mill room contains what was Mill's personal library in London at the time of his death, with significant annotations in many of the books.\n\nThe library dominates the north wing of the main quadrangle and is open 24 hours, with wifi access which is college-wide, a group study room, and many computers. It has with 100% the highest library satisfaction according to the annual student surveys.\n\nUntil 1911, there was no hall large enough to seat the entire college. The buildings were designed by Edmund Fisher in Queen Anne style and Edwardian Baroque architecture. Maitland Hall and Maitland were opened by H. A. L. Fisher, the Vice-Chancellor of the University and Gilbert Murray. Murray, whose translations of Greek drama were performed at Somerville in 1912 and 1946, supported Somerville in many ways, including endowing its first research fellowship. A fund was raised as a memorial to Miss Maitland, the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906. This money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of Mary Somerville by John Jackson. The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J. Forester in 1897 and bought from University and Balliol Colleges for £4000 and £1,400. There was difficulty in the construction of the buildings, which is now thought to have been the result of the outer limit of the Oxford city fortifications running under the site. In 1935, Morley Horder reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House. In 1947, André Gide gave a lecture in the hall.\n\nHall and Maitland form the East face of the main quad and are Grade II-listed buildings. The Senior Common Room is situated on the ground floor. The first floor is occupied by the pantry and the hall, in which Formal Hall (called guest night) is held weekly during term time.\n\nMaitland houses few students, being mainly occupied by Fellows' offices and the college IT office. The building is named after Principal Agnes Maitland, and is to the south of Hall.\n\nThe Penrose block was designed by Harold Rogers in 1925 and its first students were installed in 1927. It is situated at the south western end of the main quadrangle on the site of 119 and 119A Walton Street. A row of poplars had to be removed in 1926 for the construction of Penrose.\n\nThe building was refurbished in 2014, with carpets replacing the formerly bare wooden floorboards, and new furniture. Penrose is named for Dame Emily Penrose, the third principal of the college. Penrose houses mainly first year accommodation, with around 30 rooms. Some fellows' rooms are located in Penrose.\n\nDarbishire Quad was the culmination of a long-standing project to absorb Woodstock Road properties above the Oxford Oratory. In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of St Giles' Church, Oxford, for the sum of £1,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining 'Waggon and Horses' was purchased from St John's College, Oxford, in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\nMorley Horder was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures with a loan of £12,000 from Christ Church. The porters' lodge and a council room, the New Council Room, were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduate and fellows' rooms. The coat of arms of Somerville and that of co-founder John Percival, first principal Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre and Helen Darbishire were carved by Edmund Ware inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally it was called the East Quadrangle and it was opened in June 1934 by Lord Halifax, who called it 'a notable addition to buildings of varying styles' (\"varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile\") in the Creweian Oration during the Encaenia. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, Helen Darbishire.\n\nToday Darbishire contains around 50 student rooms mixed with tutors' offices, the college archive and medical room. The offices of the Global Ocean Commission, co-chaired by José María Figueres, Trevor Manuel and David Miliband, were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville, from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of \"Gaudy Night\" by alumna Dorothy L. Sayers and is home to a clock donated by alumna Eleanor Rathbone.\n\nBuilt largely with funds provided by alumna Emily Georgiana Kemp in 1935, Somerville Chapel reflects the nondenominational principle on which the college was founded in 1879. No religious texts were used for admission and nondenominational Christian prayers were said in college. The chapel's history, architecture, and artworks give valuable insights into the religious, intellectual, and cultural roots of what would subsequently become a global norm. The chapel can be seen as both a manifestation of the aspirations of liberal Christianity in the interwar years, including the advancement of women and ecumenism, and of the contestation of the role of religion in higher education among elites in the same period.\n\nThe chapel does not have a chaplain, but a 'Chapel Director' which is in keeping with its undenominational tradition. The chapel provides opportunities for Christian worship in addition to hosting speakers with a multi-faith range of religious perspectives. The chapel also has an excellent mixed-voice choir, the Choir of Somerville College, which tours and produces occasional CDs.\n\nHostel is a small block between House and Darbishire, completed in 1950 by Geddes Hyslop. It houses 10 students over three floors. The Bursary is on the ground floor.\n\nHoltby, designed in 1951 and completed in 1956 by Hyslop, is situated above the library extension, adjacent to Park. It has 10 rooms for undergraduates and is named for alumna Winifred Holtby.\n\nDesigned by Sir Philip Dowson between 1958 and 1966, Vaughan and Margery Fry & Elizabeth Nuffield House (commonly shortened to Margery Fry) are both named for former principals of the college, whilst Elizabeth Nuffield was an important proponent of women's education and along with her husband Lord Nuffield, a financial benefactor of the college. Margery Fry was opened in 1964 by Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit and Vaughan was opened in 1966. Constructed in the same architectural style, with an exterior concrete frame standing away from the walls of the interior edifice, the two buildings sit atop a podium containing shops and an arcaded walkway on Little Clarendon Street.\n\nVaughan is the larger of the two, with 11 rows to its concrete frame compared to the 8 of Margery Fry. It is a Grade II-listed building. Vaughan contains around 60 undergraduate rooms, which are smaller than those of Margery Fry and house exclusively first year students, along with the junior deans. Vaughan was refurbished in 2013, with new bathroom facilities, including, for the first time, sinks. Beneath the two buildings, a tunnel provides access to Somerville from Little Clarendon Street.\n\nMargery Fry serves as the centre of the post graduate student community at Somerville and contains 24 graduate rooms. Other accommodation for graduate students is provided in buildings adjacent to the College.\n\nSir Philip Dowson was commissioned to design a building at the back of the college, to house undergraduates and offices for fellows. Wolfson is, in common with Dowson's other work in Somerville, constructed largely of glass and concrete. It is a Grade II-listed building. A four-storey building, with five bays of each floor, Wolfson boasts impressive views of Walton Street from the rear and Somerville's main quadrangle from the front. Wolfson is named for the building's principal benefactor Sir Isaac Wolfson and opened in 1967 by Principal Barbara Craig, with Harold Macmillan, Dorothy Hodgkin and Lord Wolfson giving speeches.\n\nThe ground floor of the building contains the Flora Anderson Hall or FAH and the Brittain-Williams Room, named for the college's most famous mother-daughter alumnae. The room was designed in 2012 by Niall McLaughlin Architects and opened on 29 November 2013 by alumna Baroness Shirley Williams during an event which saw her unveil a portrait of herself, which now hangs in the room. The FAH is used for lectures and events. Notably it hosts college parties and mock exams known as bops and Collections respectively.\n\nNamed for the alumna-Prime Minister, the MTC comprises a lobby, lecture room and ante room used for many meetings, with disabled access. The lecture room enjoys AV facilities and can accommodate 60 seated patrons. The venue is used for certain term time events and is popular with conferences. A bust of Margaret Thatcher stands in the lobby, and the meeting room contains portraits of Somerville's two prime-minister alumnae, Margaret Thatcher by Michael Noakes and Indira Gandhi by Sanjay Bhattacharyya.\n\nThe Dorothy Hodgkin Quad (DHQ) was conceived in 1985 and completed in 1991. It houses mainly finalists and some second year students. The Quadrangle is above the MTC and designed around self-contained flats of two and four bedrooms with communal kitchens. DHQ is named for Somerville's Nobel Prize winning laureate.\n\nArchitect Geoffrey Beard's scheme was submitted to the Oxford City Council in 1986 and energies of Sir Geoffrey Leigh and alumna and former Principal Baroness Daphne Park brought support from around the world. The buildings were opened in 1991 by Margaret Thatcher, Dorothy Hodgkin, Principal Catherine Hughes and College Visitor Baron Roy Jenkins.\n\nSomerville College was the first Oxford college to provide a nursery for the children of Fellows and staff and is still one of the few colleges to do so. Alumna Dorothy Hodgkin donated much of her Nobel Prize money to the project. St Paul’s Nursery is also open to families who are not connected with the college and cares for 16 children between the ages of 3 months and 5 years.\n\nROQ East and West flank the north side of Somerville and overlook the site of the university's principal development, the Blavatnik School of Government. Completed in 2011, the ROQ buildings were the first buildings on the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter and have won 4 awards for their architect Niall McLaughlin. The project was also awarded Oxford City Council's David Steel Sustainable Building Award, being commended for its balancing of Somervillian collegiate heritage with the need for energy efficiency to be a consideration for the new building. Energy efficiency measures include renewable technologies such as solar thermal energy and ground source heat pumps.\n\nThe buildings house 68 students and all rooms are en-suite. There are a number of rooms and facilities specifically designed to help those with disabilities, including lifts and adjoining carer rooms. The buildings were made possible by donations of over £2.7 million from over 1000 alumni and friends of the college, and by a significant loan. There is now an unimpeded view of the Observatory.\n\nThe most recent construction in Somerville (2013), the college bar in Vaughan replaces the bar in House. The bar is housed in a mainly glass structure, with seating in the college colours of red and black. Following a campaign by the JCR Guinness is now available on tap, and the pool table costs 50p per frame. The college drink, the \"Stone-cold Jane Austen\", is made from blue VK, Southern Comfort, and Magners cider. Other college drinks are the \"Somerville Sunset\" and the \"College Triple\". The college also has its own 'Somerville wine': red, white and sparkling.\n\nNamed after Somerville's late Principal from 1989 to 1996, the Catherine Hughes Building will be completed in October 2019 and will provide 68 additional bedrooms. The new building, designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects, boasts en suite bathrooms, kitchens and accessible rooms on every floor and a new communal study area for students.\n\nThe red brick building will have a frontage on to Walton Street and additional access from the college gardens, aligning with key levels on the adjacent Penrose Building. The bedrooms will be arranged in clusters with kitchens and circulation spaces forming social focal points.\n\nThe building's construction has given Somerville sufficient accommodation to allow all students applying from 2017 to live in college for the entirety of their 3 to 4-year undergraduate degree and Somerville is one of only three Oxford colleges able to do so.\n\nSomerville is the only Oxford college where students may walk on the grass and it has a vast green space behind the unassuming front gate, looked after by two gardeners.\n\nThe original site comprised a paddock, an orchard and a vegetable garden and was bounded by large trees. It was home to a donkey, two cows a pony and a pig. The paddock was soon transformed into tennis courts, where huge tents where erected during WWI. During World War Two, large water tanks were dug in the Main Quad and Darbishire Quad, in case or firebombing and the lawns were dug up and planted with vegetables.\n\nIn the Main Quad there's a cedar planted by Harold Macmillan in 1976, after an old cedar was victim of a winter storm. Another tree, a \"Picea likiangensis\", was planted in 2007 on the chapel lawn, providing Somerville with an outdoor Christmas tree. The library border of lavender and \"Agapanthus\" references the bluestocking reputation of Somerville and the tory blue \"Ceratostigma willmottianum\" is planted outside the Margaret Thatcher Centre. Beardtongues, \"Begonia\" and 1,200 red and black tulips reflect the college's colours. There are nods to Somerville's long-standing links with India, a strip of Alpine plants in front of Wolfson, a bog garden, herbaceous borders and the emblematic Somerville thistles (\"Echinops\"). The western wall of Penrose and the northern wall of Vaughan form two faces of the Fellows Garden, previously kitchen gardens, which is distinct from the main quad and separated from it by a hedge and a wall. The Fellows Garden is home to a sundial, commissioned in 1926, and a garden roller which was a gift from the parents of tutor Rose Sidgwick.\n\nIn 1962, Henry Moore lend his item \"Falling Warrior\" to the college and Barbara Hepworth lent \"Core\" shortly afterwards. Permanent sculptures in Somerville's garden are made by Wendy Taylor, Friedrich Werthmann and Somervillian Polly Ionides.\n\nIn 2011 student satisfaction was rated in some categories as the highest in the university. Central to the college is its large quad, onto which most accommodation blocks back; it is often filled with students in summer. Somerville is the only Oxford college where students (as opposed to just fellows) may walk on the grass. Somerville is sometimes nicknamed \"The Ville\". Formal Halls take place on some Tuesdays and Fridays about six times a term. No gowns are worn and the grace is 'benedictus benedicat'.\n\nSomerville has a gym situated beneath Vaughan, with treadmills, cross-trainers and weights. Somerville shares a sports ground with Wadham College and St. Hugh's College, on Marston Ferry Road. There are clubs and teams in men's and women's football, rugby (with Corpus Christi), mixed lacrosse, cricket, swimming, hockey, netball, basketball, pool, water polo, tennis, squash, badminton, cycling and croquet.\n\nBoth the Somerville cricket and netball team won Cuppers for the 2014/15 season. The swimming team won Cuppers for the 2015/2016 season.\n\nSomerville formed a rowing team in 1921. The college competes in both of the annual university bumps races, Torpids and Summer Eights. The women are the most successful women's rowing team at the University of Oxford, having won the title Head of the River eight times in Summer Eights and five times in Torpids. The club shares the award-winning University College Boathouse on The Isis with St Peter's College, University College and Wolfson College.\n\nThe Choir of Somerville College is mixed voice and is led by the Director of Chapel Music, Will Dawes. In conjunction with the organ scholars, the choir is central to the musical life of the college.\n\nThere are regular concerts and cathedral visits as well as recitals featuring soloists from the choir. In recent years the choir has undertaken tours of Germany (2005 and 2009), Italy (2010) and the USA (2014 and 2016). The choir sings every Sunday during term time at the evening service. The organ of the college chapel is a traditionally voiced instrument by Harrison & Harrison.\n\nSomerville offers up to five Choral Exhibitions each year to applicants reading any subject. College Organ Scholars are guaranteed rooms in college for the duration of their course.\n\nThe college choir has released two CDs on the Stone Records label, \"Requiem Aeternam\" (2012) and \"Advent Calendar\" (2013).\n\nOnce every three years Somerville hosts a ball which is organised with Jesus College, Oxford. The last ball was held in May 2016 and the next ball will be held in 2019, with a capacity of 1500 people.\n\nThe 2013 ball, \"The Last Ball\", was mired in controversy, which was reported in national news. The organisers had intended to display a live nurse shark as entertainment. Permission for the shark was initially granted by principal Alice Prochaska, but was subsequently revoked following student protests. The ball was widely condemned for poor organisation, examples of which included a lack of canapés and the presence of only one food stand, serving pork; the vegetarian options were said to run out quickly and revellers were reportedly set on fire by the pork rotisserie. \"The Guardian\" reported 'The ball descended into farce with guests questioning what the organisers had done with the money paid by 1,000 guests.'\n\nBefore men were admitted to the college, and under the principalship of Barbara Craig, Somerville established a position at, or near the head of the Norrington Table. Currently, by academic performance, Somerville is in the lower half of Oxford University colleges. \nFor the academic year 2016/17, the college came 22nd out of 30 in the Norrington Table, which lists the University's undergraduate colleges in order of their students' examination performances.\n\nSomerville has recently enjoyed success on TV quiz show \"University Challenge\" disproportionate to the college's size. The college has won the competition once, triumphing in the University Challenge 2001–02 series and beating Imperial College, London by 200 points to 185. Croatian quizzer Dorjana Širola was one of the contestants. Most recently, the college team reached the final of the University Challenge 2013–14 series, losing in the final to Trinity College, Cambridge, with a score of 134 to 240.\n\nDuring Trinity term 2015, Somerville was subject to national media coverage as a result of the efforts of principal Alice Prochaska to tackle 'a rise in \"excessively harassing and intimidating behaviour\" towards female students.' The \"Daily Telegraph\" quoted Prochaska as describing 'numerous reports of groping at college parties, rape jokes overheard in communal areas'. The principal wrote in \"The Guardian\" of measures taken to address harassment and she expressed her hope that 'a spasm of nastiness among a small minority of students here has been nipped in the bud by the open condemnation of the majority.'\n\nSomerville College plays a major role in the relationship between Oxford and India. Cornelia Sorabji, who was born in the Bombay Presidency of British India, became the first Indian woman to study at any British university when she came to Somerville in 1889 to study Law and Indira Gandhi, India's first female Prime Minister, studied Modern History at the college in 1937. Radhabai Subbarayan, first woman member of the Indian Council of States (Rajya Sabha) studied at Somerville College as well. Other alumni with links to India include Moon Moon Sen, Agnes de Selincourt, Smit Singh, and Utsa Patnaik. Former Principal Barbara Craig (1967-1980) and fellow Aditi Lahiri were born in Kolkata.\n\nSonia Gandhi visited Somerville in 2002 and presented a portrait of her late mother-in-law to her alma mater. Indira Gandhi received an honorary degree from the college in 1971.\n\nIn 2012, the college and Oxford University announced the creation of a £19m \"Indira Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development\". India provided £3 million and the university and college £5.5 million. The name was later changed to the \"Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development\" (OICSD). The building will be located at the college. The OICSD carries out research on sustainable development challenges facing India and provides scholarships for outstanding Indian students. The centre now hosts 12 India scholars.\n\nSomerville's choir will be the first Oxford college choir to tour India.\n\nSomervillians include Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and Indira Gandhi, Nobel Prize winning scientist Dorothy Hodgkin, journalist Esther Rantzen, reformer Cornelia Sorabji, writers A. S. Byatt, Vera Brittain, Susan Cooper, Penelope Fitzgerald, Winifred Holtby, Iris Murdoch and Dorothy L. Sayers, politicians Shirley Williams, Margaret Jay and Sam Gyimah, Princess Bamba Sutherland and her sister, philosophers Philippa Foot, Mary Midgley and Onora O'Neill, archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon, actress Moon Moon Sen, soprano Emma Kirkby and numerous (women's rights) activists.\n\nSomerville alumnae have achieved an impressive number of \"firsts\", both (inter)nationally and at the University of Oxford. The most distinguishable being that of the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher; the first, and only, British woman to win a Nobel Prize in science Dorothy Hodgkin and the first woman to lead the world's largest democracy Indira Gandhi, who was Prime Minister of India for much of the 1970s.\n\nSomerville educated at least twenty-six Dames, fourteen heads of Oxford colleges, ten MP's, ten life peers, four Olympic rowers, three of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\", two prime ministers, two princesses, a queen consort and a Nobel laureate.\n\nFormers students of Somerville belong to an alumni group, the Somerville Association, which was originally founded in 1888.\n\nNotable fellows of Somerville College include philosopher G. E. M. Anscombe, classical archaeologist Margarete Bieber, Egyptologist Käte Bosse-Griffiths, biologist Marian Dawkins, classicist Edith Hall, author Alan Hollinghurst, astronomer Chris Lintott, International Federation of University Women founder Rose Sidgwick and botanist Timothy Walker.\n\nThe first principal of Somerville Hall was Madeleine Shaw-Lefèvre (from 1879–1889). The first principal of Somerville College was Agnes Catherine Maitland (1889–1906) when in 1894 it became the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of 'college', the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, the first to set an entrance examination, and the first to build a library. She was succeeded by classical scholar Emily Penrose (1906–1926), who established the \"Mary Somerville Research Fellowship\" in 1903 which was the first to offer women in Oxford opportunities for research.\n\nThe current Principal is Janet Royall, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon who took up the appointment in August 2017, succeeding Alice Prochaska.\n\nSix principals were alumnae of Somerville, two of St Hilda's College.\n\nLike all Oxford colleges, Somerville has a variety of symbols and colours which are associated with it. The college's colours, which feature on the college scarf and on the blades of its boats, are red and black. The combination was originally adopted in the 1890s. Its flag has the shield from the arms on a yellow background.\n\nThe two colours also feature in the college's coat of arms which depicts three mullets in chevron reversed gules, between six crosses crosslet fitched sable. The college's motto is \"Donec rursus impleat orbem\" which was originally the motto of the family of Mary Somerville. Her family befriended the new hall, allowing it to adopt their arms and motto. The Latin motto itself is described as \"baffling\" as, although it translates as \"Until It Should Fill the World Again\", what the subject of the sentence (\"it\") is left unspecified. The crest, which is often omitted, is a hand grasping a crescent and occasionally a helmet with mantling is added.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29040", "title": "Stokes' theorem", "text": "Stokes' theorem\n\nIn vector calculus, and more generally differential geometry, Stokes' theorem (also called the generalized Stokes theorem or the Stokes–Cartan theorem) is a statement about the integration of differential forms on manifolds, which both simplifies and generalizes several theorems from vector calculus. Stokes' theorem says that the integral of a differential form over the boundary of some orientable manifold is equal to the integral of its exterior derivative over the whole of , i.e.,\n\nStokes' theorem was formulated in its modern form by Élie Cartan in 1945, following earlier work on the generalization of the theorems of vector calculus by Vito Volterra, Édouard Goursat, and Henri Poincaré.\n\nThis modern form of Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of a classical result that Lord Kelvin communicated to George Stokes in a letter dated July 2, 1850. Stokes set the theorem as a question on the 1854 Smith's Prize exam, which led to the result bearing his name. It was first published by Hermann Hankel in 1861. This classical Kelvin–Stokes theorem relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field over a surface in Euclidean three-space to the line integral of the vector field over its boundary: Let be a piecewise smooth Jordan plane curve. The Jordan curve theorem implies that divides into two components, a compact one and another that is non-compact. Let denote the compact part that is bounded by and suppose is smooth, with . If is the space curve defined by and is a smooth vector field on , then:\n\nThis classical statement, along with the classical divergence theorem, the fundamental theorem of calculus, and Green's theorem are simply special cases of the general formulation stated above.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus states that the integral of a function over the interval can be calculated by finding an antiderivative of :\n\nStokes' theorem is a vast generalization of this theorem in the following sense. \nIn even simpler terms, one can consider the points as boundaries of curves, that is as 0-dimensional boundaries of 1-dimensional manifolds. So, just as one can find the value of an integral () over a 1-dimensional manifold () by considering the anti-derivative () at the 0-dimensional boundaries (), one can generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus, with a few additional caveats, to deal with the value of integrals () over -dimensional manifolds () by considering the antiderivative () at the -dimensional boundaries () of the manifold.\n\nSo the fundamental theorem reads:\n\nLet be an oriented smooth manifold with boundary of dimension and let be a smooth -differential form that is compactly supported on . First, suppose that is compactly supported in the domain of a single, oriented coordinate chart . In this case, we define the integral of over as\n\ni.e., via the pullback of to .\n\nMore generally, the integral of over is defined as follows: Let be a partition of unity associated with a locally finite cover of (consistently oriented) coordinate charts, then define the integral\n\nwhere each term in the sum is evaluated by pulling back to as described above. This quantity is well-defined; that is, it does not depend on the choice of the coordinate charts, nor the partition of unity.\n\nThe generalized Stokes theorem reads:\n\nConventionally, formula_7 is abbreviated as formula_8, since the pullback of a differential form by the inclusion map is simply its restriction to its domain: formula_9. Here formula_10 is the exterior derivative, which is defined using the manifold structure only. The right-hand side is sometimes written as formula_11 to stress the fact that the formula_12-manifold formula_13 has no boundary. (This fact is also an implication of Stokes' theorem, since for a given smooth formula_14-dimensional manifold formula_15, application of the theorem twice gives formula_16 for any formula_17-form formula_18, which implies that formula_19.) The right-hand side of the equation is often used to formulate \"integral\" laws; the left-hand side then leads to equivalent \"differential\" formulations (see below).\n\nThe theorem is often used in situations where formula_15 is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold, often formula_21, on which the form formula_18 is defined.\n\nLet be a smooth manifold. A (smooth) singular -simplex in is defined as a smooth map from the standard simplex in to . The group of singular -chains on is defined to be the free abelian group on the set of singular -simplices in . These groups, together with the boundary map, , define a chain complex. The corresponding homology (resp. cohomology) group is isomorphic to the usual singular homology group (resp. the singular cohomology group ), defined using continuous rather than smooth simplices in .\n\nOn the other hand, the differential forms, with exterior derivative, , as the connecting map, form a cochain complex, which defines the de Rham cohomology groups .\n\nDifferential -forms can be integrated over a -simplex in a natural way, by pulling back to . Extending by linearity allows one to integrate over chains. This gives a linear map from the space of -forms to the th group of singular cochains, , the linear functionals on . In other words, a -form defines a functional\n\non the -chains. Stokes' theorem says that this is a chain map from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology with real coefficients; the exterior derivative, , behaves like the \"dual\" of on forms. This gives a homomorphism from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology. On the level of forms, this means:\n\n\nDe Rham's theorem shows that this homomorphism is in fact an isomorphism. So the converse to 1 and 2 above hold true. In other words, if are cycles generating the th homology group, then for any corresponding real numbers, , there exist a closed form, , such that\n\nand this form is unique up to exact forms.\n\nStokes' theorem on smooth manifolds can be derived from Stokes' theorem for chains in smooth manifolds, and vice versa. Formally stated, the latter reads:\n\nTo simplify these topological arguments, it is worthwhile to examine the underlying principle by considering an example for dimensions. The essential idea can be understood by the diagram on the left, which shows that, in an oriented tiling of a manifold, the interior paths are traversed in opposite directions; their contributions to the path integral thus cancel each other pairwise. As a consequence, only the contribution from the boundary remains. It thus suffices to prove Stokes' theorem for sufficiently fine tilings (or, equivalently, simplices), which usually is not difficult.\n\nThe formulation above, in which is a smooth manifold with boundary, does not suffice in many applications. For example, if the domain of integration is defined as the plane region between two -coordinates and the graphs of two functions, it will often happen that the domain has corners. In such a case, the corner points mean that is not a smooth manifold with boundary, and so the statement of Stokes' theorem given above does not apply. Nevertheless, it is possible to check that the conclusion of Stokes' theorem is still true. This is because and its boundary are well-behaved away from a small set of points (a measure zero set).\n\nA version of Stokes' theorem that extends to rough domains was proved by Whitney. Assume that is a connected bounded open subset of . Call a \"standard domain\" if it satisfies the following property: There exists a subset of , open in , whose complement in has Hausdorff -measure zero; and such that every point of has a \"generalized normal vector\". This is a vector such that, if a coordinate system is chosen so that is the first basis vector, then, in an open neighborhood around , there exists a smooth function such that is the graph and is the region . Whitney remarks that the boundary of a standard domain is the union of a set of zero Hausdorff -measure and a finite or countable union of smooth -manifolds, each of which has the domain on only one side. He then proves that if is a standard domain in , is an -form which is defined, continuous, and bounded on , smooth on , integrable on , and such that is integrable on , then Stokes' theorem holds, that is,\n\nThe study of measure-theoretic properties of rough sets leads to geometric measure theory. Even more general versions of Stokes' theorem have been proved by Federer and by Harrison.\n\nThe general form of the Stokes theorem using differential forms is more powerful and easier to use than the special cases. The traditional versions can be formulated using Cartesian coordinates without the machinery of differential geometry, and thus are more accessible. Further, they are older and their names are more familiar as a result. The traditional forms are often considered more convenient by practicing scientists and engineers but the non-naturalness of the traditional formulation becomes apparent when using other coordinate systems, even familiar ones like spherical or cylindrical coordinates. There is potential for confusion in the way names are applied, and the use of dual formulations.\n\nThis is a (dualized) (1 + 1)-dimensional case, for a 1-form (dualized because it is a statement about vector fields). This special case is often just referred to as \"Stokes' theorem\" in many introductory university vector calculus courses and is used in physics and engineering. It is also sometimes known as the curl theorem.\n\nThe classical Kelvin–Stokes theorem relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field over a surface in Euclidean three-space to the line integral of the vector field over its boundary. It is a special case of the general Stokes theorem (with ) once we identify a vector field with a 1-form using the metric on Euclidean 3-space. The curve of the line integral, , must have positive orientation, meaning that points counterclockwise when the surface normal, , points toward the viewer.\n\nOne consequence of the Kelvin–Stokes theorem is that the field lines of a vector field with zero curl cannot be closed contours. The formula can be rewritten as:\n\nGreen's theorem is immediately recognizable as the third integrand of both sides in the integral in terms of , , and cited above.\n\nTwo of the four Maxwell equations involve curls of 3-D vector fields and their differential and integral forms are related by the Kelvin–Stokes theorem. Caution must be taken to avoid cases with moving boundaries: the partial time derivatives are intended to exclude such cases. If moving boundaries are included, interchange of integration and differentiation introduces terms related to boundary motion not included in the results below (see Differentiation under the integral sign):\nThe above listed subset of Maxwell's equations are valid for electromagnetic fields expressed in SI units. In other systems of units, such as CGS or Gaussian units, the scaling factors for the terms differ. For example, in Gaussian units, Faraday's law of induction and Ampère's law take the forms:\n\nrespectively, where is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nLikewise, the Ostrogradsky–Gauss theorem (also known as the divergence theorem or Gauss's theorem)\n\nis a special case if we identify a vector field with the -form obtained by contracting the vector field with the Euclidean volume form. An application of this is the case where is an arbitrary constant vector. Working out the divergence of the product gives\nSince this holds for all we find\n\n\n\n"}

What social psychologists call \"the principle of superficiality versus depth\" has pervaded Western culture since at least the time of Plato.\n\nSocrates sought to convince his debaters to turn from the superficiality of a worldview based on the acceptance of convention to the examined life of philosophy, founded (as Plato at least considered) upon the underlying Ideas. For more than two millennia, there was in the Platonic wake a general valorisation of critical thought over the superficial subjectivity that refused deep analysis. The salon style of the Précieuses might for a time affect superficiality, and play with the possibility of treating serious topics in a light-hearted fashion; but the prevailing western consensus firmly rejected elements such as everyday chatter or the changing vagaries of fashion as superficial distractions from a deeper reality.\n\nBy contrast, Nietzsche opened the modernist era with a self-conscious praise of superficiality: \"What is required is to stop courageously at the surface, the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words, in the whole Olympus of appearance! Those Greeks were superficial – \"out of profundity\"!\".\n\nHis (still) preference for superficiality was however over-shadowed for most of the 20th century by modernism's full subscription to the depth/surface model, and to the privileging of the former over the latter. Frederic Jameson has highlighted four main modernist versions of the belief in a \"deeper\" reality - Marxist, psychoanalytic, existential, and semiotic - in each of which reality is understood to be concealed behind an inauthentic surface or façade. Jameson contrast these models sharply with the lack of depth, the ahistoricity, the surface-focus and flatness of the postmodern consciousness, with its new cult of the image and the simulacrum.\n\nIn the last third of the 20th century, Lyotard began challenging the Platonic view of a true meaning hidden behind surface as a \"theatrical\" world-view, insisting instead that sense manifestations had their own reality which necessarily impacted upon the purely verbal order of intelligibility. Similarly, deconstruction has increasingly sought to undo the depth/surface hierarchy, proposing in ironic style that superficiality is as deep as depth. The result has been the call to abandon the idea that behind appearances there is any ultimate truth to be found; and in consequence the growing postmodern replacement of depth by surface, or by multiple surfaces. \n\nThat process of substitution was well under way by the 1990s, when notoriously \"surface was depth\", and in the new millennium has led to a state of what has been called hypervisibility: everything is on view. In this new era of exposure we are all submerged in what the psychoanalyst Michael Parsons has called \"the totalist world where there is a horror of inwardness; everything must be revealed\".\n\nIf postmodernism's proponents welcomed the way a new transcendence of the surface /depth dichotomy allowed a fuller appreciation of the possibilities of the superficial - the surface consciousness of the now, as opposed to the depths of historical time - critics like J. G. Ballard object that the end-product is a world of \"laws without penalties, events without significance, a sun without shadows\": of surface without depth. They see postmodern superficiality as a by-product of the false consciousness of global capitalism, where surface distractions, news, and entertainment supersaturate the zapping mind in such a way as to foreclose the possibility of envisioning any critical alternative.\n\nAlmost all depth psychologies defy the postmodern to value depth over surface - to aim, in David Cooper's words, for \"change from the depths of oneself upwards into the \"superficies\" of one's social appearance\". Debates may rage over whether to \"begin\" analysis at the surface or by way of deep interpretations, but this is essentially a question of timing. Thus for example Jungians would highlight at the start of therapy what they call the \"persona-restoring\" phase as an effort to preserve superficiality, but would later optimally see the client moving from the surface to deeper emotion and creativity.\n\nFritz Perls by contrast maintained that \"the simplicity of the Gestalt approach is that we pay attention to the obvious, to the utmost surface. We don't delve into a region which we don't know anything about, into the so-called 'unconscious. A similar focus on the superficial has fuelled much of the Freud Wars of late modernity, in which, according to Jonathan Lear, \"the real object of attack - for which Freud is only a stalking-horse - is the very idea that humans have unconscious motivation\". Given a choice of surface or depth—\"are we to see humans as having depth, layers of meaning which lie beneath the surface of their own understanding?\"—he asks: \"Or are we to take ourselves as transparent to ourselves...to ignore the complexity, depth and darkness of human life\"; the postmodern bias remains towards superficiality.\n\nSocial psychology considers that in everyday life social processing veers between superficiality, where we rely on first impressions and immediate judgements, and a deeper form of processing in which we seek to understand the other person more fully. In the ordinary course of life, we necessarily take others at face-value, and use ideal types/stereotypes to guide our daily activities; while institutions too can rely on the superficial consensus of groupthink to preclude deeper investigation.\n\nSome circumstances however necessitate a shift from superficial to extensive processing. When things become serious, we must put more and deeper thought into understanding, leaving superficial judgements to cases where the stakes are low, not high.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21666983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21666983", "title": "Synchronous frame", "text": "Synchronous frame\n\nA reference frame in which the time coordinate defines proper time for all co-moving observers is called \"synchronous\". It is built by choosing some time-like hypersurface as an origin, such that has in every point a normal along the time line (lies inside the light cone with an apex in that point); all interval elements on this hypersurface are space-like. A family of geodesics normal to this hypersurface are drawn and defined as the time coordinates with a beginning at the hypersurface.\n\nSuch a construct, and hence, choice of synchronous frame, is always possible though it is not unique. It allows any transformation of space coordinates that does not depend on time and, additionally, a transformation brought about by the arbitrary choice of hypersurface used for this geometric construct.\n\nSynchronization of clocks located at different space points means that events happening at different places can be measured as simultaneous if those clocks show the same times. In the special relativity theory, the space distance element \"dl\" is defined as the intervals between two very close events that occur at the same moment of time. In the general relativity theory this cannot be done, that is, one cannot define \"dl\" by just substituting \"dx\" = 0 in the metric. The reason for this is the different dependence between proper time and time coordinate \"x\" in different points of space.\n\nTo find \"dl\" in this case, one can first synchronize time over the whole space in the following way (Fig. 1): Bob sends a light signal from some space point \"B\" with coordinates \"x\" + \"dx\" to Alice who is at a very close point \"A\" with coordinates \"x\" and then Alice immediately reflects the signal back to Bob. The time necessary for this operation (measured by Bob), multiplied by \"c\" is, obviously, the doubled distance between Alice and Bob.\n\nThe squared interval, with separated space and time coordinates, is:\n\nwhere a repeated Greek index within a term means summation by values 1, 2, 3. The interval between the events of signal arrival in point \"A\" and its immediate reflection back is zero (two events in the same time at the same point). Equation \"ds\" = 0 solved for \"dx\" gives two roots:\nwhich correspond to the propagation of the signal in both directions between Alice and Bob. If \"x\" is the moment of arrival/reflection of the signal to/from Alice, the moments of signal departure from Bob and its arrival back to Bob correspond, respectively, to \"x\" + \"dx\" and \"x\" + \"dx\". The thick lines on Fig. 1 are the world lines of Alice and Bob with coordinates \"x\" and \"x\" + \"dx\", respectively, while the red lines are the world lines of the signals. Fig. 1 supposes that \"dx\" is positive and \"dx\" is negative, which, however, is not necessarily the case: \"dx\" and \"dx\" may have the same sign. The fact that in the latter case the value \"x\" (Alice) in the moment of signal arrival at Alice's position may be less than the value \"x\" (Bob) in the moment of signal departure from Bob does not contain a contradiction because clocks in different points of space are not supposed to be synchronized. It is clear that the full \"time\" interval between departure and arrival of the signal in Bob's place is\n\nThe respective proper time interval is obtained from the above relationship by multiplication by formula_3, and the distance \"dl\" between the two points – by additional multiplication by \"c\"/2. As a result:\n\nThis is the required relationship that defines distance through the space coordinate elements.\n\nIt is obvious that such synchronization should be done by exchange of light signals between points. Consider again propagation of signals between infinitesimally close points \"A\" and \"B\" in Fig. 1. The clock reading in \"B\" which is simultaneous with the moment \"x\" in \"A\" lies in the middle between the moments of sending and receiving the signal in \"B\"; this is the moment\nSubstitute here to find the difference in \"time\" \"x\" between two simultaneous events occurring in infinitesimally close points as\nThis relationship allows clock synchronization in any infinitesimally small space volume. By continuing such synchronization further from point \"A\", one can synchronize clocks, that is, determine simultaneity of events along any open line. The synchronization condition can be written in another form by multiplying by \"g\" and bringing terms to the left hand side \n\nor, the \"covariant differential\" \"dx\" between two infinitesimally close points should be zero.\n\nHowever, it is impossible, in general, to synchronize clocks along a closed contour: starting out along the contour and returning to the starting point one would obtain a Δ\"x\" value different from zero. Thus, unambiguous synchronization of clocks over the whole space is impossible. An exception are reference frames in which all components \"g\" are zeros.\n\nNote the inability to synchronize all clocks is a property of the reference frame and not of the spacetime itself. It is always possible in infinitely many ways in any gravitational field to choose the reference frame so that the three \"g\" become zeros and thus enable a complete synchronization of clocks. To this class are assigned cases where \"g\" can be made zeros by a simple change in the time coordinate which does not involve a choice of a system of objects that define the space coordinates.\n\nIn the special relativity theory, too, proper time elapses differently for clocks moving relatively to each other. In general relativity, proper time is different even in the same reference frame at different points of space. This means that the interval of proper time between two events occurring at some space point and the time interval between the events simultaneous with those at another space point are, in general, different from one another.\n\nRewrite in the form\n\nwhere\n\nis the three-dimensional metric tensor that determines the metric, that is, the geometrical properties of space. Equations give the relationships between the metric of the three-dimensional space and the metric of the four-dimensional spacetime.\n\nIn general, however, the metric \"g\" depends on \"x\" so that the space metric changes with time. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to integrate \"dl\": this integral depends on the choice of world line between the two points on which it is taken. It follows that in general relativity the distance between two bodies cannot be determined in general; this distance is determined only for infinitesimally close points. Distance can be determined also for finite space regions only in such reference frames in which \"g\" does not depend on time and therefore the integral ∫\"dl\" along the space curve acquires some definite sense.\n\nThe tensor –γ is inverse to the contravariant 3-dimensional tensor \"g\". Indeed, writing equation \"gg\" = formula_5 in components, one has:\n\nDetermine \"g\" from the second equation and substitute in the first to obtain\n\nwhich was to be demonstrated. This result can be presented otherwise by saying that \"g\" are components of a contravariant 3-dimensional tensor corresponding to metric :\n\nThe determinants \"g\" and γ composed of elements \"g\" and γ, respectively, are related to each other by the simple relationship:\n\nIn many applications, it is convenient to define a 3-dimensional vector g with covariant components\n\nConsidering g as a vector in space with metric , its contravariant components can be written as \"g\" = γ\"g\". Using and the second of , it is easy to see that\n\nFrom the third of , it follows\n\nAs concluded from , the condition that allows clock synchronization in different space points is that metric tensor components \"g\" are zeros. If, in addition, \"g\" = 1, then the time coordinate \"x\" = \"t\" is the proper time in each space point (with \"c\" = 1). A reference frame that satisfies the conditions\n\nis called \"synchronous frame\". The interval element in this system is given by the expression\n\nwith the spatial metric tensor components identical (with opposite sign) to the components \"g\":\nIn synchronous frame time, time lines are normal to the hypersurfaces \"t\" = const. Indeed, the unit four-vector normal to such a hypersurface \"n\" = ∂\"t\"/∂\"x\" has covariant components \"n\" = 0, \"n\" = 1. The respective contravariant components with the conditions are again \"n\" = 0, \"n\" = 1.\n\nThe components of the unit normal coincide with those of the four-vector \"u\" = \"dx/ds\" which is tangent to the world line \"x\", \"x\", \"x\" = const. The \"u\" with components \"u\" = 0, \"u\" = 1 automatically satisfies the geodesic equations:\nsince, from the conditions , the Christoffel symbols formula_9 and formula_10 vanish identically. Therefore, in the synchronous reference system the time lines are geodesics in the spacetime.\n\nThese properties can be used to construct synchronous frame in any spacetime (Fig. 2). To this end, choose some spacelike hypersurface as an origin, such that has in every point a normal along the time line (lies inside the light cone with an apex in that point); all interval elements on this hypersurface are space-like. Then draw a family of geodesics normal to this hypersurface. Choose these lines as time coordinate lines and define the time coordinate \"t\" as the length \"s\" of the geodesic measured with a beginning at the hypersurface; the result is a synchronous frame.\n\nAn analytic transformation to synchronous frame can be done with the use of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation. The principle of this method is based on the fact that particle trajectories in gravitational fields are geodesics. The Hamilton–Jacobi equation for a particle (whose mass is set equal to unity) in a gravitational field is\n\nwhere \"S\" is the action. Its complete integral has the form:\n\nwhere \"f\" is a function of the four coordinates \"x\" and the three parameters ξ; the constant \"A\" is treated as an arbitrary function of the three ξ. With such a representation for \"S\" the equations for the trajectory of the particle can be obtained by equating the derivatives ∂\"S\"/∂ξ to zero, i.e. \nFor each set of assigned values of the parameters ξ, the right sides of equations have definite constant values, and the world line determined by these equations is one of the possible trajectories of the particle. Choosing the quantities ξ, which are constant along the trajectory, as new space coordinates, and the quantity \"S\" as the new time coordinate, one obtains a synchronous reference system; the transformation from the old coordinates to the new ones is given by equations . In fact, it is guaranteed that for such a transformation the time lines will be geodesics and will be normal to the hypersurfaces \"S\" = const. The latter point is obvious from the mechanical analogy: the four-vector ∂\"S\"/∂\"x\" which is normal to the hypersurface coincides in mechanics with the four-momentum of the particle, and therefore coincides in direction with its four-velocity \"u\" i.e. with the four-vector tangent to the trajectory. Finally the condition \"g\" = 1 is obviously satisfied, since the derivative −\"dS\"/\"ds\" of the action along the trajectory is the mass of the particle, which was set equal to 1; therefore |\"dS\"/\"ds\"| = 1.\n\nThe gauge conditions do not fix the coordinate system completely and therefore are not a fixed gauge, as the spacelike hypersurface at formula_11 can be chosen arbitrarily. One still have the freedom of performing some coordinate transformations containing four arbitrary functions depending on the three spatial variables \"x\", which are easily worked out in infinitesimal form:\n\nHere, the collections of the four old coordinates (\"t\", \"x\") and four new coordinates formula_12 are denoted by the symbols \"x\" and formula_13, respectively. The functions formula_14 together with their first derivatives are infinitesimally small quantities. After such a transformation, the four-dimensional interval takes the form:\n\nwhere\n\nIn the last formula, the formula_15 are the same functions \"g\"(\"x\") in which \"x\" should simply be replaced by formula_13. If one wishes to preserve the gauge also for the new metric tensor formula_17 in the new coordinates formula_13, it is necessary to impose the following restrictions on the functions formula_19:\nThe solutions of these equations are:\nwhere \"f\" and \"f\" are four arbitrary functions depending only on the spatial coordinates formula_20.\n\nFor a more elementary geometrical explanation, consider Fig. 2. First, the synchronous time line ξ = \"t\" can be chosen arbitrarily (Bob's, Carol's, Dana's or any of an infinitely many observers). This makes one arbitrarily chosen function: formula_21. Second, the initial hypersurface can be chosen in infinitely many ways. Each of these choices changes three functions: one function for each of the three spatial coordinates formula_22. Altogether, four (= 1 + 3) functions are arbitrary.\n\nWhen discussing general solutions \"g\" of the field equations in synchronous gauges, it is necessary to keep in mind that the gravitational potentials \"g\" contain, among all possible arbitrary functional parameters present in them, four arbitrary functions of 3-space just representing the gauge freedom and therefore of no direct physical significance.\n\nAnother problem with the reference system is that caustics can occur which cause the gauge choice to break down. These problems have caused some difficulties doing cosmological perturbation theory in this system, but the problems are now well understood. Synchronous coordinates are generally considered the most efficient reference system for doing calculations, and are used in many modern cosmology codes, such as CMBFAST. They are also useful for solving theoretical problems in which a spacelike hypersurface needs to be fixed, as with spacelike singularities.\n\nIntroduction of a synchronous frame allows one to separate the operations of space and time differentiation in the Einstein field equations. To make them more concise, the notation\nis introduced for the time derivatives of the three-dimensional metric tensor; these quantities also form a three-dimensional tensor. In the synchronous frame formula_23 is proportional to the second fundamental form (shape tensor). All operations of shifting indices and covariant differentiation of the tensor formula_23 are done in three-dimensional space with the metric γ. This does not apply to operations of shifting indices in the space components of the four-tensors \"R\", \"T\". Thus \"T\" must be understood to be \"g\"\"T\" + \"g\"\"T\", which reduces to \"g\"\"T\" and differs in sign from γ\"T\". The sum formula_25 is the logarithmic derivative of the determinant γ ≡ |γ| = − \"g\":\nThen for the complete set of Christoffel symbols formula_26 one obtains:\n\nwhere formula_27 are the three-dimensional Christoffel symbols constructed from γ:\n\nwhere the comma denotes partial derivative by the respective coordinate.\n\nWith the Christoffel symbols , the components \"R\" = \"gR\" of the Ricci tensor can be written in the form:\nDots on top denote time differentiation, semicolons (\";\") denote covariant differentiation which in this case is performed with respect to the three-dimensional metric γ with three-dimensional Christoffel symbols formula_27, formula_29, and \"P\" is a three-dimensional Ricci tensor constructed from formula_27:\n\nIt follows from that the Einstein equations formula_31 (with the components of the energy-momentum tensor \"T\" = −\"T\", \"T\" = −\"T\", \"T\" = γ\"T\") become in a synchronous coordinate system:\nA characteristic feature of synchronous reference systems is that they are not stationary: the gravitational field cannot be constant in such a system. In a constant field formula_23 would become zero. But in the presence of matter the disappearance of all formula_23 would contradict (which has a right side different from zero). In empty space from follows that all \"P\", and with them all the components of the three-dimensional curvature tensor \"P\" (Riemann tensor) vanish, i.e. the field vanishes entirely (in a synchronous system with a Euclidean spatial metric the space-time is flat).\n\nAt the same time the matter filling the space cannot in general be at rest relative to the synchronous reference frame. This is obvious from the fact that particles of matter within which there are pressures generally move along lines that are not geodesics; the world line of a particle at rest is a time line, and thus is a geodesic in the synchronous reference system. An exception is the case of dust (\"p\" = 0). Here the particles interacting with one another will move along geodesic lines; consequently, in this case the condition for a synchronous reference system does not contradict the condition that it be comoving with the matter. Even in this case, in order to be able to choose a synchronously comoving system of reference, it is still necessary that the matter move without rotation. In the comoving system the contravariant components of the velocity are \"u\" = 1, \"u\" = 0. If the reference system is also synchronous, the covariant components must satisfy \"u\" = 1, \"u\" = 0, so that its four-dimensional curl must vanish:\nBut this tensor equation must then also be valid in any other reference frame. Thus, in a synchronous but not comoving system the condition curl v = 0 for the three-dimensional velocity v is additionally needed. For other equations of state a similar situation can occur only in special cases when the pressure gradient vanishes in all or in certain directions.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3741564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3741564", "title": "Type (model theory)", "text": "Type (model theory)\n\nIn model theory and related areas of mathematics, a type is an object that, loosely speaking, describes how a (real or possible) element or elements in a mathematical structure might behave. More precisely, it is a set of first-order formulas in a language \"L\" with free variables \"x\", \"x\",…, \"x\" that are true of a sequence of elements of an \"L\"-structure formula_1. Depending on the context, types can be complete or partial and they may use a fixed set of constants, \"A\", from the structure formula_1. The question of which types represent actual elements of formula_1 leads to the ideas of saturated models and omitting types.\n\nConsider a structure formula_1 for a language \"L\". Let \"M\" be the universe of the structure. For every \"A\" ⊆ \"M\", let \"L\"(\"A\") be the language obtained from \"L\" by adding a constant \"c\" for every \"a\" ∈ \"A\". In other words,\n\nA 1-type (of formula_1) over \"A\" is a set \"p\"(\"x\") of formulas in \"L\"(\"A\") with at most one free variable \"x\" (therefore 1-type) such that for every finite subset \"p\"(\"x\") ⊆ \"p\"(\"x\") there is some \"b\" ∈ \"M\", depending on \"p\"(\"x\"), with formula_7 (i.e. all formulas in \"p\"(\"x\") are true in formula_1 when \"x\" is replaced by \"b\").\n\nSimilarly an n\"-type (of formula_1) over \"A\" is defined to be a set \"p\"(\"x\",…,\"x\") = \"p\"(x) of formulas in \"L\"(\"A\"), each having its free variables occurring only among the given \"n\" free variables \"x\",…,\"x\", such that for every finite subset \"p\"(x) ⊆ \"p\"(x\") there are some elements \"b\",…,\"b\" ∈ \"M\" with formula_10.\n\nComplete type refers to those types that are maximal with respect to inclusion, i.e. if \"p\"(x) is a complete type, then for every formula_11 either formula_12 or formula_13. Any non-complete type is called a partial type. \nSo, the word type in general refers to any \"n\"-type, partial or complete, over any chosen set of parameters (possibly the empty set).\n\nAn \"n\"-type \"p\"(x) is said to be realized in formula_1 if there is an element b ∈ \"M\" such that formula_15. The existence of such a realization is guaranteed for any type by the Compactness theorem, although the realization might take place in some elementary extension of formula_1, rather than in formula_1 itself. \nIf a complete type is realized by b in formula_1, then the type is typically denoted formula_19 and referred to as the complete type of \"b\" over \"A\".\n\nA type \"p\"(x) is said to be isolated by \"φ, for formula_20, if formula_21. Since finite subsets of a type are always realized in formula_1, there is always an element b ∈ \"M\" such that \"φ\"(b) is true in formula_1; i.e. formula_24, thus b\" realizes the entire isolated type. So isolated types will be realized in every elementary substructure or extension. Because of this, isolated types can never be omitted (see below).\n\nA model that realizes the maximum possible variety of types is called a saturated model, and the ultrapower construction provides one way of producing saturated models.\n\nConsider the language with one binary connective, which we denote as formula_25. Let formula_1 be the structure formula_27 for this language, which is the ordinal formula_28 with its standard well-ordering. Let formula_29 denote the theory of formula_1.\n\nConsider the set of formulas formula_31. First, we claim this is a type. Let formula_32 be a finite subset of formula_33. We need to find an formula_34 that satisfies all the formulas in formula_35. Well, we can just take the successor of the largest ordinal mentioned in the set of formulas formula_36. Then this will clearly contain all the ordinals mentioned in formula_36. Thus we have that formula_33 is a type. \nNext, note that formula_33 is not realized in formula_1. For, if it were there would be some formula_41 that contains every element of formula_28. \nIf we wanted to realize the type, we might be tempted to consider the model formula_43, which is indeed a supermodel of formula_1 that realizes the type. Unfortunately, this extension is not elementary, that is this model does not have to satisfy formula_29. In particular, the sentence formula_46 is satisfied by this model and not by formula_1.\n\nSo, we wish to realize the type in an elementary extension. We can do this by defining a new structure in this language, which we will denote formula_48. The domain of the structure will be formula_49 where formula_50 is the set of integers adorned in such a way that formula_51. Let formula_52 denote the usual order of formula_50. We interpret the symbol formula_25 in our new structure by formula_55. The idea being that we are adding a \"Z-chain\", or copy of the integers, above all the finite ordinals. Clearly any element of formula_50 realizes the type formula_33. Moreover, one can verify that this extension is elementary.\n\nAnother example: the complete type of the number 2 over the emptyset, considered as a member of the natural numbers, would be the set of all first-order statements describing a variable \"x\" that are true for \"x\" = 2. This set would include formulas such as formula_58, formula_59, and formula_60. This is an example of an isolated type, since the formula formula_61 implies all other formulas that are true about the number 2.\n\nFor example, the statements\n\nand\n\ndescribing the square root of 2 are consistent with the axioms of ordered fields, and can be extended to a complete type. This type is not realized in the ordered field of rational numbers, but is realized in the ordered field of reals. Similarly, the infinite set of formulas (over the emptyset) {x>1, x>1+1, x>1+1+1, ...} is not realized in the ordered field of real numbers, but is realized in the ordered field of hyperreals. If we allow more parameters, for instance all of the reals, we can specify a type formula_64 that is realized by an infinitesimal hyperreal that violates the Archimedean property.\n\nThe reason it is useful to restrict the parameters to a certain subset of the model is that it helps to distinguish the types that can be satisfied from those that cannot. For example, using the entire set of real numbers as parameters one could generate an uncountably infinite set of formulas like formula_65, formula_66, ... that would explicitly rule out every possible real value for \"x\", and therefore could never be realized within the real numbers.\n\nIt is useful to consider the set of complete \"n\"-types over \"A\" as a topological space. Consider the following equivalence relation on formulae in the free variables \"x\",…, \"x\" with parameters in \"M\":\nOne can show that formula_68 iff they are contained in exactly the same complete types.\n\nThe set of formulae in free variables \"x\",…,\"x\" over \"A\" up to this equivalence relation is a Boolean algebra (and is canonically isomorphic to the set of \"A\"-definable subsets of \"M\"). The complete \"n\"-types correspond to ultrafilters of this boolean algebra. The set of complete \"n\"-types can be made into a topological space by taking the sets of types containing a given formula as basic open sets. This constructs the Stone space, which is compact, Hausdorff, and totally disconnected.\n\nExample. The complete theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0 has quantifier elimination, which allows one to show that the possible complete 1-types correspond to:\nIn other words, the 1-types correspond exactly to the prime ideals of the polynomial ring Q[\"x\"] over the rationals Q: if \"r\" is an element of the model of type \"p\", then the ideal corresponding to \"p\" is the set of polynomials with \"r\" as a root. More generally, the complete \"n\"-types correspond to the prime ideals of the polynomial ring Q[\"x\"...,\"x\"], in other words to the points of the prime spectrum of this ring. (The Stone space topology can in fact be viewed as the Zariski topology of a Boolean ring induced in a natural way from the lattice structure of the Boolean Algebra; while the Zariski topology is not in general Hausdorff, it is in the case of Boolean rings.) For example, if \"q\"(\"x\",\"y\") is an irreducible polynomial in 2 variables, there is a 2-type whose realizations are (informally) pairs (\"x\",\"y\") of transcendental elements with \"q\"(\"x\",\"y\")=0.\n\nGiven a complete \"n\"-type \"p\" one can ask if there is a model of the theory that omits \"p\", in other words there is no \"n\"-tuple in the model that realizes \"p\". \nIf \"p\" is an isolated point in the Stone space, i.e. if {\"p\"} is an open set, it is easy to see that every model realizes \"p\" (at least if the theory is complete). The omitting types theorem says that conversely if \"p\" is not isolated then there is a countable model omitting \"p\" (provided that the language is countable).\n\nExample: In the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0, there is a 1-type represented by elements that are transcendental over the prime field. This is a non-isolated point of the Stone space (in fact, the only non-isolated point). The field of algebraic numbers is a model omitting this type, and the algebraic closure of any \ntranscendental extension of the rationals is a model realizing this type.\n\nAll the other types are \"algebraic numbers\" (more precisely, they are the sets of first order statements satisfied by some given algebraic number), and all such types are realized in all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0.\n\n"}

In the United States this includes religion. It certainly encompasses the entire \"voluntary sector,\" but \"voluntary\" in the \"voluntarism\" context means not mandated by law (as government is). Many voluntary sector (nonprofit) agencies have a volunteer board because that is a legal requirement, but may not utilize volunteers in direct service in any way. There are subjects within \"voluntarism\" that have nothing to do with volunteers, such as Unrelated Business Income Tax legislation, proposal writing, and compensation law.\n\nVoluntary provision of services to religious, civil, medical, educational, environmental and other private or governmental organizations doubtless has a long history. Such volunteer efforts keep expenses down for non-profit and philanthropic organizations, empower individuals and groups to help others, and make volunteers feel needed.\n\nVoluntarism flourished in the 19th and early 20th centuries and was empowering especially to the women who had been excluded from political participation outside the home. Women’s organizations dealt with social problems created by rapid industrialization and urbanization, and by massive immigration which were not addressed by institutions of the time and had a great influence on American political culture.\n\nVoluntarism is also used to describe non-coercive methods of recruiting soldiers, from participants in European and American military service to youthful combatants in civil war in Sierra Leone.\n\nVoluntarism has been a phrase used in labor relations. In Britain, it means the state refrains from directly intervening in industrial relations. In the early American labor movement it meant trade unions should focus on \"pure and simple\" gains in wages and working conditions and not independent labor politics and industrial unionism.\n\nIn his book \"Willful Liberalism: Voluntarism and Individuality in Political Theory and Practice\", Johns Hopkins University political science professor Richard E. Flathman argues that liberals must understand more about individuality and self-reliance and self-responsibility and therefore be more open of acceptance of voluntary action and less concerned with ordering political society. He notes, \"Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all dispositions constantly form associations,\" which he describes as \"of a thousand other kinds, religious, moral, serious, futile, general or restricted, enormous or diminutive\".\n\nIn sociology, voluntarism is an important aspect of the action theory of Talcott Parsons, as well as other theories of social action and agency.\n\nVoluntaryists, free market advocates, libertarians and anarchists call for voluntary efforts to replace most or all government efforts, using both moral and utilitarian arguments.\n\nVoluntary provision of services to the religious, civil, medical, educational, environmental and other private or governmental organizations doubtless has a long history.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18606535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18606535", "title": "Will to live", "text": "Will to live\n\nThe will to life or \"Wille zum Leben\" is a psychological force to fight for self-preservation seen as an important and active process of conscious and unconscious reasoning. The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer is the first to give name to this force.\n\nThere are significant correlations between the will to live and existential, psychological, social, and physical sources of distress. The concept of the will to live can be seen as directly impacted by hope. Many, who overcome near-death experiences with no explanation, have described the will to live as a direct component of their survival. The difference between the wish to die versus the wish to live is also a unique risk factor for suicide.\n\nIn psychology, the will to live is the drive for self-preservation, usually coupled with expectations for future improvement in one's state in life. The will to live is an important concept when attempting to understand and comprehend why we do what we do in order to stay alive, and for as long as we can. This can be related to either one's push for survival on the brink of death, or someone who is just trying to find a meaning to continuing their life. Some researchers say that people who have a reason or purpose in life during such dreadful and horrific experiences will often appear to fare better than those that may find such experiences overwhelming. Everyday, people undergo countless types of negative experiences, some to which may be demoralizing, hurtful, or tragic. An ongoing question continues to be what keeps the will to live in these situations. Some people that claim to have experienced instances of the will to live, have many different explanations behind it.\n\nThe will to live is considered to be a very basic drive in humans; but not necessarily the main driving force. In psychotherapy, Sigmund Freud termed the pleasure principle, which is the seeking of pleasure and avoiding of pain. Viktor Frankl, after spending time in a German concentration camp, developed psychotherapy called logotherapy, or the \"will to meaning\". Maslow's hierarchy of needs highlights the innate appetite that people possess for love and belonging but before all this there is the very basic and powerful will to live.\nPsychologists have established that human beings are a goal-oriented species. In assessing the will to live, it should be borne in mind that it could be augmented or diminished by the relative strength of other simultaneously existent drives. Psychologists generally agree that there is the will to live, the will to pleasure, the will to superiority and the will to connection. There are also usually varying degrees of curiosity with regard to what may be termed the will to identity or establishing meaningful personal responses. The will to live is a platform without which it would not be possible to satisfy the other drives. However, this overlooks the possibility that there is a commonality among all creatures that drives all others urges. And that is the need to reproduce and ensure the preservation of the species.\n\nSelf-preservation is a behavior that ensures the survival of an organism. Pain and fear are integral parts of this mechanism. Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future. Most pain resolves promptly once the painful stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but sometimes pain persists despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body; and sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease. Fear causes the organism to seek safety and may cause a release of adrenaline, which has the effect of increased strength and heightened senses such as hearing, smell, and sight. Self-preservation may also be interpreted figuratively, in regard to the coping mechanisms one needs to prevent emotional trauma from distorting the mind (see: defence mechanism.)\n\nEven the most simple of living organisms (for example, the single-celled bacteria) are typically under intense selective pressure to evolve a response that would help avoid a damaging environment, if such an environment exists. Organisms also evolve while adapting - even thriving - in a benign environment (for example, a marine sponge modifies its structure in response to current changes, in order to better absorb and process nutrients). Self-preservation is therefore an almost universal hallmark of life. However, when introduced to a novel threat, many species will have a self-preservation response either too specialised, or not specialised enough, to cope with that particular threat. An example is the dodo, which evolved in the absence of natural predators and hence lacked an appropriate, general self-preservation response to heavy predation by humans and rats, showing no fear of them.\n\n“Existential, psychiatric, social, and, to a lesser degree, physical variables are highly correlated with the will to live”. Existential issues found to correlate significantly include hopelessness, the desire for death, sense of dignity, and burden to others. Psychiatric issues found to be strongly associated are such as depression, anxiety, and lack of concentration. Physical issues that showed the strongest associations were appetite and appearance which did not show the same consistent degree of correlation. The four main predictor variables of the will to live changing over time are anxiety, shortness of breath, depression, and sense of well-being which correlate with the other variable predictors as well. Social variables and quality of life measures are shown to correlate significantly with the will to live such as support and satisfaction with support from family, friends, and health care providers. Findings on the will to live have suggested that psychological variables are replaced by physical mediators of variation as death draws nearer. The will to live has also proven to be highly unstable.\n\nMany studies have been conducted on the theory of the will to live. Among these studies are subject to the difference in gender and the elderly and also in the terminally ill. One study focused on a simple question that asked about rating one’s will to live and presented the findings that elderly participants reporting a stronger will to live and strengthened or stable will to live survived longer in comparison to those with a weak will to live. This study found that women were able to cope with life-threatening situations, but suggested that the participants could not have been stable and requires future replication.\nThe second study presented the idea of the will to live in the terminally ill specifically cancer patients termed as older. In this study researchers were able to suggest that patients who had tested as having a low sustained will to live died soonest, as opposed to having a moderate level of the will to live, lived the longest while high will to live could affect individuals in any direction. This study needs future replication that can show the effects of will to live in the terminally ill from different diseases and age categories.\nOther accounts of the will to live exist in many extreme medical cases, where patients have overcome extraordinary odds to survive. The Holocaust has provided many instances of this phenomenon, and is a good example of this as well. A proposed mechanism for the will to live is the idea that positive mental thinking tends to lower one’s risk for disease and health complications. One study showed that women who thought positively were more likely to carry more antibodies against certain strains of the flu, thus having a stronger immune system than those who were told to think negative thoughts.\nPowerful examples of humans having a will to live can be seen in death records throughout history showing that people were more likely to die right after a major holiday, such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, and even birthdays, not actually on or before them, but passing shortly after.\n\n\n"}
