In the 1980s it became progressively clearer that the standard neoclassical exogenous growth models were theoretically unsatisfactory as tools to explore long run growth, as these models predicted economies without technological change and thus they would eventually converge to a steady state, with zero per capita growth. A fundamental reason for this is the diminishing return of capital; the key property of AK endogenous-growth model is the absence of diminishing returns to capital. In lieu of the diminishing returns of capital implied by the usual parameterizations of a Cobb–Douglas production function, the AK model uses a linear model where output is a linear function of capital. Its appearance in most textbooks is to introduce endogenous growth theory.\n\nIn neoclassical growth models the economy is assumed to reach a steady state in which all macroeconomic variables grow at the same rate and in the absence of technological progress, per capita growth of these macroeconomic variable will eventually cease. These kind of neoclassical prepositions have the resemblance with the philosophical contents in Ricardo and Malthus. The basic underlying assumption of neoclassical philosophical is that diminishing returns to capital operates in the production process.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s a new beginning of growth theory launched by Paul Romer in 1986, where he tried to explain the growth process in a different manner. Thus the dissatisfaction out of neoclassical model motivated to construct new growth theories where the key determination of growth theories are endogenous in the model as in these new theories, the long run growth is not determined by exogenous factors setting up endogenous growth theories.\n\nThe simplest version of endogenous model is AK models which assume constant exogenous saving rate and fixed level of technology. The stickiest assumption of this model is that production function does not include diminishing returns to capital. This means that with this strong assumption the model can lead to endogenous growth.\n\nThe AK model production function is a special case of a Cobb–Douglas function with constant returns to scale.\n\nThis equation shows a Cobb–Douglas function where \"Y\" represents the total production in an economy. \"A\" represents total factor productivity, \"K\" is capital, \"L\" is labor, and the parameter formula_2 measures the output elasticity of capital. For the special case in which formula_3, the production function becomes linear in capital and does not have the property of decreasing returns to scale in the capital stock, which would prevail for any other value of the capital intensity between 0 and 1.\n\nformula_4 = population growth rate<br>\nformula_5 = depreciation <br>\nformula_6 = capital per worker <br>\nformula_7 = output/income per worker<br>\nformula_8 = labor force <br>\nformula_9 = saving rate\n\nIn an alternative form formula_10, formula_11 embodies both physical capital and human capital.\n\nIn the above equation A is the level of technology which is positive constant and K represents volume of capital.\nHence, output per capita is:\n\nThe model implicitly assumes that the average product of capital is equal to marginal product of capital which is equivalent to:\n\nformula_15\n\nThe model again assumes that labor force is growing at a constant rate ‘n’ and there is no depreciation of capital. (δ = 0 )\nIn this case, the basic differential equation of neo-classical growth model would be:\n\nformula_16\n\nHence, formula_17\n\nBut in the model formula_18\n\nThus, formula_19\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4026045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4026045", "title": "Anomalous monism", "text": "Anomalous monism\n\nAnomalous monism is a philosophical thesis about the mind–body relationship. It was first proposed by Donald Davidson in his 1970 paper \"Mental Events\". The theory is twofold and states that mental events are identical with physical events, and that the mental is anomalous, i.e. under their mental descriptions, relationships between these mental events are not describable by strict physical laws. Hence, Davidson proposes an identity theory of mind without the reductive bridge laws associated with the type-identity theory. Since the publication of his paper, Davidson has refined his thesis and both critics and supporters of anomalous monism have come up with their own characterizations of the thesis, many of which appear to differ from Davidson's.\n\nConsidering views about the relation between the mental and the physical as distinguished first by whether or not mental entities are identical with physical entities, and second by whether or not there are strict psychophysical laws, we arrive at a fourfold classification: (1) nomological monism, which says there are strict correlating laws, and that the correlated entities are identical (this is usually called type physicalism); (2) nomological dualism, which holds that there are strict correlating laws, but that the correlated entities are not identical (parallelism and pre-established harmony); (3) anomalous dualism, which holds there are no laws correlating the mental and the physical, and that the substances are ontologically distinct (i.e. Cartesian dualism); and (4) anomalous monism, which allows only one class of entities, but denies the possibility of definitional and nomological reduction. Davidson put forth his theory of anomalous monism as a possible solution to the mind–body problem.\n\nSince (in this theory) every mental event is some physical event or other, the idea is that someone's thinking at a certain time, for example, that snow is white, is a certain pattern of neural firing in their brain at that time, an event which can be characterized as both a thinking that snow is white (a type of mental event) and a pattern of neural firing (a type of physical event). There is just one event that can be characterized both in mental terms and in physical terms. If mental events are physical events, they can at least in principle be explained and predicted, like all physical events, on the basis of laws of physical science. However, according to anomalous monism, events cannot be so explained or predicted as described in mental terms (such as \"thinking\", \"desiring\" etc.), but only as described in physical terms: this is the distinctive feature of the thesis as a brand of physical monism.\n\nDavidson makes an argument for his version of non-reductive physicalism. The argument relies on the following three principles:\n\nThe first principle follows from Davidson's view of the ontology of events and the nature of the relationship of mental events (specifically propositional attitudes) with physical actions. Davidson subscribes to an ontology of events where events (as opposed to objects or states of affairs) are the fundamental, irreducible entities of the mental and physical universe. His original position, as expressed in \"Actions and Events\", was that event-individuation must be done on the basis of causal powers. He later abandoned this view in favour of the individuation of events on the basis of spatio-temporal localization, but his principle of causal interaction seems to imply some sort of, at least, implicit commitment to causal individuation. According to this view, all events are caused by and cause other events and this is the chief, defining characteristic of what an event is.\n\nAnother relevant aspect of Davidson's ontology of events for anomalous monism is that an event has an indefinite number of properties or aspects. An event such as \"the turning on of the light-switch\" is not fully described in the words of that particular phrase. Rather, \"the turning on of the light-switch\" also involves \"the illumination of the room\", \"the alerting of the burglar in the kitchen\", etc... Since a physical event, such as the action of turning on the light-switch can be associated with a very large variety of mental events (reasons) which are potentially capable of rationalizing the action \"a posteriori\", how is it possible to choose the real cause of my turning on the light-switch (which event is the causal one)? Davidson says that the causal event, in such a case, is the particular reason that \"caused\" the action to occur. It was because I wanted to see better that I turned on the light-switch and not because I wanted to alert the burglar in the kitchen. The latter is just a sort of side effect. So, for Davidson, \"reasons are causes\" and this explains the causal efficacy of the mental.\n\nThe principle of the nomological character of causality (or cause-law principle) requires that events be covered by so-called strict laws. Davidson originally assumed the validity of this principle but, in more recent years, he felt the need to provide a logical justification for it. So what is\na strict law?\n\nWhenever a particular event E1 is causally related to a second particular event E2, there must be, according to Davidson, a law such that (\"C1\" & \"D1\") -> \"D2\", where \"C1\" represents a set of preliminary conditions, \"D1\" is a description of E1 which is sufficient, given \"C1\", for an occurrence of an event of the kind \"D2\", which represents the description of E2. The cause-law principle was intended by Davidson to take in both laws of temporal succession as well as bridge laws. Since Davidson denies that any such laws can involve psychological predicates (including such laws as \"(M1 & M2) -> M3\" wherein the predicates are all psychological or mixed laws such as ((M1 & M2 -> P1) and ((P1 & P2 -> M1))), it follows that such bridge laws as \"P1 -> M1\", \"M1 -> P1\" or \"M1 if and only if P1\" are to be excluded.\n\nHowever, mental predicates may be allowed in what are called \"hedged laws\" which are just strict laws qualified by \"ceteris paribus\" (all other things being equal) clauses. What this means is that while the generalization ((M1 & M2 -> P1) is justifiable \"ceteris paribus\", it cannot be fully elaborated in terms of, e.g., (P2 & P3 & M1 & M2 & M3) -> P1.\n\nDavidson defended the cause-law principle by revising Curt John Ducasse's (1926) attempt to define singular causal relations without appealing to covering laws. Ducasse's account of cause was based on the notion of change. Some particular event \"C\" is the cause of some effect \"E\" if and only if \"C\" was the only change that occurred in the immediate environment of \"E\" just prior to the occurrence of \"E\". So, for example, the striking of a match is the cause of the flaming of the match to the extent that the striking is the only change that occurs in the immediate vicinity of the match.\n\nDavidson turns this around and asks if it is not the case that our notions of change do not, rather, appeal to a foundation of laws. Davidson first observes that 'change' is just shorthand for 'change of predicate', in that a change occurs when and only when a predicate that is true (false) of some object later becomes false (true) of that object. Second, and more importantly, the notion of change has itself changed over time: under Newtonian physics, continuous motion counts as change but not in Aristotelian physics. Hence, it could be argued that what we view as change is theory-dependent and presupposes a background notion of laws. Since change is fundamental to the concept of cause and change is dependent on laws, it follows that cause is also dependent on laws.\n\nThe third principle requires a different justification. It suggests that the mental cannot be linked up with the physical in a chain of psycho-physical laws such that mental events can be predicted and explained on the basis of such laws. This principle arises out of two further doctrines which Davidson espoused throughout his life: the normativity of the mental and semantic holism.\n\nPropositional attitude ascriptions are subject to the constraints of rationality and, so, in ascribing one belief to an individual, I must also ascribe to him all of the beliefs which are logical consequences of that ascription. All of this is in accordance with the principle of charity, according to which we must \"try for a theory that finds him consistent, a believer of truths, and a lover of the good\" (Davidson 1970). But we can never have all the possible evidence for the ascription of mental states for they are subject to the indeterminacy of translation and there is an enormous amount of subjectivity involved in the process. On the other hand, physical processes are deterministic and descriptive rather than normative. Therefore, their base of evidence is closed and law-governed.\n\nVincenzo Fano provides an illustration of the point that holism of the mental generates anomalism. Fano asks us to first consider the attribution of length to a table. To do this, we must assume a set of laws concerning the interaction between the table and the measuring apparatus: the length of the table doesn't vary significantly during the measurement, length must be an additive quantity, \"longer than\" must be an asymmetric, transitive relation and so forth. By assuming these laws and carrying out a few operations, we reach the result of the measurement. There is a certain amount of holism in this process. For example, during the measurement process, we might discover that the table is much hotter than the measuring device, in which case the length of the latter will have been modified by the contact. Consequently, we need to modify the temperature of the measuring device. In some cases, we will even have to reconsider and revise some of our laws. This process can continue for some time until we are fairly confident of the results obtained. But it is not only necessary to have a theory of the interactions between the table and the measuring device, it is also necessary to attribute a set of predicates to the table: a certain temperature, rigidity, electric charge, etc... And the attribution of each of these predicates presupposes, in turn, another theory. So, the attribution of \"F\" to \"x\" presupposes \"Px\" and the theory formula_1, but \"Px\", in turn, presupposes \"P'x\" and formula_2 and so on. As a result, we have a series of predicates \"F\", \"P\", formula_3, formula_4... and a series of theories formula_5, formula_2, formula_7... As Fano states it, \"this process would seem like a \"regressus ad infinitum\", if it weren't that formula_8 converges toward a theory \"T\" which is nothing other than physics in its entirety.\" The same is true of the predicates, which converge toward the set of all the possible physical quantities. Fano calls this 'convergent holism'.\n\nHe asks us to then consider the attribution of a belief. We are seeking a good scientific theory of amorous relations. We ask ourselves if Thomas, who has recently been betrayed by his girlfriend Ffion, believes that it is possible that the relationship can continue. The way we can find out the answer to this question is simply by asking Thomas if he believes it is possible. Thomas says no. Does this authorize us to attribute to Thomas the belief that the relationship cannot continue? Of course not, since Thomas is probably angry and confuses his desire to break up with Ffion with his beliefs. So we ask him if he is angry with Ffion. He says that he is, but we cannot attribute to him the belief that the relationship \"can\" continue, because we don't really know if he's confusing his desires with his beliefs or vice versa. So now we ask Thomas if he will still retain the same opinion next month. Thomas pauses for a while and then says yes. At this point, we think we have a definitive confirmation of the fact that Thomas believes that the relation must be interrupted, since he reflected on the matter before answering. Just to be sure, we ask him what came to mind during that interval of reflection. Thomas answers that he thought of all the unhappy incidents between that took place between him and Ffion. So we return to our original hypothesis on the basis that Thomas is angry and therefore confuses his desires and his beliefs.\n\nHow can all this be formalized? At the beginning, we attributed the predicate \"no\" to Thomas as a direct response to our question. This is a physical predicate \"F\". We can call the attribution of Thomas' belief that the relationship cannot continue \"m\". From \"Fx\", we cannot deduce \"mx\". On the basis of the hypothesis that a person who is angry is not capable of examining their own opinions clearly, we asked Thomas if he was angry. We ascribed to him the mental predicate \"m1\" and the physical predicate \"F1\" (the answer \"yes\" to the question whether he is angry). Now, we can deduce \"m1\" (the fact that he is angry) from \"F1\". But from \"m1\" and \"F1\", we can deduce neither \"m\" (the fact that Thomas believes the relationship cannot continue) nor \"not m\". So we continue by attributing the next physical predicate \"F2\" (the positive answer to our question whether he will be of the same opinion in one month).\n\nFrom \"F2\", \"F1\" and \"m1\", we would like to deduce \"not m\". But we weren't sure what Thomas was thinking about during his pause, so we asked him to tell us and, on the basis of this response \"F3\", we deduce \"m2\" (that Thomas confuses his desires with his beliefs). And so on ad infinitum. The conclusion is that the holism of the mental is non-convergent and therefore it is anomalous with respect to the physical.\n\nSo how are the three seemingly irreconcilable principles above resolved? Davidson distinguishes causal relations, which are an extensional matter and not influenced by the way they are described, from law-like relations, which are intensional and dependent on the manner of description. There is no law of nature under which events fall when they are described according to the order in which they appeared on the television news. When the earthquake caused the Church of Santa Maria dalla Chiesa to collapse, there is surely some physical law(s) which explains what happened, but not under the description in terms of the event on Channel 7 at six p.m. causing the events on Channel 8 at six fifteen. In the same way, mental and physical events are causally related but not \"qua\" mental events. The mental events have explanatory predicates which are physical as well as predicates which are irreducibly mental. Hence, AM is a form of predicate dualism which accompanies ontological monism.\n\nFinally, for those who objected that this is not really a form of physicalism because there is no assurance that every mental event will have a physical base, Davidson formulated the thesis of supervenience. Mental properties are dependent on physical properties and there can be no change in higher-level properties without a corresponding change in lower-level properties.\n\nTed Honderich has challenged the thesis of anomalous monism, forcing, in his words, the \"inventor of anomalous monism to think again\". To understand Honderich's argument, it is helpful to describe the example he uses to illustrate the thesis of AM itself: the event of two pears being put on a scale causes the event of the scale's moving to the two-pound mark. But if we describe the event as \"the two French and green things caused the scale to move to the two-pound mark\", then while this is true, there is no lawlike relation between the greenness and Frenchness of the pears and the pointers moving to the two-pound mark.\n\nHonderich then points out that what we are really doing when we say that there is \"no lawlike relationship between two things under certain descriptions\" is taking certain properties and noting that the two things are not in relation in virtue of those particular properties. But this does not mean they are not in lawlike relation in virtue of certain other properties, such as weight in the pears example. On this basis, we can formulate the generalization that Honderich calls 'the Nomological Character of Causally-Relevant Properties'. Then we ask what the causally relevant properties of the mental events which cause physical events are.\n\nSince Davidson believes that mental events are causally efficacious (i.e. he rejects epiphenomenalism), then it must be a mental event as such (mental properties of mental events) which are the causally relevant properties. But if we accept the first two claims of the argument for AM, along with the idea of the causal efficacy of the mental, and the Principle of Causally-Relevant properties, then the result is a denial of anomalous monism because there are indeed psycho-physical lawlike connections. On the other hand, if we wish to retain the principle of the anomalism of the mental then we must reject causal efficacy and embrace epiphenomenalism.\n\nDavidson has responded to such arguments by reformulating anomalous monism and has defended the improved version in \"Thinking Causes\". He points out that the defect in the so-called epiphenominalism problem lies in its confusion of the concept \"by virtue of\" (or necessary for) with the idea of an event's being responsible for another. Also, Honderich's example of the pears and the scale is jerry rigged in such a way that only a single effect is taken into consideration: the alteration on the scale. But the action of placing pears on a scale can have many different effects; it can attract the attention of a customer, for example. In this case, the causally relevant properties would be precisely the color, shape and other \"irrelevant\" properties of the fruit. What is relevant or irrelevant therefore depends, in part, on the context of explanatory interest.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is found on the outside walls of Tibetan Buddhist temples and monasteries in the Indo-Tibetan region, to help ordinary people understand Buddhist teachings.\n\n\"Bhavachakra\", \"wheel of life,\" consists of the words \"bhava\" and \"cakra\".\n\n\"Bhava\" (भव) means \"being, worldly existence, becoming, birth, be, production, origin\".\n\nThe Sanskrit word \"bhāva\" (भाव) is rooted in the term \"bhava\", and means \"emotion, sentiment, state of body or mind, disposition.\" In some contexts it also means \"becoming, being, existing, occurring, appearance\" while connoting the condition thereof.\n\nIn Buddhism, \"bhava\" denotes the continuity of becoming (reincarnating) in one of the realms of existence, in the samsaric context of rebirth, life and the maturation arising therefrom. It is the tenth of the Twelve Nidanas, in its \"Pratītyasamutpāda\" doctrine.\n\nThe word \"Chakra\" (चक्र) derives from the Sanskrit word meaning \"wheel,\" as well as \"circle\" and \"cycle\".\n\nThe word \"chakra\" is used to mean several different things in the Sanskrit sources:\n\nLegend has it that the historical Buddha himself created the first depiction of the bhavacakra, and the story of how he gave the illustration to King Rudrāyaṇa appears in the anthology of Buddhist narratives called the \"Divyāvadāna\".\n\nThe \"bhavacakra\" is painted on the outside walls of nearly every Tibetan Buddhist temple in Tibet and India, to instruct non-monastic audience about the Buddhist teachings.\n\nThe \"bhavacakra\" consists of the following elements: \n\nSymbolically, the three inner circles, moving from the center outward, show that the three poisons of ignorance, attachment, and aversion give rise to positive and negative actions; these actions and their results are called karma. Karma in turn gives rise to the six realms, which represent the different types of suffering within samsara.\n\nThe fourth and outer layer of the wheel symbolizes the twelve links of dependent origination; these links indicate \"how\" the sources of suffering—the three poisons and karma—produce lives within cyclic existence.\n\nThe fierce being holding the wheel represents impermanence; this symbolizes that the entire process of samsara or cyclic existence is impermanent, transient, constantly changing. The moon above the wheel indicates liberation. The Buddha is pointing to the moon, indicating that liberation from samsara is possible.\n\nIn the hub of the wheel are three animals: a pig, a snake, and a bird. They represent the three poisons of ignorance, aversion, and attachment, respectively. The pig stands for ignorance; this comparison is based on the Indian concept of a pig being the most foolish of animals, since it sleeps in the dirtiest places and eats whatever comes to its mouth. The snake represents aversion or anger; this is because it will be aroused and strike at the slightest touch. The bird represents attachment (also translated as \"desire\" or \"clinging\"). The particular bird used in this diagram represents an Indian bird that is very attached to its partner. These three animals represent the three poisons, which are the core of the bhavacakra. From these three poisons, the whole cycle of existence evolves.\n\nIn many drawings of the wheel, the snake and bird are shown as coming out of the mouth of the pig, indicating that aversion and attachment arise from ignorance. The snake and bird are also shown grasping the tail of the pig, indicating that they in turn promote greater ignorance.\n\nUnder the influence of the three poisons, beings create karma, as shown in the next layer of the circle.\n\nThe second layer of the wheel shows two-half circles:\n\nThese images represent karma, the law of cause and effect. The light half-circle indicates people experiencing the results of positive actions. The dark half-circle indicates people experiencing the results of negative actions.\n\nRingu Tulku states:\n\nPropelled by their karma, beings take rebirth in the six realms of samsara, as shown in the next layer of the circle.\n\nThe third layer of the wheel is divided into six sections that represent the six realms of samsara, or cyclic existence, the process of cycling through one rebirth after another. These six realms are divided into three higher realms and three lower realms. The wheel can also be represented as having five realms, combining the God realm and the Demi-god realm into a single realm.\n\nThe three higher realms are shown in the top half of the circle:\n\nThe three lower realms are shown in the bottom half of the circle:\n\nAmong the six realms, the human realm is considered to offer the best opportunity to practice the dharma. In some representations of the wheel, there is a buddha or bodhisattva depicted within each realm, trying to help sentient beings find their way to nirvana.\n\nThe outer rim of the wheel is divided into twelve sections that represent the Twelve Nidānas. As previously stated, the three inner layers of the wheel show that the three poisons lead to karma, which leads to the suffering of the six realms. The twelve links of the outer rim show \"how\" this happens—by presenting the process of cause and effect in detail.\n\nThese twelve links can be understood to operate on an outer or inner level. \n\nBy contemplating on the twelve links, one gains greater insight into the workings of karma; this insight enables us to begin to unravel our habitual way of thinking and reacting.\n\nThe twelve causal links, paired with their corresponding symbols, are: \n\nThe wheel is being held by a fearsome figure who represents impermanence.\n\nThis figure is often interpreted as being Mara, the demon who tried to tempt the Buddha, or as Yama, the lord of death. Regardless of the figure depicted, the inner meaning remains the same–that the entire process of cyclic existence (samsara) is transient; everything within this wheel is constantly changing.\n\nYama has the following attributes:\n\nAbove the wheel is an image of the moon; the moon represents liberation from the sufferings of samsara. Some drawings may show an image of a \"pure land\" to indicate liberation, rather than a moon.\n\nThe upper part of the drawing also shows an image of the Buddha pointing toward the moon; this represents the path to liberation. While in Theravada Buddhism this is the Noble Eightfold Path, in Mahayana Buddhism this is the Bodhisattva path, striving to liberation for all sentient beings. In Tibetan Buddhism, this is Lamrim, which details all the stages on the path, while Zen has its own complicated history of the entanglement of meditation practice and direct insight.\n\nDrawings of the Bhavacakra usually contain an inscription consisting of a few lines of text that explain the process that keeps us in samara and how to reverse that process.\n\nThe Theravada-tradition does not have a graphical representation of the round of rebirths, but cakra-symbolism is an elementary component of Buddhism, and Buddhaghosa's \"Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga)\" contains such imagery:\nSome western interpreters take a psychological point of view, explaining that different karmic actions contribute to one's metaphorical existence in different realms, or rather, different actions reinforce personal characteristics described by the realms. According to Mark Epstein, \"each realm becomes not so much a specific place but rather a metaphor for a different psychological state, with the entire wheel becoming a representation of neurotic suffering.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1058899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1058899", "title": "Binary opposition", "text": "Binary opposition\n\nA nebular opposition (also binary system) is a pair of related terms or concepts that are opposite in meaning. Binary opposition is the system by which language and thought, two theoretical opposites are strictly defined and set off against one another. It is the contrast between two mutually exclusive terms, such as on and off, up and down, left and right. Binary opposition is an important concept of structuralism, which sees such distinctions as fundamental to all language and thought. In structuralism, a binary opposition is seen as a fundamental organizer of human philosophy, culture, and language.\n\nBinary opposition originated in Saussurean structuralist theory. According to Ferdinand de Saussure, the binary opposition is the means by which the units of language have value or meaning; each unit is defined in reciprocal determination with another term, as in binary code. It is not a contradictory relation but a structural, complementary one. Saussure demonstrated that a sign's meaning is derived from its context (syntagmatic dimension) and the group (paradigm) to which it belongs. An example of this is that one cannot conceive of 'good' if we do not understand 'evil'.\n\nTypically, one of the two opposites assumes a role of dominance over the other. The categorization of binary oppositions is \"often value-laden and ethnocentric\", with an illusory order and superficial meaning. Furthermore, Pieter Fourie discovered that binary oppositions have a deeper or second level of binaries that help to reinforce meaning. As an example, the concepts \"hero\" and \"villain\" involve secondary binaries: good/bad, handsome/ugly, liked/disliked, and so on.\n\nA classic example of a binary opposition is the presence-absence dichotomy. In much of Western thought, including structuralism, distinguishing between presence and absence, viewed as polar opposites, is a fundamental element of thought in many cultures. In addition, according to post-structuralist criticisms, \"presence\" occupies a position of dominance in Western thought over \"absence\", because \"absence\" is traditionally seen as what you get when you take away \"presence\". (Had \"absence\" been dominant, \"presence\" might have most naturally been seen as what you get when you take away an \"absence\".) \n\nAccording to Nasser Maleki, there is another example of this phenomenon whereby people value one part of a binary opposition over another; “we, as living in a certain culture, think and act similarly in situations when we want to pick out one of the concepts in the binary oppositions or while seeking truth or a center. For example, we give superiority to life rather than death.” This suggests that the cultural setting a reader is a part of may influence their interpretation of a work of literature; “only one concept, from the binary opposition, is ready, in our mind, to be privileged and the other one is usually put aside as having the second priority.” He reached this conclusion by giving a name to the shared western unconsciousness for a preferred binary concept - logocentrism. This is the belief that “an ultimate reality or centre of truth exists and that can serve as the basis for all our thought and actions. This might imply that readers might unconsciously take side with one concept of binary opposition, and Derrida traces this reaction as a cultural phenomenon.” \n\nAccording to Jacques Derrida, meaning in the West is defined in terms of binary oppositions, “a violent hierarchy” where “one of the two terms governs the other.” Within the white/ black binary opposition in the United States, the African American is defined as a devalued other.\n\nAn example of a binary opposition is the male-female dichotomy. A post-structuralist view is that \"male\" can be seen, according to traditional Western thought, as dominant over \"female\" because \"male\" is the presence of a phallus, while the vagina is an absence or loss. John Searle has suggested that the concept of binary oppositions—as taught and practiced by postmodernists and poststructuralist—is specious and lacking in rigor.\n\nThe political (rather than analytic or conceptual) critique of binary oppositions is an important part of third wave feminism, post-colonialism, post-anarchism, and critical race theory, which argue that the perceived binary dichotomy between man/woman, civilized/uncivilised, and white/black have perpetuated and legitimized Western power structures favoring \"civilized white men.\" In the last fifteen years it has become routine for many social and/or historical analyses to address the variables of gender, class, sexuality, race and ethnicity. Within each of these categories there is usually an unequal binary opposition: bourgeoisie/working class man; white/people of colour; men/women; heterosexual/homosexual.\n\nPost-structural criticism of binary oppositions is not simply the reversal of the opposition, but its deconstruction, which is described as apolitical—that is, not intrinsically favoring one arm of a binary opposition over the other. Deconstruction is the \"event\" or \"moment\" at which a binary opposition is thought to contradict itself, and undermine its own authority.\n\nDeconstruction assumes that all binary oppositions need to be analyzed and criticized in all their manifestations; the function of both logical and axiological oppositions must be studied in all discourses that provide meaning and values. But deconstruction does not only expose how oppositions work and how meaning and values are produced in a nihilistic or cynic position, \"thereby preventing any means of intervening in the field effectively\". To be effective, and simply as its mode of practice, deconstruction creates new notions or concepts, not to synthesize the terms in opposition but to mark their difference, undecidability, and eternal interplay.\n\nLogocentrism is an idea related to binary opposition that suggests certain audiences will favour one part of a binary opposition pair over the other. This favouritism is often most strongly influenced by a readers' cultural background. The strong patriarchal themes in 'The Women and the Pot', an Amharic folktale, would be one such example of logocentrism. This tells the story of two women who are upset at their diminished role in society, and who consequently go to their King for help. He effectively conveys the message that women cannot be relied upon to take on a greater role in society, which becomes the moral of the tale. Prasad explains this idea; “The logocentric value is seen through the 'Eternal Knowledge' – the naturalness of male superiority – that is conveyed through the folktale. The hidden a priori binary opposition is 'Man over Woman'.” In relation to the cultural heritage of an audience having an influence on their unconscious preference for one part of a binary opposition, Prasad says; “By way of studying a selection of Ethiopian folktales, the paper uncovers the presence of logocentrism and a priori binary opposition being at work in Ethiopian folktales. These two elements attempt to endorse and validate the 'given' subservient position of women in society”.\n\nBinary opposition is deeply embedded within literature as language, and paired opposites, rely upon a relation with adjoining words inside a paradigmatic chain. If one of the paired opposites were removed the other’s precise meaning would be altered. In addition, binary opposition was explored in children’s literature and it was found that authors were reinforcing Westernized images and philosophies of feminism via the binary hierarchy. Western authors were creating a representation of non-Western countries based on colonial discourse, using binary oppositions to categorize human behaviour into one term or another – not both. The non-Western woman, therefore, was “the opposite or ‘other’ to women and girls from the West”.\n\n"}

It uses the pattern of citations, links from one document to another document, to reveal properties of the documents. A typical aim would be to identify the most important documents in a collection. A classic example is that of the citations between academic articles and books. The judgements produced by judges of law to support their decisions refer back to judgements made in earlier cases so citation analysis in a legal context is important. Another example is provided by patents which contain prior art, citation of earlier patents relevant to the current claim.\n\nDocuments can be associated with many other features in addition to citations, such as authors, publishers, journals as well as their actual texts. The general analysis of collections of documents is known as bibliometrics and citation analysis is a key part of that field. For example, bibliographic coupling and co-citation are association measures based on citation analysis (shared citations or shared references). The citations in a collection of documents can also be represented in forms such as a citation graph, as pointed out by Derek J. de Solla Price in his 1965 article \"Networks of Scientific Papers\". This means that citation analysis draws on aspects of social network analysis and network science.\n\nAn early example of automated citation indexing was CiteSeer, which was used for citations between academic papers, while Google Scholar is an example of a modern system which includes more than just academic books and articles reflecting a wider range of information sources. Today, automated citation indexing has changed the nature of citation analysis research, allowing millions of citations to be analyzed for large-scale patterns and knowledge discovery. Citation analysis tools can be used to compute various impact measures for scholars based on data from citation indices. These have various applications, from the identification of expert referees to review papers and grant proposals, to providing transparent data in support of academic merit review, tenure, and promotion decisions. This competition for limited resources may lead to ethical questionable behavior to increase citations.\n\nA great deal of criticism has been made of the practice of naively using citation analyses to compare the impact of different scholarly articles without taking into account other factors which may affect citation patterns. Among these criticisms, a recurrent one focuses on “field-dependent factors”, which refers to the fact that citation practices vary from one area of science to another, and even between fields of research within a discipline.\n\nWhile citation indexes were originally designed for information retrieval, they are increasingly used for bibliometrics and other studies involving research evaluation. Citation data is also the basis of the popular journal impact factor.\n\nThere is a large body of literature on citation analysis, sometimes called scientometrics, a term invented by Vasily Nalimov, or more specifically bibliometrics. The field blossomed with the advent of the Science Citation Index, which now covers source literature from 1900 on. The leading journals of the field are \"Scientometrics,\" \"Informetrics,\" and the \"Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology\". ASIST also hosts an electronic mailing list called SIGMETRICS at ASIST. This method is undergoing a resurgence based on the wide dissemination of the Web of Science and Scopus subscription databases in many universities, and the universally available free citation tools such as CiteBase, CiteSeerX, Google Scholar, and the former Windows Live Academic (now available with extra features as Microsoft Academic). Methods of citation analysis research include qualitative, quantitative and computational approaches. The main foci of such scientometric studies have included productivity comparisons, institutional research rankings, journal rankings establishing faculty productivity and tenure standards, assessing the influence of top scholarly articles, tracing the development trajectory of a science or technology field, and developing profiles of top authors and institutions in terms of research performance.\n\nLegal citation analysis is a citation analysis technique for analyzing legal documents to facilitate the understanding of the inter-related regulatory compliance documents by the exploration the citations that connect provisions to other provisions within the same document or between different documents. Legal citation analysis uses a citation graph extracted from a regulatory document, which could supplement E-discovery - a process that leverages on technological innovations in big data analytics.\n\nIn a 1965 paper, Derek J. de Solla Price described the inherent linking characteristic of the SCI as \"Networks of Scientific Papers\". The links between citing and cited papers became dynamic when the SCI began to be published online. The Social Sciences Citation Index became one of the first databases to be mounted on the Dialog system in 1972. With the advent of the CD-ROM edition, linking became even easier and enabled the use of bibliographic coupling for finding related records. In 1973, Henry Small published his classic work on Co-Citation analysis which became a self-organizing classification system that led to document clustering experiments and eventually an \"Atlas of Science\" later called \"Research Reviews\".\n\nThe inherent topological and graphical nature of the worldwide citation network which is an inherent property of the scientific literature was described by Ralph Garner (Drexel University) in 1965.\n\nThe use of citation counts to rank journals was a technique used in the early part of the nineteenth century but the systematic ongoing measurement of these counts for scientific journals was initiated by Eugene Garfield at the Institute for Scientific Information who also pioneered the use of these counts to rank authors and papers. In a landmark paper of 1965 he and Irving Sher showed the correlation between citation frequency and eminence in demonstrating that Nobel Prize winners published five times the average number of papers while their work was cited 30 to 50 times the average. In a long series of essays on the Nobel and other prizes Garfield reported this phenomenon. The usual summary measure is known as impact factor, the number of citations to a journal for the previous two years, divided by the number of articles published in those years. It is widely used, both for appropriate and inappropriate purposes—in particular, the use of this measure alone for ranking authors and papers is therefore quite controversial.\n\nIn an early study in 1964 of the use of Citation Analysis in writing the history of DNA, Garfield and Sher demonstrated the potential for generating historiographs, topological maps of the most important steps in the history of scientific topics. This work was later automated by E. Garfield, A. I. Pudovkin of the Institute of Marine Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences and V. S. Istomin of Center for Teaching, Learning, and Technology, Washington State University and led to the creation of the HistCite software around 2002.\n\nAutomatic citation indexing was introduced in 1998 by Lee Giles, Steve Lawrence and Kurt Bollacker and enabled automatic algorithmic extraction and grouping of citations for any digital academic and scientific document. Where previous citation extraction was a manual process, citation measures could now scale up and be computed for any scholarly and scientific field and document venue, not just those selected by organizations such as ISI. This led to the creation of new systems for public and automated citation indexing, the first being CiteSeer (now CiteSeerX, soon followed by Cora, which focused primarily on the field of computer science and information science. These were later followed by large scale academic domain citation systems such as the Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic. Such autonomous citation indexing is not yet perfect in citation extraction or citation clustering with an error rate estimated by some at 10% though a careful statistical sampling has yet to be done. This has resulted in such authors as Ann Arbor, Milton Keynes, and Walton Hall being credited with extensive academic output. SCI claims to create automatic citation indexing through purely programmatic methods. Even the older records have a similar magnitude of error.\n\nCitation analysis for legal documents is an approach to facilitate the understanding and analysis of inter-related regulatory compliance documents by exploration of the citations that connect provisions to other provisions within the same document or between different documents. Citation analysis uses a citation graph extracted from a regulatory document, which could supplement E-discovery - a process that leverages on technological innovations in big data analytics.\n\nE-publishing. Due to the unprecedented growth of electronic resource (e-resource) availability, one of the questions currently being explored is, \"how often are e-resources being cited in my field?\" For instance, there are claims that on-line access to computer science literature leads to higher citation rates, however, humanities articles may suffer if not in print.\n\nSelf-citations. It has been criticized that authors game the system by accumulating citations by citing themselves excessively.<ref name=\"10.1007/s11192-017-2330-1\"></ref> For instance, it has been found that men tend to cite themselves more often than women.\n\n"}
{"id": "1128429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1128429", "title": "Class analysis", "text": "Class analysis\n\nClass analysis is research in sociology, politics and economics from the point of view of the stratification of the society into dynamic classes. It implies that there is no universal or uniform social outlook, rather that there are fundamental conflicts that exist inherent to how society is currently organized.\n\nMost known examples are the theory of Karl Marx and Max Weber's three-component theory of stratification.\n\nIn a non-Marxist sense, class analysis is a theory of political development, in which political regimes and systems are said to be shaped by the social class structure of the country. The main advocate for this theory is political scientist Barrington Moore Jr. In Moore's theory, Great Britain gradually attained a stable democratic governance, compared to neighboring countries such as France and Germany, due to the rapid displacement of peasantry during the enclosure movement which fully transformed Britain into an advanced, industrial society with a strong bourgeois class, which Moore sees as indispensable for a lasting liberal democracy. In contrast, France had a large peasantry that is stationary on land yet politically volatile, leading to the alternating between violent revolutions and monarchical reactions.\n\nSociologist Erik Olin Wright splits class analysis into a macro and micro level. The foundation of class analysis on a macro level can be identified with class structure. Examples of such class structure in a macro level can be analyzed within a firm, city, country, or the entire world. On a micro level, class analysis focuses on the effects that the class may have on an individual. Erik Olin Wright exclaims examples of this to be: \"Analyses of labor market strategies of unskilled workers, or the effects of technological change on class consciousness, or political contributions of corporate executives\". Macro and Micro level events can correlate with one another through different perspectives. Wright proclaims that Macro level events are not created and set on one large effect, but instead processed through multiple individuals in a very intricate and complex pattern. He dictates that Macro class size events are endorsed by an embodiment of multiple micro class events. He also states the opposite effect each size has on each other and how Micro level events relative to class relations can be reinforced by the context of macro level events.\n\nAccording to Richard Breen, Weber first begins to describe class analysis with the class situation of the capital market an individual lives in. He proclaims that members of the same social class share the same life chances They also develop under the same market which procures chances and limits according to the resources the individual and/or class provides to it. He also states that the individuals who understand the broad range of options a chance may give them, may also be given more opportunities by the market or be willing to share among the individuals respected class. Breen debriefs Weber's classification of social and how Weber classifies these classes not only through a social filter but by a grander economic one as well. He also makes note that social and economic mobility are a great key to the understanding class analysis. Here he dictates that although it is easier and more fluid to traverse through the social class, it is much more difficult to progress through the economic class, and a great big limiter is a social class the individual is located in. These results in limited chances by the market and is a great big factor in why class immobility occurs. Weber defines economic classes according to his time as: \"'dominant entrepreneurial and propertied groups'; the petty bourgeoisie; workers with formal credentials (the middle class) and those who lack them and whose only asset is their labor power (the working class).\"\n\nSociologist John Goldthorpe explains that while educational attainment in developed countries has risen in the last decades due to endorsements of grants, loans and other social motivations, empirical data substantiates that the differentials in social-economic class still plays a major role in educational and economic attainment. He goes on to explain how people of lower social class tend to stay in the class of their upbringing by choosing to not pursue further educational attainment or the works needed to attain a better social status. Explanations for these phenomena include theories by Halsey and her associates, which state the connection between culture and class, how people of high social class or paramount culture set a more important objective on education compared to parents of lower classes. According to Goldthorpe, a more aggressive approach, as indicated by Bourdieu and Passeron, indicates that the educational system functions as a social control, in which dominant class enforce that schools run in a conservative manner and exploit the inequalities that come with every child due to their family's class background. This will ensure subjects of lower class status to accept failure or indulge in counter-school subcultures. Goldthorpe, however, states that in the last century there has truly been extensive opportunities for upward educational and class mobility defended by means of empirical data.\n\nOther theories proposed by different sociologists arise as well. One view claimed by Keller and Zavalloni indicate that to better understand these trends, sociologists must study the aspirations of an individual on a relative level according to their social level and situation and not conclude absolute ideals of aspirations to all the classes, which would be easier to work with. Goldthorpe also acknowledges Boudon's two-effect view in educational attainment. Those stand as the primary effects, which exist as the creation of class differentials in initial achievement, and second effects that affect children when they transition in the educational system. They both work hand in hand were although initial achievement might pursue an individual as they develop in the educational system (Primary), choosing whether to transition into the next level in the system might still be influenced by their class origins (second). Goldthorpe goes on to encourage researchers to enforce further attention to the second effect, because as we progress, even today, the limitations of the primary effects seem to be vanishing as more educational attainment resources and opportunities are being funneled into all class levels.\n\nGoldthorpe describes how class influence on an individual's social situation is diminishing substantially in the world of politics. This evidently described by Sociologist M. Lipset during the latter half of the 20th century were liberal democratic working class advocated for their party to represent their problems In the 1950s but quickly diminished during the 1970s as class relations in political partnership was dissolving. This is particularly important, as some Marxist social groups state this to be the downfall of the working class and class analysis. Another example of this dissolution of political and class partnership is Britain's politics; in how political party conflicts tended to focus more on issues instead of interest of the class community. This in turn creates family-party separation which fuels different political party interest. Heath and his associates have theorized the dissolution of this partnership to be derivative of absolute and relative rates in class voting and social mobility. These theories develop through the class development of Britain during the latter half of the 20th centuries by implication of \"trends in patterns of class mobility, in levels of class identification, and in class differences in political attitudes and values\". Heath and his colleagues try to argue empirically against theories of Dunleavy and associates who stated that new structural cleavages were becoming the foundations for party support. On top of empirical support against, Goldthorpe explains that fluidity and boundaries are the major point against the theories of Dunleavy and his colleagues.\n\nClass interest is the interest one assumes when in a set location inside of class relations. Erik Wright describes such as examples as \"range of issues, standards of living, working conditions, level of toil, leisure, material security, and other things\". This is imperative information to understand when relating individual actions according to their class location.\n\nClass practices are the derived as the actions taken by the individual or group with the objective of their own class interest.\n\n"}

{"id": "412676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=412676", "title": "Conflict resolution", "text": "Conflict resolution\n\nConflict resolution is conceptualized as the methods and processes involved in facilitating the peaceful ending of conflict and retribution. Committed group members attempt to resolve group conflicts by actively communicating information about their conflicting motives or ideologies to the rest of the group (e.g., intentions; reasons for holding certain beliefs) and by engaging in collective negotiation. Dimensions of resolution typically parallel the dimensions of conflict in the way the conflict is processed. Cognitive resolution is the way disputants understand and view the conflict, with beliefs, perspectives, understandings and attitudes. Emotional resolution is in the way disputants feel about a conflict, the emotional energy. Behavioral resolution is reflective of how the disputants act, their behavior. Ultimately a wide range of methods and procedures for addressing conflict exist, including negotiation, mediation, mediation-arbitration, diplomacy, and creative peacebuilding.\n\nThe term \"conflict resolution\" may also be used interchangeably with \"dispute resolution\", where arbitration and litigation processes are critically involved. The concept of conflict resolution can be thought to encompass the use of nonviolent resistance measures by conflicted parties in an attempt to promote effective resolution.\n\nThe dual concern model of conflict resolution is a conceptual perspective that assumes individuals’ preferred method of dealing with conflict is based on two underlying themes or dimensions: concern for self (assertiveness) and concern for others (empathy).\n\nAccording to the model, group members balance their concern for satisfying personal needs and interests with their concern for satisfying the needs and interests of others in different ways. The intersection of these two dimensions ultimately leads individuals towards exhibiting different styles of conflict resolution. The dual model identifies five conflict resolution styles/strategies that individuals may use depending on their dispositions toward pro-self or pro-social goals.\n\nThere are many examples of conflict resolution in history, and there has been a debate about the ways to conflict resolution: whether it should be forced or peaceful. Conflict resolution by peaceful means is always a better option. The conflict resolution curve derived from an analytical model offers a peaceful solution by motivating conflicting entities. Forced resolution of conflict might invoke another conflict in future.\n\nConflict resolution curve (CRC) separates conflict styles into two separate domains: domain of competing entities and domain of accommodating entities(Image of CRC ). There is a sort of agreement between targets and aggressors on this curve. Their judgements of badness compared to goodness of each other are analogous on CRC. So, arrival of all conflicting entities to some negotiable points on CRC is important before peace building. CRC does not exist (i.e., singular) in reality if the chance of aggression of the aggressor is certain. Under such circumstances it might lead to apocalypse with mutual destruction.\nThe curve explains why nonviolent struggles ultimately toppled repressive regimes from power and sometimes forced leaders to change the nature of governance. Also, this methodology has been applied to capture the conflict styles in Korean Peninsula and dynamics of negotiation process.\n\nWars may occur between parties who contest an incompatibility. The nature of an incompatibility can be territorial or governmental, but a warring party must be a \"government of a state or any opposition organization or alliance of organizations that uses armed force to promote its position in the incompatibility in an intrastate or an interstate armed conflict\". Wars can conclude with a peace agreement, which is a \"formal agreement... which addresses the disputed incompatibility, either by settling all or part of it, or by clearly outlining a process for how... to regulate the incompatibility.\" A ceasefire is another form of agreement made by warring parties; unlike a peace agreement, it only \"regulates the conflict behaviour of warring parties\", and does not resolve the issue that brought the parties to war in the first place.\n\nPeacekeeping measures may be deployed to avoid violence in solving such incompatibilities. Beginning in the last century, political theorists have been developing the theory of a global peace system that relies upon broad social and political measures to avoid war in the interest of achieving world peace. The Blue Peace approach developed by Strategic Foresight Group facilitates cooperation between countries over shared water resources, thus reducing the risk of war and enabling sustainable development.\n\nConflict resolution is an expanding field of professional practice, both in the U.S. and around the world. The escalating costs of conflict have increased use of third parties who may serve as a conflict specialists to resolve conflicts. In fact, relief and development organizations have added peace-building specialists to their teams. Many major international non-governmental organizations have seen a growing need to hire practitioners trained in conflict analysis and resolution. Furthermore, this expansion has resulted in the need for conflict resolution practitioners to work in a variety of settings such as in businesses, court systems, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and educational institutions throughout the world.\n\nConflict resolution as both a professional practice and academic field is highly sensitive to cultural practices. In Western cultural contexts, such as Canada and the United States, successful conflict resolution usually involves fostering communication among disputants, problem solving, and drafting agreements that meet underlying needs. In these situations, conflict resolvers often talk about finding a mutually satisfying (\"win-win\") solution for everyone involved.\n\nIn many non-Western cultural contexts, such as Afghanistan, Vietnam, and China, it is also important to find \"win-win\" solutions; however, the routes taken to find them may be very different. In these contexts, direct communication between disputants that explicitly addresses the issues at stake in the conflict can be perceived as very rude, making the conflict worse and delaying resolution. It can make sense to involve religious, tribal, or community leaders; communicate difficult truths through a third party; or make suggestions through stories. Intercultural conflicts are often the most difficult to resolve because the expectations of the disputants can be very different, and there is much occasion for misunderstanding.\n\nConflict resolution has also been studied in non-humans, including dogs, cats, monkeys, snakes, elephants, and primates. Aggression is more common among relatives and within a group than between groups. Instead of creating distance between the individuals, primates tend to be more intimate in the period after an aggressive incident. These intimacies consist of grooming and various forms of body contact. Stress responses, including increased heart rates, usually decrease after these reconciliatory signals. Different types of primates, as well as many other species who live in groups, display different types of conciliatory behavior. Resolving conflicts that threaten the interaction between individuals in a group is necessary for survival, giving it a strong evolutionary value. These findings contradict previous existing theories about the general function of aggression, i.e. creating space between individuals (first proposed by Konrad Lorenz), which seems to be more the case in conflicts between groups than it is within groups.\n\nIn addition to research in primates, biologists are beginning to explore reconciliation in other animals. Until recently, the literature dealing with reconciliation in non-primates has consisted of anecdotal observations and very little quantitative data. Although peaceful post-conflict behavior had been documented going back to the 1960s, it was not until 1993 that Rowell made the first explicit mention of reconciliation in feral sheep. Reconciliation has since been documented in spotted hyenas, lions, bottlenose dolphins, dwarf mongoose, domestic goats, domestic dogs, and, recently, in red-necked wallabies.\n\nUniversities worldwide offer programs of study pertaining to conflict research, analysis, and practice. Conrad Grebel University College at the University of Waterloo has the oldest-running peace and conflict studies (PACS) program in Canada. PACS can be taken as an Honors, 4-year general, or 3-year general major, joint major, minor, and diploma. Grebel also offers an interdisciplinary Master of Peace and Conflict Studies professional program. The Cornell University ILR School houses the Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution, which offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional training on conflict resolution. It also offers dispute resolution concentrations for its , JD/MILR, MPS, and MS/PhD graduate degree programs. At the graduate level, Eastern Mennonite University's Center for Justice and Peacebuilding offers a Master of Arts in Conflict Transformation, a dual Master of Divinity/MA in Conflict Transformation degree, and several graduate certificates. EMU also offers an accelerated 5-year BA in Peacebuilding and Development/MA in Conflict Transformation. Additional graduate programs are offered at Georgetown University, Johns Hopkins University, Creighton University, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and Trinity College Dublin. George Mason University’s School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution offers BA, BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Conflict Analysis and Resolution, as well as an undergraduate minor, graduate certificates, and joint degree programs. Nova Southeastern University also offers a PhD in Conflict Analysis & Resolution, in both online and on-campus formats.\n\nConflict resolution is a growing area of interest in UK pedagogy, with teachers and students both encouraged to learn about mechanisms that lead to aggressive action and those that lead to peaceful resolution. The University of Law, one of the oldest common law training institutions in the world, offers a legal-focused masters degree in Conflict Resolution as an LL.M. (Conflict resolution).\n\nTel Aviv University offers two graduate degree programs in the field of conflict resolution, including the English-language International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation, allowing students to learn in a geographic region which is the subject of much research on international conflict resolution.\n\nThe Nelson Mandela Center for Peace & Conflict Resolution at Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi, is one of the first centers for peace and conflict resolution to be established at an Indian university. It offers a two-year full-time MA course in Conflict Analysis and Peace-Building, as well as a PhD in Conflict and Peace Studies.\n\nConflict management refers to the long-term management of intractable conflicts. It is the label for the variety of ways by which people handle grievances—standing up for what they consider to be right and against what they consider to be wrong. Those ways include such diverse phenomena as gossip, ridicule, lynching, terrorism, warfare, feuding, genocide, law, mediation, and avoidance. Which forms of conflict management will be used in any given situation can be somewhat predicted and explained by the social structure—or social geometry—of the case.\n\nConflict management is often considered to be distinct from conflict resolution. \nIn order for actual conflict to occur, there should be an expression of exclusive patterns which explain why and how the conflict was expressed the way it was. Conflict is often connected to a previous issue. Resolution refers to resolving a dispute to the approval of one or both parties, whereas management is concerned with an ongoing process that may never have a resolution. Neither is considered the same as conflict transformation, which seeks to reframe the positions of the conflict parties.\n\nThe role of culture is not always fully appreciated and must be taken into account. In a piece on “the ocean model of civilization”, Prof Nayef Al-Rodhan argues that greater transcultural understanding is critical for global security because it diminishes ‘hierarchies’ and alienation, and avoids dehumanization of the ‘other’.\n\nWhen personal conflict leads to frustration and loss of efficiency, counseling may prove helpful. Although few organizations can afford to have professional counselors on staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or \"listening with understanding\", is little more than being a good listener—something every manager should be.\n\nSometimes simply being able to express one's feelings to a concerned and understanding listener is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for an individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind. The nondirective approach is one effective way for managers to deal with frustrated subordinates and coworkers.\n\nThere are other, more direct and more diagnostic, methods that could be used in appropriate circumstances. However, the great strength of the nondirective approach lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor's diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. Listening to staff with sympathy and understanding is unlikely to escalate the problem, and is a widely-used approach for helping people cope with problems that interfere with their effectiveness in the workplace.\n\nStep 1: Clarifying and focusing: problem ownership\n\nNegative feelings such as annoyance, anger and discomfort can interfere with understanding exactly what is wrong in situations of confrontation and how to set things right again. Gaining a bit of distance from negative feelings is exactly what such moments call for, especially on the part of the person with (presumably) the greatest maturity. \"Problem ownership\" is defined as deciding who should take ownership of the behavior or conflict in the issue (Gordon, 2003). The main person who is bothered by the root problem is also the “owner” of the problem, and thus the owner of a problem needs to be the one who takes primary responsibility for solving the issue. Identifying ownership makes a difference in how behavior is dealt with, as well as how the problem is effectively solved. It is important to ask clarifying questions to really understand the root causes of the conflict.\n\nStep 2: Active listening\n\nSeveral strategies help with distinguishing who has a problem with a behavior and who takes ownership. One of those strategies is active listening. Active listening is attending carefully to all aspects of what a student says and attempting to understand or empathize as much as one can (Seifert & Sutton). Active listening consists of continually asking questions in order to test your understanding. It also requires giving encouragement to the student by letting them tell their story, and paraphrasing what the student says so you can form an unbiased conclusion. It is key not to move too quickly at solving the problem by just giving advice, instructions, or scolding. Responding too soon with solutions can shut down the student’s communication and leave you with inaccurate impressions of the source or nature of the problem (Seifert & Sutton).\n\nStep 3: Assertive discipline and I-messages\n\nOnce you, as the teacher, have taken in the student’s point of view, form your comments around how the student’s behavior affects your role. Your comments should be assertive, emphasize I-messages, and encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her behavior. They should not be passive, apologetic, hostile or aggressive, but matter-of-fact, such as, “Charlie, you are talking while I am talking.” The comments should emphasize I-messages that focus on how the behavior is affecting the teacher’s teaching and the other students' learning (Seifert & Sutton). An example of this would be, “You are making it hard for me to focus on teaching this math lesson.” Lastly, you should ask the student more open-ended questions that make him or her think about the consequences of his or her behavior, such as, “How do the other kids feel when you yell in the middle of class?” (Seifert & Sutton). \n\nStep 4: Negotiation\n\nSeifert and Sutton state that the first three steps describe desirable ways of handling situations that are specific and last for only a short time. These steps by themselves could potentially not be enough when conflicts persist over extended periods of time. Often it is better to negotiate a solution in these situations. Negotiating is defined as methodically deliberating various options and deciding on one if possible (Seifert & Sutton). Even though negotiation demands time and energy, it often demands less time or effort ultimately than continuing to cope with the problem. The results of negotiation can be valuable to everyone involved in the situation. Various experts on conflict resolution have suggested different ways to negotiate with students about problems that are continual (Seifert & Sutton). The theories differ in specifics, but typically are generally similar to the steps we previously discussed:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6026", "title": "Countable set", "text": "Countable set\n\nIn mathematics, a countable set is a set with the same cardinality (number of elements) as some subset of the set of natural numbers. A countable set is either a finite set or a countably infinite set. Whether finite or infinite, the elements of a countable set can always be counted one at a time and, although the counting may never finish, every element of the set is associated with a unique natural number.\n\nSome authors use countable set to mean \"countably infinite\" alone. To avoid this ambiguity, the term \"at most countable\" may be used when finite sets are included and \"countably infinite\", \"enumerable\", or \"denumerable\" otherwise.\n\nGeorg Cantor introduced the term \"countable set\", contrasting sets that are countable with those that are \"uncountable\" (i.e., \"nonenumerable\" or \"nondenumerable\"). Today, countable sets form the foundation of a branch of mathematics called \"discrete mathematics\".\n\nA set is \"countable\" if there exists an injective function from to the natural numbers }.\n\nIf such an can be found that is also surjective (and therefore bijective), then is called \"countably infinite.\"\n\nIn other words, a set is \"countably infinite\" if it has one-to-one correspondence with the natural number set, .\n\nAs noted above, this terminology is not universal. Some authors use countable to mean what is here called \"countably infinite,\" and do not include finite sets.\n\nAlternative (equivalent) formulations of the definition in terms of a bijective function or a surjective function can also be given. See below.\n\nIn 1874, in his first set theory article, Cantor proved that the set of real numbers is uncountable, thus showing that not all infinite sets are countable. In 1878, he used one-to-one correspondences to define and compare cardinalities. In 1883, he extended the natural numbers with his infinite ordinals, and used sets of ordinals to produce an infinity of sets having different infinite cardinalities.\n\nA \"set\" is a collection of \"elements\", and may be described in many ways. One way is simply to list all of its elements; for example, the set consisting of the integers 3, 4, and 5 may be denoted {3, 4, 5}. This is only effective for small sets, however; for larger sets, this would be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead of listing every single element, sometimes an ellipsis (\"...\") is used, if the writer believes that the reader can easily guess what is missing; for example, {1, 2, 3, ..., 100} presumably denotes the set of integers from 1 to 100. Even in this case, however, it is still \"possible\" to list all the elements, because the set is \"finite\".\n\nSome sets are \"infinite\"; these sets have more than \"n\" elements for any integer \"n\". For example, the set of natural numbers, denotable by {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}, has infinitely many elements, and we cannot use any normal number to give its size. Nonetheless, it turns out that infinite sets do have a well-defined notion of size (or more properly, of \"cardinality\", which is the technical term for the number of elements in a set), and not all infinite sets have the same cardinality.\nTo understand what this means, we first examine what it \"does not\" mean. For example, there are infinitely many odd integers, infinitely many even integers, and (hence) infinitely many integers overall. However, it turns out that the number of even integers, which is the same as the number of odd integers, is also the same as the number of integers overall. This is because we arrange things such that for every integer, there is a distinct even integer: ... −2→−4, −1→−2, 0→0, 1→2, 2→4, ...; or, more generally, \"n\"→2\"n\", see picture. What we have done here is arranged the integers and the even integers into a \"one-to-one correspondence\" (or \"bijection\"), which is a function that maps between two sets such that each element of each set corresponds to a single element in the other set.\n\nHowever, not all infinite sets have the same cardinality. For example, Georg Cantor (who introduced this concept) demonstrated that the real numbers cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (non-negative integers), and therefore that the set of real numbers has a greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers.\n\nA set is \"countable\" if: (1) it is finite, or (2) it has the same cardinality (size) as the set of natural numbers. Equivalently, a set is \"countable\" if it has the same cardinality as some subset of the set of natural numbers. Otherwise, it is \"uncountable\".\n\nBy definition a set \"S\" is \"countable\" if there exists an injective function \"f\" : \"S\" → N from \"S\" to the natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.\n\nIt might seem natural to divide the sets into different classes: put all the sets containing one element together; all the sets containing two elements together; ...; finally, put together all infinite sets and consider them as having the same size.\nThis view is not tenable, however, under the natural definition of size.\n\nTo elaborate this we need the concept of a bijection. Although a \"bijection\" seems a more advanced concept than a number, the usual development of mathematics in terms of set theory defines functions before numbers, as they are based on much simpler sets. This is where the concept of a bijection comes in: define the correspondence\n\nSince every element of {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"} is paired with \"precisely one\" element of {1, 2, 3}, \"and\" vice versa, this defines a bijection.\n\nWe now generalize this situation and \"define\" two sets as of the same size if (and only if) there is a bijection between them. For all finite sets this gives us the usual definition of \"the same size\". What does it tell us about the size of infinite sets?\n\nConsider the sets \"A\" = {1, 2, 3, ... }, the set of positive integers and \"B\" = {2, 4, 6, ... }, the set of even positive integers. We claim that, under our definition, these sets have the same size, and that therefore \"B\" is countably infinite. Recall that to prove this we need to exhibit a bijection between them. But this is easy, using \"n\" ↔ 2\"n\", so that\n\nAs in the earlier example, every element of A has been paired off with precisely one element of B, and vice versa. Hence they have the same size. This is an example of a set of the same size as one of its proper subsets, which is impossible for finite sets.\n\nLikewise, the set of all ordered pairs of natural numbers is countably infinite, as can be seen by following a path like the one in the picture: The resulting mapping is like this:\nThis mapping covers all such ordered pairs.\n\nIf you treat each pair as being the numerator and denominator of a vulgar fraction, then for every positive fraction, we can come up with a distinct number corresponding to it. This representation includes also the natural numbers, since every natural number is also a fraction \"N\"/1. So we can conclude that there are exactly as many positive rational numbers as there are positive integers. This is true also for all rational numbers, as can be seen below.\n\nTheorem: The Cartesian product of finitely many countable sets is countable.\n\nThis form of triangular mapping recursively generalizes to vectors of finitely many natural numbers by repeatedly mapping the first two elements to a natural number. For example, (0,2,3) maps to (5,3), which maps to 39.\n\nSometimes more than one mapping is useful. This is where you map the set you want to show is countably infinite onto another set—and then map this other set to the natural numbers. For example, the positive rational numbers can easily be mapped to (a subset of) the pairs of natural numbers because \"p\"/\"q \"maps to (\"p\", \"q\").\n\nWhat about infinite subsets of countably infinite sets? Do these have fewer elements than N?\n\nTheorem: Every subset of a countable set is countable. In particular, every infinite subset of a countably infinite set is countably infinite.\n\nFor example, the set of prime numbers is countable, by mapping the \"n\"-th prime number to \"n\":\n\nWhat about sets being naturally \"larger than\" N? For instance, Z the set of all integers or Q, the set of all rational numbers, which intuitively may seem much bigger than N. But looks can be deceiving, for we assert:\n\nTheorem: Z (the set of all integers) and Q (the set of all rational numbers) are countable.\n\nIn a similar manner, the set of algebraic numbers is countable.\n\nThese facts follow easily from a result that many individuals find non-intuitive.\n\nTheorem: Any finite union of countable sets is countable. \nWith the foresight of knowing that there are uncountable sets, we can wonder whether or not this last result can be pushed any further. The answer is \"yes\" and \"no\", we can extend it, but we need to assume a new axiom to do so.\n\nTheorem: (Assuming the axiom of countable choice) The union of countably many countable sets is countable.\n\nFor example, given countable sets a, b, c, ...\nUsing a variant of the triangular enumeration we saw above:\n\n\nNote that this only works if the sets a, b, c, ... are disjoint. If not, then the union is even smaller and is therefore also countable by a previous theorem.\n\nAlso note that we need the axiom of countable choice to index \"all\" the sets a, b, c, ... simultaneously.\n\nTheorem: The set of all finite-length sequences of natural numbers is countable.\n\nThis set is the union of the length-1 sequences, the length-2 sequences, the length-3 sequences, each of which is a countable set (finite Cartesian product). So we are talking about a countable union of countable sets, which is countable by the previous theorem.\n\nTheorem: The set of all finite subsets of the natural numbers is countable.\n\nIf you have a finite subset, you can order the elements into a finite sequence. There are only countably many finite sequences, so also there are only countably many finite subsets.\n\nThe following theorem gives equivalent formulations in terms of a bijective function or a surjective function. A proof of this result can be found in Lang's text.\n\n(Basic) Theorem: Let \"S\" be a set. The following statements are equivalent:\n\nCorollary: Let \"S\" and \"T\" be sets.\n\nCantor's theorem asserts that if \"A\" is a set and \"P\"(\"A\") is its power set, i.e. the set of all subsets of \"A\", then there is no surjective function from \"A\" to \"P\"(\"A\"). A proof is given in the article Cantor's theorem. As an immediate consequence of this and the Basic Theorem above we have:\n\nProposition: The set \"P\"(N) is not countable; i.e. it is uncountable.\n\nFor an elaboration of this result see Cantor's diagonal argument.\n\nThe set of real numbers is uncountable (see Cantor's first uncountability proof), and so is the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers.\nThe proofs of the statements in the above section rely upon the existence of functions with certain properties. This section presents functions commonly used in this role, but not the verifications that these functions have the required properties. The Basic Theorem and its Corollary are often used to simplify proofs. Observe that in that theorem can be replaced with any countably infinite set.\n\nProposition: Any finite set is countable.\n\nProof: Let be such a set. Two cases are to be considered: Either is empty or it isn't. 1.) The empty set is even itself a subset of the natural numbers, so it is countable. 2.) If is nonempty and finite, then by definition of finiteness there is a bijection between and the set {1, 2, ..., } for some positive natural number . This function is an injection from into .\n\nProposition: Any subset of a countable set is countable.\n\nProof: The restriction of an injective function to a subset of its domain is still injective.\n\nProposition: If is a countable set then } is countable.\n\nProof: If there is nothing to be shown. Otherwise let be an injection. Define by and \n\nProposition: If and are countable sets then is countable.\n\nProof: Let and be injections. Define a new injection by if is in and if is in but not in .\n\nProposition: The Cartesian product of two countable sets and is countable.\n\nProof: Observe that is countable as a consequence of the definition because the function given by is injective. It then follows from the Basic Theorem and the Corollary that the Cartesian product of any two countable sets is countable. This follows because if and are countable there are surjections and . So\nis a surjection from the countable set to the set and the Corollary implies is countable. This result generalizes to the Cartesian product of any finite collection of countable sets and the proof follows by induction on the number of sets in the collection.\n\nProposition: The integers are countable and the rational numbers are countable.\n\nProof: The integers are countable because the function given by if is non-negative and if is negative, is an injective function. The rational numbers are countable because the function given by is a surjection from the countable set to the rationals .\n\nProposition: The algebraic numbers are countable.\n\nProof: Per definition, every algebraic number (including complex numbers) is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Given an algebraic number formula_1, let formula_2 be a polynomial with integer coefficients such that formula_1 is the \"k\"th root of the polynomial, where the roots are sorted by absolute value from small to big, then sorted by argument from small to big. We can define an injection (i. e. one-to-one) function given by formula_4, while formula_5 is the \"n\"-th prime.\n\nProposition: If is a countable set for each in then the union of all is also countable.\n\nProof: This is a consequence of the fact that for each there is a surjective function and hence the function\n\ngiven by is a surjection. Since is countable, the Corollary implies that the union is countable. We use the axiom of countable choice in this proof to pick for each in a surjection from the non-empty collection of surjections from to .\n\nA topological proof for the uncountability of the real numbers is described at finite intersection property.\n\nIf there is a set that is a standard model (see inner model) of ZFC set theory, then there is a minimal standard model (\"see\" Constructible universe). The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem can be used to show that this minimal model is countable. The fact that the notion of \"uncountability\" makes sense even in this model, and in particular that this model \"M\" contains elements that are:\nwas seen as paradoxical in the early days of set theory, see Skolem's paradox.\n\nThe minimal standard model includes all the algebraic numbers and all effectively computable transcendental numbers, as well as many other kinds of numbers.\n\nCountable sets can be totally ordered in various ways, e.g.:\n\nNote that in both examples of well orders here, any subset has a \"least element\"; and in both examples of non-well orders, \"some\" subsets do not have a \"least element\".\nThis is the key definition that determines whether a total order is also a well order.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1589192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1589192", "title": "Emotional reasoning", "text": "Emotional reasoning\n\nEmotional reasoning is a cognitive process by which a person concludes that his/her emotional reaction proves something is true, regardless of the observed evidence. For example, even though a spouse has shown only devotion, a person using emotional reasoning might conclude, \"I know my spouse is being unfaithful because I feel jealous.\"\n\nEmotional reasoning amplifies the effects of other cognitive distortions. For example, a test-taker may feel insecure about their understanding of the material even though they are perfectly capable of answering the questions. If he (or she) acts on his insecurity about failing the written test he might assume that he misunderstands the material and therefore might guess answers randomly, causing his own failure in a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nEmotional reasoning, as a concept, was first introduced by psychiatrist Aaron Beck. It was included as a part of Beck's broader research topic: cognitive distortions and depression. To counteract cognitive distortions, Beck developed a type of therapy formally known as cognitive therapy, which became associated with cognitive-behavioral therapy. Originally, emotional reasoning was attributed to automatic thinking. Beck believed that emotional reasoning stemmed from negative thoughts that were uncontrollable and happened without effort. This reasoning has been commonly accepted over the years. Most recently, a new explanation states that an \"activating agent\" or sensory trigger from the environment increases emotional arousal. With this increase in arousal, certain areas of the brain are inhibited. Combining the increase in emotional arousal with the inhibition of parts of the brain leads to emotional reasoning.\n\nBefore seeking professional help, an individual can influence the effect that emotional reasoning has on them based on his or her coping method. Using a proactive problem-focused coping style leads to more effectiveness at reducing stress and stressful events. Additionally, having good social support also leads to lower psychological stress. If one has to seek professional help, the most common therapy method is cognitive-behavioral therapy. In this approach, the automatic thoughts that control emotional reasoning are studied and realistically reasoned by the patient. In doing so, the psychologist hopes to change the automatic thoughts of the patient and reduce his/her stress levels. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been generally regarded as the most effective method of treatment for emotional reasoning. Most recently, a new therapeutic approach uses the RIGAAR method to reduce emotional stress.\n\nRIGAAR stands for: \n\nAdditionally, reducing emotional arousal is also suggested by the human givens approach as a way to stop emotional reasoning. As seen above, high emotional arousal inhibits brain regions necessary for logical complex reasoning. With less emotional arousal, cognitive reasoning is not diminished and the potential to not associate oneself with his or her emotions is stronger.\n\nIf not treated, debilitating effects can occur, the most common being depression. On the other hand, emotional reasoning has the potential to be good when used to appraise the outside world and not ourselves. It is useful when one has to emotionally appraise something. Judging by how one feels when assessing the object, person, or event, it can be an instinctual survival response and a way to adapt to our world. \"The amygdala buried deep in the limbic system serves as an early warning device for novelty, precisely so that attention can be mobilized to alert the mind to a potential danger and to prepare for a potential of flight or fight\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26266653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26266653", "title": "Frustration", "text": "Frustration\n\nIn psychology, frustration is a common emotional response to opposition, related to anger, annoyance and disappointment, frustration arises from the perceived resistance to the fulfillment of an individual's will or goal and is likely to increase when a will or goal is denied or blocked. There are two types of frustration; internal and external. Internal frustration may arise from challenges in fulfilling personal goals, desires, instinctual drives and needs, or dealing with perceived deficiencies, such as a lack of confidence or fear of social situations. Conflict, such as when one has competing goals that interfere with one another, can also be an internal source of frustration and can create cognitive dissonance. External causes of frustration involve conditions outside an individual's control, such as a physical roadblock, a difficult task, or the perception of wasting time. There are multiple ways individuals cope with frustration such as passive–aggressive behavior, anger, or violence, although frustration may also propel positive processes via enhanced effort and strive. This broad range of potential outcomes makes it difficult to identify the original cause(s) of frustration, as the responses may be indirect. However, a more direct and common response is a propensity towards aggression.\n\nFrustration originates from feelings of uncertainty and insecurity which stems from a sense of inability to fulfill needs. If the needs of an individual are blocked, uneasiness and frustration are more likely to occur. When these needs are constantly ignored or unsatisfied, anger, depression, loss of self-confidence, annoyance, aggression, and sometimes violence are likely to follow. Needs can be blocked two different ways; internally and externally. Internal blocking happens within an individual's mind, either through lack of ability, confidence, conflicting goals and desires, and/or fears. External blocking happens to an individual outside their control such as physical roadblocks, difficult tasks, or perceived waste of time.\n\nSome people are predisposed towards feelings of frustration, indexed in terms of temperament (frustration), in adolescence and neuroticism in adulthood. Temperamental frustration is associated with perceptual alterations including changes in perceived relationship affection.\n\nFrustration can be considered a problem–response behavior and can have a number of effects, depending on the mental health of the individual. In positive cases, this frustration will build until a level that is too great for the individual to contain or allow to continue, and thus produce action directed at solving the inherent problem in a disposition that does not cause social or physical harm. In negative cases, however, the individual may perceive the source of frustration to be outside their control, and thus the frustration will continue to build, leading eventually to further problematic behavior (e.g. violent reaction against perceived oppressors or enemies).\n\nStubborn refusal to respond to new conditions affecting the goal, such as removal or modification of the barrier, sometimes occurs. As pointed out by J.A.C. Brown, severe punishment may cause individuals to continue non-adaptive behavior blindly: \"Either it may have an effect opposite to that of reward and as such, discourage the repetition of the act, or, by functioning as a frustrating agent, it may lead to fixation and the other symptoms of frustration as well. It follows that punishment is a dangerous tool, since it often has effects which are entirely the opposite of those desired\".\n\nFrustration tolerance is one's ability to resist becoming frustrated when facing difficult tasks. Having a low frustration tolerance is related to trait anger and a higher level of frustration tolerance is related to lower levels of anger and longer persistence on difficult tasks. For example, a child with a high frustration tolerance may be able to deal with repeated challenges and failures without experiencing significant frustration. The child with a low frustration tolerance can be quick to experience frustration when asked to perform tasks of moderate difficulty.\n\n\nFrustration \n"}
{"id": "1198661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1198661", "title": "Fuzion", "text": "Fuzion\n\nFuzion is a generic role-playing game system created by the collaboration of R. Talsorian Games and Hero Games. The rights to Fuzion are jointly held by Mike Pondsmith of R. Talsorian Games, along with Steve Peterson and Ray Greer of Hero Games. \"Fuzion\" is a combination of the Interlock System, (used in games like \"Mekton\" and \"Cyberpunk 2020\"), and the HERO system (used in \"Champions\", \"Justice, Inc.\", \"Star Hero\", etc.). \"Fuzion\" is an adaptable system which can be played in any genre and setting imaginable.\n\n\"Fuzion\" is noted for its anime-genre support, customizable rules flexibility, and being one of the first generic game systems to be released for free over the internet. It is one of the first games to readily allow licensing, albeit not the \"hands-off\" licensing offered by the Open Gaming License (OGL) that came about some years later. A modified OGL set of rules based on \"Fuzion\" is published by Gold Rush Games as the \"Action! System\".\n\nThere are two versions of \"Fuzion\" that have been published: the simplified Instant Fuzion, and more detailed Total Fuzion (also known as \"Primary Fuzion\"). A third, Maximum Fuzion, was hinted at in \"Fuzion\"-based \"Bubblegum Crisis\" RPG, but has never been published.\n\n\"Fuzion\" uses a point-based creation method for building characters. This system is similar to both of the parent systems as well as other generic games like \"GURPS\".\n\n\"Fuzion\" characters are built with \"Character Points (CPs)\", also known as Stat Points. Depending on the \"power level\" of the game, the Referee (or Game Master), assigns players a number of CPs to buy Attribute Stats. Usually, 40 to 50 points are enough for a heroic \"action-adventure\" setting. Fewer points would be given for low-power games set in a more realistic, \"mundane\" world. A hundred (or more) points are given for high-powered, superheroic adventures. CPs are used to buy levels in \"Primary Stats\" which are the basic attribute abilities of the character.\n\n\"Option Points (OPs)\", or Campaign Points, are given to characters to buy Character Options. OPs are assigned by the Referee and are usually kept separate from the Character Point pool. The Referee usually gives a pool of as many OPs as he gives CPs. At the player's choice, any leftover CPs not used to buy Stats can be traded for OPs at a ratio of 1:5, (1 CP = 5 OP) and vice versa. OPs can also be converted into money to buy Equipment at a ratio of 1:100; (1 OP = 100 units of currency). The actual type of currency is dependent upon the genre being played, (for instance a fantasy medieval-era game may use gold pieces, a modern action game set in the United States would use dollars, a sci-fi future setting may use galactic credits).\n\nCertain campaigns using the \"Fuzion\" system can have \"Power Points (PPs)\", which are assigned to the players by the Referee just like CPs and OPs. PPs are optional and are used with Magic, Psionics, and Super Powers. CPs can be traded for PPs at a ratio of 1:1, (1 CP = 1 PP), and OPs can be traded as well, at a ratio of 5:1, (5 OP = 1 PP). Using PPs helps the Referee keep superpowers under control by restricting how often a character can use them.\n\nIn \"Total Fuzion\", a character usually has ten \"Stats\", (or Characteristics), organized in four groups as follows:\n\nPhysical Group:\nMental Group:\nCombat Group:\nMovement Group:\n\nIn the slimmed down \"Instant Fuzion\" rules, the character has only four main Stats based on each of the four Stat groups: Physical, Mental, Combat, and Movement.\n\nCharacter Points are used to buy levels in a Stat at a ratio of 1:1; 1 CP buys 1 level of a Stat. For the average \"competent\" human, each Stat has a level of 3 or 4, while 1 and 2 represent mundane abilities. Stats of 5 and 6 are considered \"heroic\"; 7 and 8, are \"legendary\"; 9 and above are \"superhuman\".\n\n\"Fuzion\" is a flexible and easily modifiable system, so more Stats can be added to any category by the Referee as they see fit. For instance, in a magical world, the Referee could add a Mana Stat for the casting and control magic spells, or add a Comeliness Stat, which rates the physical attractiveness of a character. Likewise, Stats can be removed without too much difficulty. If the Referee feels there is no real difference between Dexterity and Reflexes, they could remove one or the other, and use a single Stat for both.\n\n\"Fuzion\" characters have numerous \"Derived Stats\", which get their values based on the level of a primary Stat and performing a mathematical formula to calculate a number. For instance, a character gets Hit Points (called \"Hits\"), and Stun Points (called \"Stun\"), by taking their Body Stat and multiplying it by 5. Therefore, a character with a Body Stat of 5 would have 25 Hits and 25 Stun. Derived Stats do not cost points to purchase. Depending on the genre, the Referee can choose what Derived Stats he wants in his campaign. Some are required, like Hits, Stun, and Recovery, but others, like Luck and Humanity, are optional. Characters can also trade up to 1/2 of their Stun points for more Hits if they so desire.\n\nIn \"Instant Fuzion\", a character has two Derived Stats: Hits and Defense.\n\n\"Fuzion\" characters have Skills that represent specific areas of knowledge that are useful in the game. Skills are purchased with Option Points at a ratio of 1:1, (1 OP = 1 level of a Skill). \"Fuzion\" has a large array of Skills to choose from. Referees and players can also make up their own skills as needed. Skills are organized by type:\n\n\nFor free, a starting character gets a set of \"Everyman Skills\" that are picked by the Referee as appropriate to the campaign. Everyman Skills include 2 points each in such Skills as Education (which includes all basic knowledge a character learns through years of schooling like basic mathematics and reading for example), and other skills, like Evasion, Hand-to-Hand, Local Area Knowledge and Perception. For a modern or futuristic campaign, Driving and Computer Use may also be common Everyman skills. At the Referee's discretion, the Education skill can be used as a catch-all for when a character faces a challenge in a skill they do not possess; they can \"wing it\" by adding their Education skill bonus to the die roll.\n\nCharacter options come in the form of Talents, Complications, Perks, Lifepaths, and Templates.\n\n\"Talents\" represent special innate abilities of a character that cannot be taken away from them, or used by another character. They represent certain areas of special training, or inherited abilities that are not covered by Skills. In a way, they are similar to Advantages in \"GURPS\", or Feats in a \"d20 System\" game, and offer benefits to the character. Talents cost 3 Option Points each. Some Talents include: Combat Sense, Lightning Calculator, Photographic Memory, Light Sleeper, Speed Reading, and Ambidexterity.\n\n\"Complications\" represent special hindrances to the character. They are similar to Disadvantages in \"GURPS\". Complications are a way to gain back OPs to spend elsewhere. Each Complication returns a number of points based on the hindrance they give the character, and how often they crop up in the game. A permanent Complication, such as Missing Limb, is always a problem for a character and returns many points. Others, like Enemy or Dependent, may crop up occasionally during a game and offer less points back. Some other Complications include: Bad Tempered, Sense of Duty, Stubbornness, Dependents, Phobias, Bad Reputation, Poverty, and Addiction.\n\n\"Perks\" are similar to Talents, but are not innate to the character. They can be lost or taken away by actions in the game. They usually include Special Equipment, Security Clearances, Licenses, Permits, and Contacts (who a character can use to gain information or call in favors from).\n\n\"Lifepaths\" are an optional way to randomly generate character backgrounds and personalities through a series of tables. A character rolls on a list of options, or they can pick and chose them as they see fit. Some Lifepath choices could give a character a special Talent, Complication, or Perk for free.\n\n\"Templates\" are featured in certain \"Fuzion\" campaigns, which can be chosen by players to help design a well rounded character suited for a specific career, (such as police officer, soldier, doctor, etc.). Templates explain things about the character's job, and give a listing of particular Skills, Talents, Complications, Perks and starting equipment.\n\nIn \"Fuzion\", whenever a character performs some kind of critical action that needs to be resolved, they make a die roll to see if they succeed or fail at the task. There are two kinds of resolution tests in \"Fuzion\"; those rolled against a \"Difficulty Value (DV)\" determined by the Referee, and those rolled against another character. DVs range from \"very easy\", such as hefting a bag of garbage to the street (DV 2), to \"cosmic\", like hefting a mountain and throwing it into an ocean (DV 100+). When resolving a contest between characters, the DV of the check is the result of the opposing force's roll or, to save time, the Referee could add a set number, \"+X\", to an NPC's abilities (typically +10 when using 3d6 or +5 using 1d10).\n\nRegardless of what the character is rolling against, the player has to roll the target number or higher on the dice to succeed. This the opposite of \"Fuzion's\" parent, the HERO System (which is similar to the GURPS mechanic), where the roll must be equal to, or less than the target number to succeed.\n\nUnder standard rules, \"Fuzion\" offers two ways to resolve actions with dice. A Referee can pick either using three six-sided dice (3d6), like the HERO System, or one ten-sided die (d10), like the Interlock System used in \"Cyberpunk\" and \"Mekton\". Using 3d6 for checks subjects it to the more predictable \"bell curve\" and has a higher probability of success. Using a d10 is more unpredictable and adds a level of uncertainty and suspense. When using d10, the DV values are set lower than when using 3d6.\n\nAnother aspect of \"Fuzion\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s flexibility is the easy adaptation to the use of d12 or d20 dice for making checks. Consult the table below for variations of the Difficulty Values by die type:\nThe resolution formula is: \"Stat + Skill + Die Roll vs. Difficulty Value (DV)\". When an action is opposed by another character or two characters are competing to complete the same action, the formula becomes \"Stat + Skill + Die Roll vs. Stat + Skill + (Die Roll or +X)\". Combat resolution is similar to an opposed skill check. If a character's Stat + Skill already meets or exceeds the DV, it is usually considered an automatic success without making a die roll.\n\nThere is also the optional rule of \"Critical Successes\" and \"Critical Failures\". If using a d10, rolling a 10 is a Critical Success, and allows a second roll. The result of the second roll is added to the first to calculate the result. Further 10's may be rerolled. A roll of 1 is an critical failure and you subtract 1d10 from your total. When using 3d6; a roll of all sixes, (an 18), is a Critical Success, and two additional dice can be rolled and added to the result. A roll of three ones, (a 3), is a Critical Failure, (even if all you only needed to roll was a 3 to succeed the check), and subtract 2d6 from the total. A Critical Failure may represent something more disastrous happening to the character as the Referee sees fit. A Critical Failure on a Lockpicking task, for example, could trigger a silent alarm the character wasn't aware of.\n\n\"Fuzion\" uses rounds, (called \"Phases\"), to time actions taken in combat. A typical Phase in \"Fuzion\" represents 3 seconds of real time, and 20 Phases = 1 minute.\n\nDuring a Phase, a character can perform one of several \"Basic Actions\", such as Attack, Block (Parry), or Move.\n\n\"Advanced Actions\" usually take more time and additional phases to perform, like casting a spell, or performing another complex task.\n\n\"Free Actions\" take such little time that can be performed immediately and do not use up time, such as dropping an item, standing up, or calling to an ally. The character in a party with the highest Reflexes stat acts first, or they can hold the action and wait to see what someone else is doing. There are no Initiative checks unless the Referee decides to randomly see who goes first. In such a case, the Reflexes Stat can be added to the 3d6 die roll. Usually a party of several NPC's act on one Initiative. Initiative is rolled again for each combat Phase, or to save time, the GM can opt to use the same initiative for the rest of the combat scene.\n\nWhen making an opposed roll against another character, (or NPC), the resolution is handled differently and attempt to counteract what the opposition does.\n\nThe typical opposed check formula is:\n\"Attack Value (AV) + Die Roll vs. Defense Value (DV) + Die Roll, or Defense Value + Flat X\"\n\nTo make things easier, a player should calculate their character's AVs and DVs ahead of time before beginning play. Another option for the defender to choose \"Flat X\", (or Flat 10), where the Difficulty is always 10 + the defender's DV. The attacker only rolls dice during the combat Phase, which helps speed a combat scene along. The Flat X can be further modified by armor, cover and range penalties.\n\nLiving characters in \"Fuzion\" can take two kinds of damage; \"Lethal Damage\", (that subtracts Hits), or \"Stun Damage\", that subtracts Stun points. When Hits fall to zero, a character is unconscious and may be dying. Losing further Hits can kill a character if it should fall twice below their Body Stat, that is, a character with Body 5, (and 25 Hits), dies when his Hits fall to -10. When Stun falls to zero, a character is out cold. At this point, any further damage becomes \"Stun Rollover\" at 1/5 the Stun damage and begin deducting from their Hits. When a character loses 1/2 of their Hits, all their stats drop by 2. If 3/4 Hits are lost, all stats drop by 4.\n\nInanimate objects, have \"Structural Damage Points\" or SDPs. When an object loses all its SDPs, it is rendered useless; (a vehicle shuts down and grinds to a halt, a weapon will no longer fire, etc.). It is destroyed when it reaches twice its SDPs in damage. To keep things simple, (and avoid rolling lots of dice), large scale weapons inflict points of damage called \"Kills\", which represent destruction on a much larger scale. Kills are used for such things as giant mecha robots and spaceships. Weapons that inflict Kill damage are not usually small enough to be carried around by characters.\n\nCharacter sized weapons in \"Fuzion\" have \"Damage Classes\", or (DCs). Each point of DC represents a six-sided die that is rolled to see how much damage the weapon can cause. Six-sided dice are always used for damage rolls, regardless of using a d10 (or other die types) for checks. For instance, a light weight handgun typically has a DC of 3; meaning 3d6 is rolled to determine the damage it causes when it hits something. Some weapons also have a \"Weapon Accuracy (WA)\" value. This number is further added to the Attack roll and raise the chances of getting a successful hit.\n\nMelee weapon sometimes have a \"Minimum Strength\" value. This is an optional rule to add more realism. A character must possess the listed minimum level of STR to fully inflict the weapon's damage. For every point of STR under the minimum, the weapon does one less die of damage. For example: A Battleaxe has a DC 5 and a Minimum STR of 5. A character with an STR 3, that uses the Battleaxe, suffers a -2 penalty to his Attack roll. It will also only inflict DC 3 of damage because the character's STR is 2 less than the minimum of 5. The character also suffers a -2 penalty to any Reflex checks and Reflex-based Skill checks when wielding the weapon.\n\nFor unarmed physical damage, a character deals 1 DC of punching damage per level of STR Stat, that is, a character with STR 3 does 3 DC of damage. Kicking adds an additional DC, that is, with a STR of 3, a character deals 4 DC of damage with a kick.\n\nSome \"Fuzion\" campaigns offer an optional \"Hit Location Chart\" where 3d6 is rolled to determine what specific part of the body is hit by an attack. Depending on the location, the damage may be modified. For instance, if damage is applied to the head, the damage taken is doubled. If a hand is struck, the damage is halved. Using Hit Locations allows \"Called Shots\" with a -4 penalty to an attack roll to strike a specific area.\n\nAfter a good game of \"Fuzion\", Referees can reward characters with more Option Points, (or Award Points), which they can use to improve skills, and convert to money to buy more equipment. Enough OPs that are saved up can later allow a player to raise a Stat or two, and maybe buy a Talent or Perk, however the price for future ability upgrades becomes costly and keeps characters from becoming too powerful, too quickly. For example, to raise a skill from 4 to 5 costs a number of Option Points per point of the skill's next level. In this case, 5 option points. To raise it again to 6, costs 6 more points. To raise a primary stat costs 5 option points per level starting with the first. For example, to raise a stat from 4 to 5 costs 25 option points (5x5). Again to 6 would cost 30 more points (5x6).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "588255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=588255", "title": "Green gross domestic product", "text": "Green gross domestic product\n\nThe green gross domestic product (green GDP or GGDP) is an index of economic growth with the environmental consequences of that growth factored into a country's conventional GDP. Green GDP monetizes the loss of biodiversity, and accounts for costs caused by climate change. Some environmental experts prefer physical indicators (such as \"waste per capita\" or \"carbon dioxide emissions per year\"), which may be aggregated to indices such as the \"Sustainable Development Index\".\n\nCalculating green GDP requires that net natural capital consumption, including resource depletion, environmental degradation, and protective and restorative environmental initiatives, be subtracted from traditional GDP. Some early calculations of green GDP take into account one or two but not all environmental adjustments. These calculations can also be applied to net domestic product (NDP), which deducts the depreciation of produced capital from GDP. In each case, it is necessary to convert the resource activity into a monetary value, since it is in this manner that indicators are generally expressed in national accounts.\n\nThe motivation for creating a green GDP originates from the inherent limitations of GDP has as an indicator of economic performance and social progress. It only assesses gross output, and does not have a mechanism for identifying the wealth and assets that underlie output. This is problematic because it cannot account for permanent or significant depletion or replenishment of these assets. Ultimately, GDP has no capacity to identify whether the level of income generated in a country is sustainable. Richard Stone, one of the creators the original GDP indicator, suggested that while \"the three pillars on which an analysis of society ought to rest are studies of economic, socio-demographic and environmental phenomenon\", he had done little work in the area of environmental issues.\n\nIn particular, natural capital is poorly represented in GDP; resources are not adequately considered as economic assets. Relative to their costs, companies and policy makers also do not give sufficient weight to the future benefits generated by restorative or protective environmental projects. As well, the important positive externalities that arise from forests, wetlands and agriculture are unaccounted for or otherwise hidden because of practical difficulties around measuring and pricing these assets. Similarly, the impact that the depletion of natural resources or increases in pollution can and do have on the future productive capacity of a nation are unaccounted for in traditional GDP estimates.\n\nThe need for a more comprehensive macroeconomic indicator is consistent with the conception of sustainable development as a desirable phenomenon. GDP is mistakenly appropriated as a primary indicator of well-being, and as a result, it is used heavily in the analysis of political and economic policy. Green GDP would arguably be a more accurate indicator or measure of societal well-being. Therefore, the integration of environmental statistics into national accounts, and by extension, the generation of a green GDP figure, would improve countries' abilities to manage their economies and resources.\n\nMany economists, scientists and other scholars have theorized about adjusting macroeconomic indicators to account for environmental change. The idea was developed early on through the work of Nordhaus and Tobin (1972), Ahmad et al. (1989), Repetto et al. (1989), and Hartwick (1990).\n\nIn 1972, William Nordhaus and James Tobin introduced the first model to measure the annual real consumption of households, called the Measure of Economic Welfare (MEW). MEW adjusts GDP to include the value of leisure time, unpaid work and environmental damages. They also defined a sustainable MEW (MEW-S) value, and their work was the precursor to more sophisticated measures of sustainable development.\n\nRepetto further explored the impact that the failure of resource-based economies to account for the depreciation of their natural capital could have, especially by distorting evaluations of macroeconomic relationships and performance. He and his colleagues developed the concept of depreciation accounting, which factors environmental depreciation into \"aggregate measures of economic performance\".\n\nIn their seminal report, \"Economic Accounting for Sustainable Development\", Yusuf Ahmad, Salah El Serafy and Ernst Lutz compiled papers from several UNEP-World Bank sponsored workshops, convened after 1983, on how to develop environmental accounting as a public policy tool. The central theme of all of the authors' arguments is that the system of national accounts (SNA), as it traditionally calculates income, omits important aspects of economic development that ought to be included. One important disagreement on environmentally adjusted indicators is presented by Anne Harrison and Salah El Serafy in their respective chapters. Harrison argues that appropriate adjustments ought to be made within the existing SNA framework, while El Serafy suggests a redefinition of what constitutes intermediate and final demand. In his view, the SNA should not consider the sale of natural capital as generating value added, while at least part of the income generated from this sale should be excluded from GDP and net product. This would effectively allow GDP to continue to be used extensively.\n\nIn \"Natural Resources, National Accounting and Economic Depreciation\", John Hartwick presents an accounting methodology to find NNP inclusive of the depletion of natural resource stock by representing the use of natural resources as \"economic depreciation magnitudes\".\n\nThis method of accounting, which makes adjustments to the existing national account indicators, found traction in the System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA), published by the United Nations as an appendix to the 1993 SNA. The report offered five approaches, or versions, to developing environmental accounts. Over the years, the SEEA has been expanded and revised in view of the increased sophistication of accounting methodologies and technology. This revision will be explored in greater detail in the \"Global Initiatives\" section. Ultimately, the importance of the SEEA with respect to the green GDP is that it is possible to create full-sequence accounts from which aggregates such as green GDP can be derived and compared internationally, and many countries have begun this process.\n\nSeveral reports and initiatives after the SEEA-1993 have explored the possibility of expanding or changing the scope of environmentally-adjusted macroeconomic indicators. As the popularity of green GDP and other environmentally adjusted macroeconomic indicators grows, their construction will increasingly draw on this continuously developing body of research, especially with respect to the methodology associated with valuing non-market capital (e.g., services from natural capital which exist outside of traditional market settings).\n\nIn 1993, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the official bookkeeper of the U.S. economy, began responding to concerns that the GDP needed retooling. The agency began working on a green accounting system called Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts. These initial results released in 1994 showed that GDP numbers were overstating the impact of mining companies to the nation's economic wealth. Mining companies didn't like those results, and in 1995 Alan B. Mollohan, a Democratic House Representative from West Virginia's coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 Appropriations Bill that stopped the Bureau of Economic Analysis from working on revising the GDP and that's where things stand today.\n\nCostanza et al. (1997) estimated the current economic value of 17 ecosystem services for 16 biomes. The value of the entire biosphere, most of which exists outside of the market, is estimated conservatively to be between $16–54 trillion per year. By comparison, global GNP is approximately $18 trillion per year. The size of this figure demonstrates the significance of ecosystem services on human welfare and income generation, and the importance of identifying and recognizing this value. The valuation techniques used by the authors were often based on estimations of individuals' \"willingness-to-pay\" for ecosystem services.\n\nKunte et al. (1998) use their paper \"Estimating National Wealth: Methodology and Results\" to demonstrate that expanding the national accounts to include natural capital is a \"practical [and necessary] exercise\". They estimate the total wealth of nations by including different components of wealth in their calculations, including natural capital. They place values on natural capital by using the concept of economic rent. \"Economic rent is the return on a commodity in excess of the minimum required to bring forth its services. Rental value is therefore the difference between the market price and cost of production / extraction.\" Following this, and by adjusting calculations for (un)sustainable use patterns, they are able to determine the stock of natural capital in a country that more accurately reflects its wealth.\n\nNature's Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment, written by William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg and published in 1999, examined whether or not to broaden the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) to include natural resources and the environment. The panel, which addressed this question, concluded that extending the NIPA and developing supplemental environmental accounts should be a high priority goals for the U.S., because these would provide useful data on a variety of economic issues and government trends, which entailed both replenishing and extractive activities. One of the major findings of the report is that it is fundamentally necessary for green adjustments to account for instances when natural capital is discovered or replenished, along with general depletive activities.\n\nIn 2004, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, announced that the green GDP index would replace the Chinese GDP index itself as a performance measure for government and party officials at the highest levels. The first green GDP accounting report, for 2004, was published in September 2006. It showed that the financial loss caused by pollution was 511.8 billion yuan ($66.3 billion), or 3.05 percent of the nation's economy.\n\nAs an experiment in national accounting, the Green GDP effort collapsed in failure in 2007, when it became clear that the adjustment for environmental damage had reduced the growth rate to politically unacceptable levels, nearly zero in some provinces. In the face of mounting evidence that environmental damage and resource depletion was far more costly than anticipated, the government withdrew its support for the Green GDP methodology and suppressed the 2005 report, which had been due out in March, 2007.\n\nIndependent estimates of the cost to China of environmental degradation and resource depletion have for the last decade ranged from 8 to 12 percentage points of GDP growth. These estimates support the idea that, by this measure at least, the growth of the Chinese economy is close to zero.\n\nThe most promising national activity on the green GDP has been from India. The country's environmental minister, Jairam Ramesh, stated in 2009 that \"It is possible for scientists to estimate green GDP. An exercise has started under the country's chief statistician Pronab Sen and by 2015, India's GDP numbers will be adjusted with economic costs of environmental degradation.\"\n\nThe Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) core goals include the mainstreaming of disclosure on environmental, social and governance performance. Although the GRI is independent, it remains a collaborating centre of UNEP and works in cooperation with the United Nations Global Compact. It produces one of the world's most prevalent standards for sustainability reporting—also known as ecological footprint reporting, environmental social governance (ESG) reporting, triple bottom line (TBL) reporting, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting. It is working on a green GDP to be implemented worldwide.\n\nSome critics of environmentally adjusted aggregates, including GDP, point out that it may be difficult to assign values to some of the outputs that are quantified. This is a particular difficulty in cases where the environmental asset does not exist in a traditional market and is therefore non-tradable. Ecosystem services are one example of this type of resource. In the case that valuation is undertaken indirectly, there is a possibility that calculations may rely on speculation or hypothetical assumptions.\n\nSupporters of adjusted aggregates may reply to this objection in one of two ways. First, that as our technological capabilities increase, more accurate methods of valuation have been and will continue to develop. Second, that while measurements may not be perfect in the cases of non-market natural assets, the adjustments they entail are still a preferable alternative to traditional GDP.\n\nA second objection may be found in the Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, when Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi remark that:\n\n\"there is a more fundamental problem with green GDP, which also applies to Nordhaus and Tobin's SMEW and to the ISEW/GNI indices. None of these measures characterize sustainability per se. Green GDP just charges GDP for the depletion of or damage to environmental resources. This is only one part of the answer to the question of sustainability.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "612358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=612358", "title": "Homestead principle", "text": "Homestead principle\n\nThe homestead principle is the principle by which one gains ownership of an unowned natural resource by performing an act of original appropriation. Appropriation could be enacted by putting an unowned resource to active use (as with using it to produce a product), joining it with previously acquired property or by marking it as owned (as with livestock branding). Proponents of intellectual property hold that ideas can also be homesteaded by originally creating a virtual or tangible representation of them. Others however argue that since tangible manifestations of a single idea will be present in many places, including within the minds of people, this precludes their being owned in most or all cases. Homesteading is one of the foundations of Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism.\n\nEnlightenment philosopher John Locke in his work \"Second Treatise of Government\", published in 1690 advocated the Lockean proviso, which allows for homesteading. Locke famously sees the \"mixing of labour\" with land as the source of ownership via homesteading. He writes:\nHowever, Locke held that individuals have a right to homestead private property from nature only so long as \"there is enough, and as good, left in common for others\". The Lockean proviso maintains that appropriation of unowned resources is a diminution of the rights of others to it, and would only be acceptable if it does not make anyone else worse off.\n\nLibertarian philosopher and Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard argues that homesteading includes all the rights needed to engage in the homesteading action, including nuisance and pollution rights. He writes:\nRothbard interprets the physical extent to which a homesteading act establishes ownership in terms of the relevant \"technological unit\", which is the minimal amount necessary for the practical use of the resource. He writes:\nHungarian political philosopher Anthony de Jasay argued that a homesteader, having a claim prior to any other, must be prima facie considered the owner of the resource, in accordance with the principle \"let ownership stand\". He writes:\n\nSimilarly to de-Jasay, Hans Hermann Hoppe argues that the denial of the homesteading rule entails a performative contradiction. That is because honest argumentation must presuppose an intersubjectively ascertainable norm (i.e. justifiable), and all norms not relying on the original establishment of a physical (and therefore evident) link to the owner are subjective in nature, and therefore contradict the presuppositions of argumentation. He writes:\nAyn Rand has not elaborated on the characteristics of homesteading, but had expressed support for compatible laws, such as favourably citing the Homestead Act (1862). She writes:\nLinda and Morris Tannehill argue in \"The Market for Liberty\" that physically claiming the land (e.g. by fencing it in or prominently staking it out) should be enough to obtain good title:\n\nCommon law provides the ad coelum doctrine by which landlords own everything below and above the land, up to the sky and below the earth to its core, with the exception of volatile minerals such as natural gas. The rules governing what constitutes homesteading were not specified by common law but by the local statutory law. Common law also recognizes the concept of adverse possession (\"squatters' rights\"). Rothbard criticized this doctrine as incompatible with his own homestead principle, as a literal application prevent aircraft from traveling over someone's land. Further:\n\nIn the 19th century, a number of governments formalized the homestead principle by passing laws that would grant property of land plots of certain standardized size to people who would settle on it and \"improve\" it in certain ways (typically, built their residence and started to farm at least a certain fraction of the land). Typically, such laws would apply to territories recently taken from their indigenous inhabitants, and which the state would want to have populated by farmers. Examples:\n\n"}

In the United States, the President derives these powers from the loosely worded statements in the Constitution that \"the executive Power shall be vested in a President\" and the president should \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\" (defined in practice, rather than by constitutional or statutory law).\n\nIn re Debs, 158 U.S. 564 (1896)[1] was a Supreme Court decision involving Eugene V. Debs and labor unions. Debs (president of the American Railway Union) was involved in the Pullman Strike earlier in 1894, and challenged the federal injunction ordering the strikers back to work. The injunction had been issued because of the hindrance to transportation of U.S. Mail. However, Debs refused to end the strike and was cited for contempt of court; he appealed the decision to the courts. The main question being debated was whether the President had a right to issue the injunction, which dealt with both interstate and intrastate commerce and shipping on rail cars. The legislative branch had never delegated to the President the power to issue an injunction. However, in a unanimous decision written by Justice David Josiah Brewer, the court ruled in favor of the U.S. government. Joined by Chief Justice Melville Fuller and Associate Justices Stephen Johnson Field, John Marshall Harlan, Horace Gray, Henry Billings Brown, George Shiras, Jr., Howell Edmunds Jackson and Edward Douglass White, the court ruled that the government had a right to regulate interstate commerce and ensure the operations of the Postal Service, along with a responsibility to \"ensure the general welfare of the public.\" \n\nThe constitution is interpreted by the government and the people. However, the limits of inherent powers were articulated in \"Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer\", 343 U.S. 579 (1952)[1]. This case was a Supreme Court decision limiting the power of the president to seize private property in the absence of either specifically enumerated authority under Article Two of the United States Constitution or statutory authority conferred on him by Congress. However, Justice Black's majority decision was qualified by separate concurring opinions of five other members of the Court; this made it difficult to determine the details and limits of the president's power to seize private property in emergencies. Justice Jackson's concurring opinion provided three categories to be considered:\n"}

{"id": "2966100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2966100", "title": "Japanese political values", "text": "Japanese political values\n\nTraditional Japanese political values are commonly characterized by a strong community sense and group solidarity and the importance of personal connections and consensus building. \n\nConcerning values, Japanese politics are generally described as pragmatic, limited by particularistic loyalties, and based on human relations rather than on ideology or principles. The quintessential Japanese leader is a network builder rather than the embodiment of charisma or ideals; more like the crafty and resourceful founder of the Tokugawa bakufu, Tokugawa Ieyasu, than the ruthless but heroic Oda Nobunaga. Such political dynamics are evident, for example, in the workings of the LDP, which has remained the strongest party since 1955 despite their 3-year loss of majority control in the early 1990s.\n\nAs clichés go, the success of Junichiro Koizumi showed that Japan may have just been in waiting for a charismatic, media-savvy politician. In the 2005 House of Representatives election, the personal voter relationship concept was challenged for the first time. So called \"assassin candidates\", with a pro-postal privatization agenda, were set against the \"postal rebels\", critics of postal reform, who were cast out of the LDP but still had local ties in their voting districts. Results were mixed, with some districts taken by the \"rebels\" and some by the \"assassins\".\n\nFurthermore, the pragmatic, personalistic view of politics cannot explain Japan's militaristic past, the political crises of the 1960s, the controversies surrounding the emperor, Article 9, or the unwillingness of many in the Social Democratic Party of Japan, despite a huge political cost, to abandon their antiwar and revolutionary commitment in the early 1990s.\n\nIt also fails to account for the apparently sincerely held ideological beliefs of the wartime period. The \"New Order in Greater East Asia\" was legitimized on the basis of universal principles, such as \"Pan-Asianism,\" \"international justice,\" and \"permanent peace,\" even if the results were quite the opposite. The non-ideological nature of mainstream Japanese politics in the postwar period reflects defeat in war, the failure after 1945 to find a national ideological consensus to replace discredited wartime beliefs, and the commitment of both elite and ordinary Japanese to expanding the economy and raising living standards. As these goals were attained, a complacent, largely apolitical \"middle mass society\" (a term coined by economist Murakami Yasusuke) emerged, in which 90 percent of the people in opinion polls consistently classified themselves as \"middle class.\"\n\nCertain distinctive features of Japanese politics can be identified, although this is not to say that they are unique to Japan. Rather, qualities also found in other political systems, such as the importance of personal connections and consensus building, played an extraordinarily important role in Japanese politics. These features have deep historical roots and reflect values that pervade the society as a whole.\n\nIn both the feudal and the modern eras, a major problem for Japanese political leaders has been reconciling the goals of community survival and the welfare and self-respect of individuals in an environment of extreme scarcity. In recent centuries, Japan lacked the natural resources and space to accommodate its population comfortably. With the exception of Hokkaidō and colonial territories in Asia between 1895 and 1945, there was no \"frontier\" to absorb excess people. One solution was to ignore the welfare of large sectors of the population (peasants and workers) and to use force when they expressed their discontent. Such coercive measures, common during both the Tokugawa and the World War II periods, largely, although not entirely, disappeared in the postwar \"welfare state\" (for example, farmers were evicted from their land to construct the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita Sanrizuka in the 1970s after long negotiations had failed). But non-coercive, or mostly non-coercive, methods of securing popular compliance had developed to an extraordinary degree in social and political life.\n\nThe most important such method is the promotion of a strong sense of community consciousness and group solidarity. Japanese individuals are often characterized as having a strong sense of self-sacrifice and community dedication (see Japanese values). Historians and sociologists note that both traditional and modern Japanese communities—the buraku, the feudal domain with its retinue of samurai, the large commercial houses found in Edo (the future Tokyo), Osaka, and Kyoto before 1868, and modern corporations and bureaucracies with their cohorts of lifetime employees—have striven to be all-inclusive. Such groups serve a variety of functions for the individual, providing not only income and sustenance but also emotional support and individual identity. Japanese called such community inclusiveness the \"octopus-pot way of life\" (\"takotsubo seikatsu\"). Large pots with narrow openings at the top are used by fishermen to capture octopuses, and the term is used to refer to people so wrapped up in their particular social group that they cannot see the world outside its confines.\n\nThe \"group consciousness\" model of Japanese social life, however, has been overstressed at times. A person may often go along with group demands because they serve self-interest in the long run (for example, political contributions may help secure future favors from those in office). Historically, democratic concepts of individual rights and limited government have been deeply appealing because they, too, promise protection of individual autonomy. Despite very different ethical and political traditions, the Japanese people were very receptive to imported liberal ideas both before and after 1945. John Stuart Mill's essay On Liberty, for example, was extremely popular during the Meiji era.\n\nBecause individual, usually passive, resistance to group demands occurs, Japanese leaders have found the creation of a strong community sense to be a difficult and time-consuming task. Harmony (wa), that most prized social value, is not easily attained. One mechanism for achieving wa is the use of rituals to develop a psychological sense of group identity. Political parties and factions, the offices of national and local governments, businesses, university departments, research groups, alumni associations, and other groups sponsor frequent ceremonies and more informal parties for this purpose. A group's history and identity are carefully constructed through the use of songs and symbols (often resembling, in miniature, the Meiji government's creation of symbols of kokutai in the late nineteenth century). Often, an organization's founder, especially if deceased, is regarded as something of a Confucian sage or a Shinto kami (deity). Group members, however, may find that pervasive ritualism allows them to \"go through the motions\" (such as the chanting of banzai! (ten thousand years!) at the end of political rallies, without having to make a deeper commitment to the group.\n\nA second mechanism to promote community solidarity is the building of hierarchical relationships. In this practice, the influence of premodern ethics is readily apparent. In what anthropologist Nakane Chie calls Japan's \"vertical society,\" human relationships are defined in terms of inequality, and people relate to each other as superiors and inferiors along a minutely differentiated gradient of social status, not only within bureaucratic organizations, where it might be expected, but also in academic, artistic, and, especially, political worlds.\n\nHierarchy expresses itself along two dimensions: first, an internal community differentiation of rank by seniority, education, and occupational status; and second, the distinction between \"insiders\" and \"outsiders,\" between members and nonmembers of the community, along with the ranking of whole groups or communities along a vertical continuum. Although internal hierarchy can cause alienation as inferiors chafe under the authority of their superiors, the external kind of hierarchy tends to strengthen group cohesion as individual members work to improve their group's relative ranking. The Japanese nation as a whole has been viewed as a single group by its people in relation to other nations. Intense nationalism has frequently been a manifestation of group members' desire to \"catch up and overtake\" the advanced (\"superior\") nations of the West, while the rights of non-Western nations, like China or Korea, often viewed as \"inferior,\" have been ignored.\n\nLike group consciousness, however, the theme of hierarchy has been overstressed. Contemporary Japanese politics show a strong consciousness of equality, and even traditional communities, such as rural villages, were often egalitarian rather than hierarchical. Citizens' movements of the 1960s and 1970s differed from older political organizations in their commitment to promoting intragroup democracy. In addressing the nation, Emperor Akihito used colloquial Japanese terms that stressed equality, rather than the formal, hierarchy-laden language of his predecessors.\n\nTwo mechanisms for lessening the hierarchy-generated tensions are the seniority principle and early retirement. As men or women grow older, gaining seniority within an organization, they acquire authority and higher status. The seniority principle is reinforced by the traditional reluctance to place younger persons in positions of authority over older ones. The institution of early retirement (top-ranked businesspeople and bureaucrats commonly retired at age fifty-five or sixty) helps to the keep the promotion of others smooth and predictable. The system also helps to enable talented individuals to succeed to the most responsible positions and prevents a small group of older persons (what the Japanese call \"one-man leaders\") from monopolizing leadership positions and imposing increasingly outmoded ideas on the organization. Elite retirees, however, often continue to wield influence as advisers and usually pursue second careers in organizations affiliated with the one from which they retired. (see Elderly people in Japan)\n\nThe circulation of elites that results from the seniority and early retirement principles ensures that everyone within the upper ranks of the hierarchy has a turn at occupying a high-status position, such as a cabinet post in the national government. This principle, in turn, enables people to reward their followers. There has been, for example, a regular turnover of LDP leaders. No individual has served as party president (and prime minister) longer than Sato Eisaku, the incumbent between 1964 and 1972. The average tenure of party presidents / prime ministers between 1964 and 1987 was slightly more than three years. Frequent cabinet reshuffling meant that the average tenure of other cabinet ministers in the same period was a little less than a year. Japan has not been beset with leaders in their seventies and eighties unwilling to give up their powerful positions.\n\nAnother mechanism reducing intragroup tensions is the strong personal, rather than legalistic or ideological, ties between superior and subordinate. These ties are typically characterized in terms of fictive familial relationships, analogous to the bonds between parents and children (the \"oyabun-kobun relationship\"). The ideal leader is viewed as a paternalistic one, with a warm and personal concern for the welfare of his followers. For followers, loyalty is both morally prescribed and emotionally sustained by the system. In the political world, oyabun-kobun relationships are pervasive despite the formal commitment to universalistic, democratic values. At the same time, younger people find such relationships less appealing than their elders. The so-called \"shinjinrui\" (new human beings), born in the affluent 1960s and 1970s, were often criticized by older Japanese for being self-absorbed, egoistic, and \"cool.\" The younger generation is inclined to view with disdain the emotional expression of paternalistic ties, such as in the 1989 television broadcasts of former Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei's supporters weeping profusely over his political retirement.\n\nThe community is often demanding, but it is also fragile, because social ties are sustained not only through legal norms and common self-interest but also through the affective patron-client relationship. Open conflict poses a danger to the survival of this sort of community, and thus policy making requires elaborate consultation and consensus building, usually involving all the parties concerned in order to maintain wa (和), the notion of harmony within a group. According to political scientist Lewis Austin, \"everyone must be consulted informally, everyone must be heard, but not in such a way that the hearing of different opinions develops into opposition. The leader and his assistants `harmonize opinion'... in advance, using go-betweens to avert the confrontation of opposing forces.\" After a preliminary agreement among all has been reached, a formal meeting is held in which the agreed-upon policy will be proposed and adopted.\n\nThis process is called nemawashi (root trimming or binding), evoking the image of a gardener preparing a tree or shrub for transplanting, that is, a change in policy. Austin points out that a common Japanese verb meaning \"to decide\" (\"matomeru\") literally means to gather or bring together. Decisions are \"the sum of the contributions of all.\" Although consensus building is, for leaders, a time-consuming and emotionally exhausting process, it is necessary not only to promote group goals but also to respect and protect individual autonomy. In fact, the process represents reconciliation of the two. In the political system as a whole, most groups play some role in the \"nemawashi\" process. Exceptions are those groups or individuals, such as Koreans or other minority groups, who are viewed as outsiders.\n\nPolitical leaders have to maintain solidarity and harmony within a single group and also secure the cooperation of different groups who are often in bitter conflict. \"Takotsubo seikatsu\" can promote destructive sectionalism. During World War II, rivalry between the Imperial Army and the Imperial Navy was so intense that it was nearly impossible to coordinate their strategic operations. In the postwar political system, prime ministers have often been unable to persuade different ministries, all self-sufficient and intensely jealous \"kingdoms,\" to go along with reforms in such areas as trade liberalization. Observers such as journalist Karel van Wolferen, have concluded that Japan's political system is empty at the center, lacking real leadership or a locus of responsibility: \"Statecraft in Japan is quite different from that in the rest of Asia, Europe, and the Americas. For centuries it has entailed the preservation of a careful balance of semiautonomous groups that share power… These semiautonomous components, each endowed with great discretionary powers, are not represented in one central ruling body.\" This view is probably exaggerated. Leadership in other countries, including the United States, has been paralyzed from time to time by powerful interest groups, and some policies in Japan requiring decisive leadership, such as the creation of social welfare and energy conservation policies in the 1970s and the privatization of state enterprises in the 1980s, have been reasonably successful.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "435331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435331", "title": "Lysenkoism", "text": "Lysenkoism\n\nLysenkoism () was a political campaign conducted by Trofim Lysenko, his followers and Soviet authorities against genetics and science-based agriculture. Lysenko served as the director of the Soviet Union's Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Lysenkoism began in the late 1920s and formally ended in 1964.\n\nThe pseudo-scientific ideas of Lysenkoism assumed the heritability of acquired characteristics (Lamarckism). Lysenko's theory rejected Mendelian inheritance and the concept of the \"gene\"; it departed from Darwinian evolutionary theory by rejecting natural selection. Proponents falsely claimed to have discovered, among many other things, that rye could transform into wheat and wheat into barley, that weeds could spontaneously transmute into food grains, and that \"natural cooperation\" was observed in nature as opposed to \"natural selection\". Lysenkoism promised extraordinary advances in breeding and in agriculture that never came about.\n\nJoseph Stalin supported the campaign. More than 3,000 mainstream biologists were fired or even sent to prison, and numerous scientists were executed as part of a campaign instigated by Lysenko to suppress his scientific opponents. The president of the Agriculture Academy, Nikolai Vavilov, was sent to prison and died there, while scientific research in the field of genetics was effectively destroyed until the death of Stalin in 1953. Research and teaching in the fields of neurophysiology, cell biology, and many other biological disciplines was also negatively affected or banned.\n\nIn modern usage, the term lysenkoism has become distinct from normal pseudoscience. Where pseudoscience pretends to be science, lysenkoism aims at attacking the legitimacy of science itself, usually for political reasons. It is the rejection of the universality of scientific truth, and the purposeful defamation of the scientific method to the level of politics. \n\nIn 1928, Trofim Lysenko, a previously unknown agronomist, claimed to have developed an agricultural technique, termed vernalization, which tripled or quadrupled crop yield by exposing wheat seed to high humidity and low temperature. While cold and moisture exposure are a normal part of the life cycle of autumn-seeded winter cereals, the vernalization technique claimed to increase yields by increasing the intensity of exposure, in some cases planting soaked seeds directly into the snow cover of frozen fields. In reality, the technique was neither new (it had been known since 1854, and was extensively studied during the previous twenty years), nor did it produce the yields he promised, although some increase in production did occur.\n\nWhen Lysenko began his fieldwork in the Soviet Union of the 1930s, the agriculture of the Soviet Union was in a massive crisis due to the forced collectivisation of farms, and the extermination of the kulaks. The resulting famine provoked the people and the government alike to search for any possible solution to the critical lack of food. Lysenko's vernalization practices yielded marginally greater food production on the farms, and he was quickly accepted as the hero of Soviet agriculture.\n\nMany agronomists were educated before the revolution, and even many of those educated afterwards did not agree with the forced collectivization policies. Furthermore, among biologists of the day, the most popular topic was not agriculture at all, but the new genetics that was emerging out of studies of \"Drosophila melanogaster\", commonly known as fruit flies. Drosophilid flies made experimental verification of genetics theories, such as Mendelian ratios and heritability, much easier.\n\nIsaak Izrailevich Prezent, a main Lysenko theorist, presented Lysenko in Soviet mass-media as a genius who had developed a new, revolutionary agricultural technique. In this period, Soviet propaganda often focused on inspirational stories of peasants who, through their own canny ability and intelligence, came up with solutions to practical problems. Lysenko's widespread popularity provided him a platform to denounce theoretical genetics and to promote his own agricultural practices. He was, in turn, supported by the Soviet propaganda machine, which overstated his successes and omitted mention of his failures. This was accompanied by fake experimental data supporting Lysenkoism from scientists seeking favor and the destruction of counter-evidence to Lysenko's theories. Instead of performing controlled experiments, Lysenko claimed that vernalization increased wheat yields by 15%, solely based upon questionnaires taken of farmers.\n\nLysenko's political success was mostly due to his appeal to the Communist Party and Soviet ideology. Following the disastrous collectivization efforts of the late 1920s, Lysenko's \"new\" methods were seen by Soviet officials as paving the way to an \"agricultural revolution.\" Lysenko himself was from a peasant family, and was an enthusiastic advocate of Leninism. During a period which saw a series of man-made agricultural disasters, he was also extremely fast in responding to problems, although not with real solutions. Whenever the Party announced plans to plant a new crop or cultivate a new area, Lysenko had immediate practical suggestions on how to proceed.\n\nSo quickly did he develop his prescriptions—from the cold treatment of grain, to the plucking of leaves from cotton plants, to the cluster planting of trees, to unusual fertilizer mixes—that academic biologists did not have time to demonstrate that one technique was valueless or harmful before a new one was adopted. The Party-controlled newspapers applauded Lysenko's \"practical\" efforts and questioned the motives of his critics. Lysenko's \"revolution in agriculture\" had a powerful propaganda advantage over the academics, who urged the patience and observation required for science.\n\nLysenko was admitted into the hierarchy of the Communist Party, and was put in charge of agricultural affairs. He used his position to denounce biologists as \"fly-lovers and people haters\", and to decry the \"wreckers\" in biology, who he claimed were trying to purposely disable the Soviet economy and cause it to fail. Furthermore, he denied the distinction between theoretical and applied biology.\n\nLysenko presented himself as a follower of Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin, a well-known and well-liked Soviet horticulturist. However, unlike Michurin, he advocated a form of Lamarckism, insisting on using only hybridization and grafting, as non-genetic techniques. With this came, most importantly, the implication that \"acquired\" characteristics of an organism—for example, the state of being leafless as a result of having been plucked—could be inherited by that organism's descendants. This is why Lysenko claimed vernalization would give greater productivity than it did; he believed the ability of his vernalized seeds to flower faster and produce more wheat would be passed on to the next generation of wheat seeds, thus causing vernalization to further amplify the process.\n\nSupport from Joseph Stalin gave Lysenko even more momentum and popularity. In 1935, Lysenko compared his opponents in biology to the peasants who still resisted the Soviet government's collectivization strategy, saying that by opposing his theories the traditional geneticists were setting themselves against Marxism. Stalin was in the audience when this speech was made, and he was the first one to stand and applaud, calling out \"Bravo, Comrade Lysenko. Bravo.\" This event emboldened Lysenko and gave him and his ally Prezent free rein to slander the geneticists who still spoke out against him. Many of Lysenkoism's opponents, such as his former mentor Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov, were imprisoned or even executed because of Lysenko's and Prezent's denunciations.\n\nOn August 7, 1948, the V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences announced that from that point on Lysenkoism would be taught as \"the only correct theory\". Soviet scientists were forced to denounce any work that contradicted Lysenko. Criticism of Lysenko was denounced as \"bourgeois\" or \"fascist\", and analogous \"non-bourgeois\" theories also flourished in other fields in the Soviet academy at this time (see Japhetic theory; socialist realism). Perhaps the only opponents of Lysenkoism during Stalin's lifetime to escape liquidation were from the small community of Soviet nuclear physicists: as Tony Judt has observed, \"It is significant that Stalin left his nuclear physicists alone and never presumed to second guess \"their\" calculations. Stalin may well have been mad but he was not stupid.\"\n\nMany other countries of the Eastern Bloc accepted Lysenkoism as the official \"new biology\" as well; however the acceptance of Lysenkoism was not uniform in communist countries. In Poland, all geneticists except for Wacław Gajewski followed Lysenkoism. Even though Gajewski was not allowed contact with students, he was allowed to continue his scientific work at the Warsaw botanical garden. Lysenkoism was then rapidly rejected starting from 1956 and modern genetics research departments were formed, including the first department of genetics headed by Wacław Gajewski, which was started at the Warsaw University in 1958.\n\nCzechoslovakia adopted Lysenkoism in 1949. Jaroslav Kříženecký (1896–1964) was one of the prominent Czechoslovak geneticists opposing Lysenkoism, and when he criticized Lysenkoism in his lectures, he was dismissed from the Agricultural University in 1949 for \"serving the established capitalistic system, considering himself superior to the working class, and being hostile to the democratic order of the people\", and imprisoned in 1958. In 1963, he was appointed head of the newly established Gregor Mendel department in the Moravian Museum in Brno, the city in which Gregor Mendel pursued his early experiments on inheritance and formulated the laws of Mendelian inheritance.\n\nIn the German Democratic Republic, although Lysenkoism was taught at some of the universities, it had very little impact on science due to the actions of a few scientists (for example, the geneticist and fierce critic of Lysenkoism, Hans Stubbe) and an open border to West Berlin research institutions. Nonetheless, Lysenkoist theories were found in schoolbooks until the dismissal of Nikita Khrushchev in 1964.\n\nLysenkoism dominated Chinese science from 1949 until 1956, particularly during the Great Leap Forward, when, during a genetics symposium opponents of Lysenkoism were permitted to freely criticize it and argue for Mendelian genetics. In the proceedings from the symposium, Tan Jiazhen is quoted as saying \"Since [the] USSR started to criticize Lysenko, we have dared to criticize him too\". For a while, both schools were permitted to coexist, although the influence of the Lysenkoists remained large for several years.\n\nFrom 1934 to 1940, under Lysenko's admonitions and with Stalin's approval, many geneticists were executed (including Isaak Agol, Solomon Levit, Grigorii Levitskii, Georgii Karpechenko and Georgii Nadson) or sent to labor camps. The famous Soviet geneticist and president of the Agriculture Academy, Nikolai Vavilov, was arrested in 1940 and died in prison in 1943. Hermann Joseph Muller (and his teachings about genetics) was criticized as a bourgeois, capitalist, imperialist, and promoting fascism so he left the USSR, to return to the US via Republican Spain. In 1948, genetics was officially declared \"a bourgeois pseudoscience\"; all geneticists were fired from their jobs (some were also arrested), and all genetic research was discontinued.\n\nOver 3,000 biologists were imprisoned, fired, or executed for attempting to oppose Lysenkoism at one time and overall, scientific research in genetics was effectively destroyed until the death of Stalin in 1953. Due to Lysenkoism, crop yields in the USSR actually declined as well.\n\nAt the end of 1952, the situation started changing, possibly due to Stalin taking offense to Lysenko's growing influence. Articles criticizing Lysenkoism were published in newspapers. However, the process of return to regular genetics slowed down in Nikita Khrushchev's times, due to Lysenko showing him the supposed successes of an experimental agricultural complex. It once again became forbidden to criticize Lysenkoism, though it was now possible to express different views, and all geneticists were released or rehabilitated posthumously. The ban was only waived in the mid-1960s.\n\nAlmost alone among Western scientists, John Desmond Bernal, Professor of Physics at Birkbeck College, University of London, and a Fellow of the Royal Society, made an aggressive public defense of Lysenko and some years later gave an obituary of \"Stalin as a Scientist\". However, despite Bernal's endorsement, other members of Britain's scientific community retreated from open support of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe word \"Neo-Lysenkoism\" has occasionally been used by hereditarian researchers, such as Roger Pearson and Bernard Davis, as a pejorative term in the debates over race and intelligence and sociobiology to describe scientists supposedly minimizing the role of genes in shaping human behavior, such as Leon Kamin, Richard Lewontin, Stephen Jay Gould and Barry Mehler.\n\nThe use of the term \"neo-Lysenkoism\" to describe criticism of evolutionary psychology have drawn criticism for misapplying the term \"Lysenkoism\" to things unrelated to actual Lysenkoism. For instance, Lysenko's views on inheritance of acquired characteristics presumed that individuals were born with characteristics acquired by their parents, not tabula rasa. This was integrated into Stalin's purges by presuming that simply having biological parents who were capitalists constituted a risk factor for becoming a dissident due to inheritance of acquired capitalist interest even if the children had not been postnatally raised capitalist. This is argued to show that the definition of \"nature\" as \"anything before birth\" that is used by evolutionary psychologists when they classify ideas of hormones before birth on sexuality and empathy as \"biological\" would also classify Lysenkoism as \"biological\" due to all three being prenatalist but not Mendelian genetic, remarking that accusations of social engineering in \"nurture\" models can simply transform into accusations of prenatal environment engineering in \"womb environment\" models. The usage of the term \"neo-Lysenkoism\" for models of evolution that contradict the Darwinian model of gradual and maximized reproductive success is criticized for missing the point that while it is uncertain whether or not Darwin read about Mendel's genetic discoveries, it is clear that Darwin did not integrate Mendelian genetics into his model of evolution and that Mendel read The Origin of Species and accepted evolution but did not consider his discoveries a solution to any problems with Darwinian evolution, that Mendelian genetics was the primary subject of suppression of modern biology under Lysenkoism, and that Mendelian genetics is actually a source of modern criticism of the maximization of reproductive success model of evolution as Mendelian models show that short term maximized reproductive success of specific genes deplete genetic variation and increase the long term risk of extinction (explaining higher extinction risks in more sexually dimorphic species as a functional similarity between Bateman's principle and asexual reproduction) during environmental change which could not be predicted by premodern models of genetics such as those of Darwin and Lysenko alike. Contrary to the allegation of anti-psychiatry being neo-Lysenkoist, it is remarked that psychiatric medication was not suppressed in the Soviet Union under Lysenkoism, but the use of psychiatric drugs in the Soviet Union actually increased and was approved by the regime during the Lysenko era. It is cited that Communists considered chemical imbalance models of \"mental illnesses\" including but not limited to anti-communism in \"working class\" people in Communist countries more materialistic and in accordance with Marxist dialectical materialism than the idea of other cultural factors than class interest influencíng behavior that was considered idealist, and that this was used as an argument by officials in the Soviet Union for approving increased psychiatric medication.\n\n\n\n"}

MFA is an important tool to study the bio-physical aspects of human activity on different spatial and temporal scales. It is considered a core method of industrial ecology or anthropogenic, urban, social and industrial metabolism. MFA is used to study material, substance, or product flows across different industrial sectors or within ecosystems. MFA can also be applied to a single industrial installation, for example, for tracking nutrient flows through a waste water treatment plant. When combined with an assessment of the costs associated with material flows this business-oriented application of MFA is called material flow cost accounting. MFA is an important tool to study the circular economy and to devise material flow management. Since the 1990s, the number of publications related to material flow analysis has grown steadily. Peer-reviewed journals that publish MFA-related work include the \"Journal of Industrial Ecology\", \"Ecological Economics\", \"Environmental Science and Technology\", and \"Resources, Conservation, and Recycling\".\n\nHuman needs such as shelter, food, transport, or communication require materials like wood, starch, sugar, iron and steel, copper, or semiconductors. As society develops and economic activity expands, material production, use, and disposal increase to a level where unwanted impacts on environment and society cannot be neglected anymore, neither locally nor globally. Material flows are at the core of local environmental problems such as leaching from landfills or oil spills. Rising concern about global warming puts a previously unimportant waste flow, carbon dioxide, on top of the political and scientific agenda. \nThe gradual shift from primary material production to urban mining in developed countries requires a detailed assessment of in-use and obsolete stocks of materials within human society.\nScientists, industries, government bodies, and NGOs therefore need a tool that complements economic accounting and modelling. They need a systematic method to keep track of and display stocks and flows of the materials entering, staying within, and leaving the different processes in the anthroposphere. Material flow analysis is such a method.\n\nMFA is based on two fundamental and well-established scientific principles, the systems approach and mass balance.\nThe system definition is the starting point of every MFA study.\n\nAn MFA system is a model of an industrial plant, an industrial sector or a region of concern. The level of detail of the system model is chosen to fit the purpose of the study. An MFA system always consists of the system boundary, one or more processes, material flows between processes, and stocks of materials within processes. Physical exchange between the system and its environment happens via flows that cross the system boundary. Contrary to the preconceived notion that a system represents a specific industrial installation, systems and processes in MFA can represent much larger and more abstract entities as long as they are well-defined. The explicit system definition helps the practitioner to locate the available quantitative information in the system, either as stocks within certain processes or as flows between processes. An MFA system description can be refined by disaggregating processes or simplified by aggregating processes.\n\nNext to specifying the arrangement of processes, stocks, and flows in the system definition, the practitioner also needs to indicate the scale and the indicator element or material of the system studied.\nThe spatial scale describes the geographic entity that is covered by the system. A system representing a certain industrial sector can be applied to the USA, China, certain world regions, or the world as a whole. \nThe temporal scale describes the point in time or the time span for which the system is quantified. \nThe indicator element or material of the system is the physical entity that is measured and for which the mass balance holds. As the name says, an indicator element is a certain chemical element such as cadmium or a substance such as CO. In general, a material or a product can also be used as indicator as long as a process balance can be established for it. Examples of more general indicators are goods such as passenger cars, materials like steel, or other physical quantities such as energy.\n\nMFA requires practitioners to make precise use of the terms 'material', 'substance', or 'good', as laid out, for example, in chapter 2.1 of Brunner and Rechberger, one of the main references for the MFA method.\n\nOne of the main purposes of MFA is to quantify the metabolism of the elements of the system. Unlike economic accounting, MFA also covers non-economic waste flows, emissions to the environment, and non-market natural resources. \n\nThe process balance is a first order physical principle that turns MFA into a powerful accounting and analysis tool. The nature of the processes in the system determine which balances apply. For a process 'oil refinery', for example, one can establish a mass balance for each chemical element, while this is not possible for a nuclear power station. A car manufacturing plant respects the balance for steel, but a steel mill does not.\n\nWhen quantifying MFA systems either by measurements or from statistical data, mass and other process balances have to be checked to ensure the correctness of the quantification and to reveal possible data inconsistencies or even misconceptions in the system such as the omission of a flow or a process. Conflicting information can be reconciled using data validation and reconciliation, and the STAN-software offers basic reconciliation functionality that is suitable for many MFA application.\n\nMFA studies are conducted on various spatial and temporal scales and for a variety of elements, substances, and goods. They cover a wide range of process chains and material cycles. Several examples:\n\n\n\n\nA state-of-the-art MFA consists of the following steps:\n\nWhile the term 'substance' in 'substance flow analysis (SFA) always refers to chemical substances, the term 'material' in 'material flow analysis (MFA)' has a much wider scope. According to Brunner and Rechberger the term 'material' comprises substances AND goods, and the reason for this wide scope is the wish to apply MFA not only to chemical elements or substances but also to materials like steel, timber, or products like cars or buildings. It is thus possible to conduct an MFA for the passenger vehicle fleet by recording the vehicles entering and leaving the use phase.\n\nMFA is complementary to the other core industrial ecology methods life cycle assessment (LCA) and input-output (I/O) models. Some overlaps between the different methods exist as they all share the system approach and to some extent the mass balance principle. The methods mainly differ in purpose, scope, and data requirements.\n\nMFA studies often cover the entire cycle (mining, production, manufacturing, use, waste handling) of a certain substance within a given geographical boundary and time frame. Material stocks are explicit in MFA, which makes this method suitable for studies involving resource scarcity and recycling from old scrap. The common use of time series (dynamic modelling) and lifetime models makes MFA a suitable tool for assessing long-term trends in material use.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19009", "title": "Milgram experiment", "text": "Milgram experiment\n\nThe Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures was a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram. They measured the willingness of study participants, men from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience. Participants were led to believe that they were assisting an unrelated experiment, in which they had to administer electric shocks to a \"learner.\" These fake electric shocks gradually increased to levels that would have been fatal had they been real.\n\nThe experiment found, unexpectedly, that a very high proportion of men would fully obey the instructions, albeit reluctantly. Milgram first described his research in a 1963 article in the \"Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology\" and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book, \".\"\n\nThe experiments began in July 1961, in the basement of Linsly-Chittenden Hall at Yale University, three months after the start of the trial of German Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. Milgram devised his psychological study to answer the popular contemporary question: \"Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders? Could we call them all accomplices?\" The experiment was repeated many times around the globe, with fairly consistent results.\n\nThree individuals took part in each session of the experiment:\nThe subject and the actor arrived at the session together. The experimenter told them that they were taking part in \"a scientific study of memory and learning\", to see what the effect of punishment is on a subject's ability to memorize content. Also, he always clarified that the payment for their participation in the experiment was secured regardless of its development. The subject and actor drew slips of paper to determine their roles. Unknown to the subject, both slips said \"teacher\". The actor would always claim to have drawn the slip that read \"learner\", thus guaranteeing that the subject would always be the \"teacher\".\n\nNext, the teacher and learner were taken into an adjacent room where the learner was strapped into what appeared to be an electric chair. The experimenter told the participants this was to ensure that the learner would not escape. In a later variation of the experiment, the confederate was sure to mention to the participant that he had a heart condition. At some point prior to the actual test, the teacher was given a sample electric shock from the electroshock generator in order to experience firsthand what the shock that the learner would supposedly receive during the experiment would feel like.\n\nThe teacher and learner were then separated such that they could communicate, but not see each other. The teacher was then given a list of word pairs that he was to teach the learner. The teacher began by reading the list of word pairs to the learner. The teacher would then read the first word of each pair and read four possible answers. The learner would press a button to indicate his response. If the answer was incorrect, the teacher would administer a shock to the learner, with the voltage increasing in 15-volt increments for each wrong answer. If correct, the teacher would read the next word pair.\n\nThe subjects believed that for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual shocks. In reality, there were no shocks. After the learner was separated from the teacher, the learner set up a tape recorder integrated with the electroshock generator, which played prerecorded sounds for each shock level. As the voltage of the fake shocks increased, the learner began making audible protests, such as banging repeatedly on the wall that separated him from the teacher. When the highest voltages were reached, the learner fell silent.\n\nIf at any time the teacher indicated a desire to halt the experiment, the experimenter was instructed to give specific verbal prods. The prods were, in this order:\n\nIf the subject still wished to stop after all four successive verbal prods, the experiment was halted. Otherwise, it was halted after the subject had given the maximum 450-volt shock three times in succession.\n\nThe experimenter also had prods to use if the teacher made specific comments. If the teacher asked whether the learner might suffer permanent physical harm, the experimenter replied, \"Although the shocks may be painful, there is no permanent tissue damage, so please go on.\" If the teacher said that the learner clearly wants to stop, the experimenter replied, \"Whether the learner likes it or not, you must go on until he has learned all the word pairs correctly, so please go on.\"\n\nBefore conducting the experiment, Milgram polled fourteen Yale University senior-year psychology majors to predict the behavior of 100 hypothetical teachers. All of the poll respondents believed that only a very small fraction of teachers (the range was from zero to 3 out of 100, with an average of 1.2) would be prepared to inflict the maximum voltage. Milgram also informally polled his colleagues and found that they, too, believed very few subjects would progress beyond a very strong shock. He also reached out to honorary Harvard University graduate Chaim Homnick, who noted that this experiment would not be concrete evidence of the Nazis' innocence, due to fact that \"poor people are more likely to cooperate.\" Milgram also polled forty psychiatrists from a medical school, and they believed that by the tenth shock, when the victim demands to be free, most subjects would stop the experiment. They predicted that by the 300-volt shock, when the victim refuses to answer, only 3.73 percent of the subjects would still continue and, they believed that \"only a little over one-tenth of one percent of the subjects would administer the highest shock on the board.\"\n\nIn Milgram's first set of experiments, 65 percent (26 of 40) of experiment participants administered the experiment's final massive 450-volt shock, and all administered shocks of at least 300 volts. Subjects were uncomfortable doing so, and displayed varying degrees of tension and stress. These signs included sweating, trembling, stuttering, biting their lips, groaning, digging their fingernails into their skin, and some were even having nervous laughing fits or seizures. Every participant paused the experiment at least once to question it. Most continued after being assured by the experimenter. Some said they would refund the money they were paid for participating.\n\nMilgram summarized the experiment in his 1974 article, \"The Perils of Obedience\", writing:\n\nThe original Simulated Shock Generator and Event Recorder, or \"shock box\", is located in the Archives of the History of American Psychology.\n\nLater, Milgram and other psychologists performed variations of the experiment throughout the world, with similar results. Milgram later investigated the effect of the experiment's locale on obedience levels by holding an experiment in an unregistered, backstreet office in a bustling city, as opposed to at Yale, a respectable university. The level of obedience, \"although somewhat reduced, was not significantly lower.\" What made more of a difference was the proximity of the \"learner\" and the experimenter. There were also variations tested involving groups.\n\nThomas Blass of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County performed a meta-analysis on the results of repeated performances of the experiment. He found that while the percentage of participants who are prepared to inflict fatal voltages ranged from 28% to 91%, there was no significant trend over time and the average percentage for US studies (61%) was close to the one for non-US studies (66%).\n\nThe participants who refused to administer the final shocks neither insisted that the experiment be terminated, nor left the room to check the health of the victim without requesting permission to leave, as per Milgram's notes and recollections, when fellow psychologist Philip Zimbardo asked him about that point.\n\nMilgram created a documentary film titled \"Obedience\" showing the experiment and its results. He also produced a series of five social psychology films, some of which dealt with his experiments.\n\nThe Milgram Shock Experiment raised questions about the research ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress and inflicted insight suffered by the participants. Some critics such as Gina Perry argued that participants were not properly debriefed. In Milgram's defense, 84 percent of former participants surveyed later said they were \"glad\" or \"very glad\" to have participated; 15 percent chose neutral responses (92% of all former participants responding). Many later wrote expressing thanks. Milgram repeatedly received offers of assistance and requests to join his staff from former participants. Six years later (at the height of the Vietnam War), one of the participants in the experiment sent correspondence to Milgram, explaining why he was glad to have participated despite the stress:\n\nIn his book \"\", Milgram argued that the ethical criticism provoked by his experiments was because his findings were disturbing and revealed unwelcome truths about human nature. Others have argued that the ethical debate has diverted attention from more serious problems with the experiment's methodology.\n\nMilgram sparked direct critical response in the scientific community by claiming that \"a common psychological process is centrally involved in both [his laboratory experiments and Nazi Germany] events.\" James Waller, Chair of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Keene State College, formerly Chair of Whitworth College Psychology Department, expressed the opinion that Milgram experiments \"do not correspond well\" to the Holocaust events:\n\nIn the opinion of Thomas Blass—who is the author of a scholarly monograph on the experiment (\"The Man Who Shocked The World\") published in 2004—the historical evidence pertaining to actions of the Holocaust perpetrators speaks louder than words:\n\nIn a 2004 issue of the journal \"Jewish Currents\", Joseph Dimow, a participant in the 1961 experiment at Yale University, wrote about his early withdrawal as a \"teacher\", suspicious \"that the whole experiment was designed to see if ordinary Americans would obey immoral orders, as many Germans had done during the Nazi period.\"\n\nIn 2012 Australian psychologist Gina Perry investigated Milgram's data and writings and concluded that Milgram had manipulated the results, and that there was \"troubling mismatch between (published) descriptions of the experiment and evidence of what actually transpired.\" She wrote that \"only half of the people who undertook the experiment fully believed it was real and of those, 66% disobeyed the experimenter\". She described her findings as \"an unexpected outcome\" that \"leaves social psychology in a difficult situation.\"\n\nMilgram elaborated two theories:\n\nIn his book \"Irrational Exuberance\", Yale finance professor Robert J. Shiller argues that other factors might be partially able to explain the Milgram Experiments:\n\nIn a 2006 experiment, a computerized avatar was used in place of the learner receiving electrical shocks. Although the participants administering the shocks were aware that the learner was unreal, the experimenters reported that participants responded to the situation physiologically \"as if it were real\".\n\nAnother explanation of Milgram's results invokes belief perseverance as the underlying cause. What \"people cannot be counted on is to realize that a seemingly benevolent authority is in fact malevolent, even when they are faced with overwhelming evidence which suggests that this authority is indeed malevolent. Hence, the underlying cause for the subjects' striking conduct could well be conceptual, and not the alleged 'capacity of man to abandon his humanity ... as he merges his unique personality into larger institutional structures.\"'\n\nThis last explanation receives some support from a 2009 episode of the BBC science documentary series \"Horizon\", which involved replication of the Milgram experiment. Of the twelve participants, only three refused to continue to the end of the experiment. Speaking during the episode, social psychologist Clifford Stott discussed the influence that the idealism of scientific inquiry had on the volunteers. He remarked: \"The influence is ideological. It's about what they believe science to be, that science is a positive product, it produces beneficial findings and knowledge to society that are helpful for society. So there's that sense of science is providing some kind of system for good.\"\n\nBuilding on the importance of idealism, some recent researchers suggest the 'engaged followership' perspective. Based on an examination of Milgram's archive, in a recent study, social psychologists Alexander Haslam, Stephen Reicher and Megan Birney, at the University of Queensland, discovered that people are less likely to follow the prods of an experimental leader when the prod resembles an order. However, when the prod stresses the importance of the experiment for science (i.e. 'The experiment requires you to continue'), people are more likely to obey. The researchers suggest the perspective of 'engaged followership': that people are not simply obeying the orders of a leader, but instead are willing to continue the experiment because of their desire to support the scientific goals of the leader and because of a lack of identification with the learner. Also a neuroscientific study supports this perspective, namely watching the learner receive electric shocks, does not activate brain regions involving empathic concerns.\n\nIn \"\" (1974), Milgram describes nineteen variations of his experiment, some of which had not been previously reported.\n\nSeveral experiments varied the distance between the participant (teacher) and the learner. Generally, when the participant was physically closer to the learner, the participant's compliance decreased. In the variation where the learner's physical immediacy was closest, where the participant had to hold the learner's arm onto a shock plate, 30 percent of participants completed the experiment. The participant's compliance also decreased if the experimenter was physically further away (Experiments 1–4). For example, in Experiment 2, where participants received telephonic instructions from the experimenter, compliance decreased to 21 percent. Some participants deceived the experimenter by \"pretending\" to continue the experiment.\n\nIn Experiment 8, an all-female contingent was used; previously, all participants had been men. Obedience did not significantly differ, though the women communicated experiencing higher levels of stress.\n\nExperiment 10 took place in a modest office in Bridgeport, Connecticut, purporting to be the commercial entity \"Research Associates of Bridgeport\" without apparent connection to Yale University, to eliminate the university's prestige as a possible factor influencing the participants' behavior. In those conditions, obedience dropped to 47.5 percent, though the difference was not statistically significant.\n\nMilgram also combined the effect of authority with that of conformity. In those experiments, the participant was joined by one or two additional \"teachers\" (also actors, like the \"learner\"). The behavior of the participants' peers strongly affected the results. In Experiment 17, when two additional teachers refused to comply, only 4 of 40 participants continued in the experiment. In Experiment 18, the participant performed a subsidiary task (reading the questions via microphone or recording the learner's answers) with another \"teacher\" who complied fully. In that variation, 37 of 40 continued with the experiment.\n\nAround the time of the release of \"Obedience to Authority\" in 1973–1974, a version of the experiment was conducted at La Trobe University in Australia. As reported by Perry in her 2012 book \"Behind the Shock Machine\", some of the participants experienced long-lasting psychological effects, possibly due to the lack of proper debriefing by the experimenter.\n\nIn 2002, the British artist Rod Dickinson created \"The Milgram Re-enactment\", an exact reconstruction of parts of the original experiment, including the uniforms, lighting, and rooms used. An audience watched the four-hour performance through one-way glass windows. A video of this performance was first shown at the CCA Gallery in Glasgow in 2002.\n\nA partial replication of the experiment was staged by British illusionist Derren Brown and broadcast on UK's Channel 4 in \"The Heist \"(2006).\n\nAnother partial replication of the experiment was conducted by Jerry M. Burger in 2006 and broadcast on the Primetime series \"Basic Instincts\". Burger noted that \"current standards for the ethical treatment of participants clearly place Milgram's studies out of bounds.\" In 2009, Burger was able to receive approval from the institutional review board by modifying several of the experimental protocols. Burger found obedience rates virtually identical to those reported by Milgram in 1961–62, even while meeting current ethical regulations of informing participants. In addition, half the replication participants were female, and their rate of obedience was virtually identical to that of the male participants. Burger also included a condition in which participants first saw another participant refuse to continue. However, participants in this condition obeyed at the same rate as participants in the base condition.\n\nIn the 2010 French documentary \"Le Jeu de la Mort\" (\"The Game of Death\"), researchers recreated the Milgram experiment with an added critique of reality television by presenting the scenario as a game show pilot. Volunteers were given €40 and told they would not win any money from the game, as this was only a trial. Only 16 of 80 \"contestants\" (teachers) chose to end the game before delivering the highest-voltage punishment.\n\nThe experiment was performed on \"Dateline NBC\" on an episode airing April 25, 2010.\n\nThe Discovery Channel aired the \"How Evil are You\" segment of \"Curiosity\" on October 30, 2011. The episode was hosted by Eli Roth, who produced results similar to the original Milgram experiment, though the highest-voltage punishment used was 165 volts, rather than 450 volts.\n\nDue to increasingly widespread knowledge of the experiment, recent replications of the procedure have had to ensure that participants were not previously aware of it.\n\nCharles Sheridan and Richard King (at the University of Missouri and the University of California, Berkeley, respectively) hypothesized that some of Milgram's subjects may have suspected that the victim was faking, so they repeated the experiment with a real victim: a \"cute, fluffy puppy\" who was given real, albeit apparently harmless, electric shocks. Their findings were similar to those of Milgram: half of the male subjects and all of the females obeyed throughout. Many subjects showed high levels of distress during the experiment, and some openly wept. In addition, Sheridan and King found that the duration for which the shock button was pressed decreased as the shocks got higher, meaning that for higher shock levels, subjects were more hesitant.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33826251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33826251", "title": "Neural basis of self", "text": "Neural basis of self\n\nThe neural basis of self is the idea of using modern concepts of neuroscience to describe and understand the biological processes that underlie human's perception of self-understanding. The neural basis of self is closely related to the psychology of self with a deeper foundation in neurobiology.\n\nIn order to understand how the human mind makes the human perception of self, there are different experimental techniques. One of the more common methods of determining brain areas that pertain to different mental processes is by using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. fMRI data is often used to determine activation levels in portions of the brain. fMRI measures blood flow in the brain. Areas with higher blood flow as shown on fMRI scans are said to be activated. This is due to the assumption that portions of the brain receiving increased blood flow are being used more heavily during the moment of scanning.\nPositron emission tomography is another method used to study brain activity.\n\nTwo areas of the brain that are important in retrieving self-knowledge are the medial prefrontal cortex and the medial posterior parietal cortex.\nThe posterior cingulate cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex are thought to combine to provide humans with the ability to self-reflect. The insular cortex is also thought to be involved in the process of self-reference.\n\nThe sense of embodiment is critical to a person’s conception of self. Embodiment is the understanding of the physical body and its relation to oneself. The study of human embodiment currently has a large impact on the study of human cognition as a whole. The current study of embodiment suggests that sensory input and experiences impact human’s overall perception. This idea somewhat challenges previous ideas of human cognition because it challenges the idea of the human mind being innate.\n\nThere are two portions of the brain that have recently been found to have a large importance on a person’s perception of self. The temporoparietal junction, located in the cortex is one of these brain regions. The temporoparietal junction is thought to integrate sensory information. The second portion of the brain thought to be involved in perception of embodiment is the extrastriate body area. The extrastriate body area is located in the lateral occipitotemporal cortex. When people are shown images of body parts, the extrastriate body area is activated. The temporoparietal junction is involved in sensory integration processes while the extrastriate body area deals mainly with thoughts of and exposure to human body parts. It has been found that the brain responds to stimuli that involve embodiment differently from stimuli that involve localization. During task performance tests, a person’s body position (whether he or she is sitting or laying face up) affects how the extrastriate body area is activated. The temporoparietal junction, however, is not affected by a person’s particular body position. The temporoparietal junction deals with disembodied rather than embodied self-location, explaining why a person’s physical position does not affect its activation. Self-location as related to a person’s sense of embodiment is related to his or her actual location in space.\n\nThe information people remember as autobiographical memory is essential to their perception of self. These memories form the way people feel about themselves. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex are involved in the memory of autobiographical information.\n\nMorality is an extremely important defining factor for humans. It often defines or contributes to people’s choices or actions, defining who a person is. Making moral decisions, much like other neural processes has a clear biological basis. The anterior and medial prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus are activated when people feel guilt, compassion, or embarrassment. Guilt and passion activate the mesolimbic pathway, and indignation and disgust are activated by the amygdala. There is clearly a network involved with the ideas of morality.\n\nIn order to explain how a human views him or herself, two different conceptual views of self-perception exist: the individualist and collectivistic views of self. The individualistic view of self involves people's perception of themselves as a stand-alone individual. This is thought of as a somewhat permanent perception of oneself that is unaffected by environmental and temporary cues and influences. People who view themselves in an individualistic sense describe themselves with personality traits that are permanent descriptions unrelated to particular situations. The collectivistic view of self, however, involves people's perception of themselves as members of a group or in a particular situation. The view people have of themselves in a collectivistic sense is entirely dependent on the situation they are in and the group with which they are interacting. These two ideas of self are also called self-construal styles.\nThere is neurobiological evidence supporting these two definitions of self-construal styles. fMRI data has been used to understand the biology of both the individualistic and collectivistic view of self. Certain people tend to view themselves in almost exclusively a collectivistic sense or an individualistic sense. When people have to describe themselves in a collectivistic way (as a part of a group), those who tend to view themselves collectivistically show greater fMRI activation in the medial prefrontal cortex than those who view themselves individualistically. The reverse is true when people describe themselves individualistically.\n\nThe study of the human mind in diseased states provides valuable insight into how the mind works in healthy individuals. A multitude of diseases are studied to understand altered perceptions of self and what causes these impairments.\n\nAutism is a disorder in which those affected experience impaired social interactions, communication, and behaviors. A new approach to studying autism is to focus on individuals’ perception of self rather than understanding the individual’s social interactions. A common thought is that understanding of the differences between the self and others are impaired. However, the exact biological mechanism of self-understanding in autistic children is currently unknown. It has been found that there are significant differences in brain activation in self and other situations in autistic children when compared to children who do not have autism. \nIn adults who do not have autism, during self-recognition tasks, the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule in the right hemisphere are activated. Children who do not have autism show activation in these areas when performing face processing tasks for their own faces and those of others. Children with autism, however, only show activation in these areas when recognizing their own faces. The activation in the inferior frontal gyrus is less in children with autism than in those who do not have autism.\n\nThe cortical midline structure is extremely important in the understanding of the self, especially during the task of self-reflection. Many researchers believe that self-reference plays a role in the expression of psychoses. The disturbance of the individual’s self may be underlying the manifestation of these psychoses. Occurrences such as hallucinations and delusions may originate with disruptions of a person’s perception of the self. Understanding the differences in those who have psychoses and those who do not can aid in diagnoses and treatment of those diseases. Those who are prone to psychoses such as schizophrenia, when describing positive traits about themselves show increased activation in the left insula, right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and left ventromedial prefrontal cortex. When they use negative traits to describe themselves, those who are prone to psychoses show higher activation in the bilateral insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.\n\nSometimes after strokes patients' perception of self changes. Often after a stroke, patients report their perception of self in more negative terms than before their stroke.\nIt has been found that humans’ ideas of themselves are established early in life but that the perception can change as others ideas are combined with their own. \nThere are differences in the areas activated during self-knowledge retrieval between adults and children. This suggests a difference in self-knowledge neurobiologically due to normal aging. The prefrontal cortex and the medial posterior parietal cortex have been found to be activated when adults perform self-knowledge retrieval processes. Tests consist of presenting subjects with self-description phrases and allowing the subject to respond yes or no depending on whether or not the phrase describes him or herself. During this task, patients brains are fMRI scanned. These results can then be compared to fMRI data of the same patients when they are asked if the same phrases describe another individual, such as a well-known fictional character. The medial prefrontal cortex is activated more strongly for subjects when they are describing themselves than when they are describing others. However, children show greater medial prefrontal cortex activation than adults when performing self-knowledge retrieval tasks. Additionally, children and adults activate different specific regions in the medial prefrontal cortex. Adults activate the posterior precuneus more while children activate the anterior precuneus and the posterior cingulate.\nThe understanding of the areas of the brain most frequently activated in children and adults can also provide information about how children, adolescents, and adults view themselves differently. Older children more significantly activate the medial prefrontal cortex because they deal with introspection much less frequently than adults and adolescents. Children have decreased specificity in skills than adults, so they show greater activation during spatial tasks. This is explained by the idea that with increased expertise in a task, decreased interest in wide spatial parameters occurs. When a person is an expert, he or she is able to be more focused in his or her performance. The difference in performance between adults and children is thought to be attributable to different perceptions of the self whether it is more introspective or more concerned with the surroundings and environment.\n"}
{"id": "3668693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3668693", "title": "Nilmanifold", "text": "Nilmanifold\n\nIn mathematics, a nilmanifold is a differentiable manifold which has a transitive nilpotent group of diffeomorphisms acting on it. As such, a nilmanifold is an example of a homogeneous space and is diffeomorphic to the quotient space formula_1, the quotient of a nilpotent Lie group \"N\" modulo a closed subgroup \"H\". This notion was introduced by A. Mal'cev in 1951.\n\nIn the Riemannian category, there is also a good notion of a nilmanifold. A Riemannian manifold is called a homogeneous nilmanifold if there exist a nilpotent group of isometries acting transitively on it. The requirement that the transitive nilpotent group acts by isometries leads to the following rigid characterization: every homogeneous nilmanifold is isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric (see Wilson ).\n\nNilmanifolds are important geometric objects and often arise as concrete examples with interesting properties; in Riemannian geometry these spaces always have mixed curvature, almost flat spaces arise as quotients of nilmanifolds, and compact nilmanifolds have been used to construct elementary examples of collapse of Riemannian metrics under the Ricci flow.\n\nIn addition to their role in geometry, nilmanifolds are increasingly being seen as having a role in arithmetic combinatorics (see Green–Tao ) and ergodic theory (see, e.g., Host–Kra ).\n\nA compact nilmanifold is a nilmanifold which is compact. One way to construct such spaces is to start with a simply connected nilpotent Lie group \"N\" and a discrete subgroup formula_2. If the subgroup formula_2 acts cocompactly (via right multiplication) on \"N\", then the quotient manifold formula_4 will be a compact nilmanifold. As Mal'cev has shown, every compact\nnilmanifold is obtained this way.\n\nSuch a subgroup formula_2 as above is called a lattice in \"N\". It is well known that a nilpotent Lie group admits a lattice if and only if its Lie algebra admits a basis with rational structure constants: this is Malcev's criterion. Not all nilpotent Lie groups admit lattices; for more details, see also Raghunathan.\n\nA compact Riemannian nilmanifold is a compact Riemannian manifold which is locally isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric. These spaces are constructed as follows. Let formula_2 be a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group \"N\", as above. Endow \"N\" with a left-invariant (Riemannian) metric. Then the subgroup formula_7 acts by isometries on \"N\" via left-multiplication. Thus the quotient formula_8 is a compact space locally isometric to \"N\". Note: this space is naturally diffeomorphic to formula_9.\n\nCompact nilmanifolds also arise as principal bundles. For example, consider a 2-step nilpotent Lie group \"N\" which admits a lattice (see above). Let formula_10 be the commutator subgroup of \"N\". Denote by p the dimension of \"Z\" and by q the codimension of \"Z\"; i.e. the dimension of \"N\" is p+q. It is known (see Raghunathan) that formula_11 is a lattice in \"Z\". Hence, formula_12 is a \"p\"-dimensional compact torus. Since \"Z\" is central in \"N\", the group G acts on the compact nilmanifold formula_13 with quotient space formula_14. This base manifold \"M\" is a \"q\"-dimensional compact torus. It has been shown that ever principal torus bundle over a torus is of this form, see. More generally, a compact nilmanifold is torus bundle, over a torus bundle, over...over a torus.\n\nAs mentioned above, almost flat manifolds are intimately compact nilmanifolds. See that article for more information.\n\nHistorically, a complex nilmanifold meant a quotient of a complex nilpotent Lie group over\na cocompact lattice. An example of such a nilmanifold is an Iwasawa manifold. From the 1980s, another (more general) notion of a complex nilmanifold gradually replaced this one.\n\nAn almost complex structure on a real Lie algebra \"g\" is an endomorphism formula_15 which squares to\n−Id. This operator is called a complex structure if its eigenspaces, corresponding to eigenvalues\nformula_16, are subalgebras in formula_17. In this case, \"I\" defines a left-invariant complex structure on the corresponding Lie group. Such a manifold (\"G\",\"I\") is called a complex group manifold.\nIt is easy to see that every connected complex homogeneous manifold equipped with a free, transitive, holomorphic action by a real Lie group is obtained this way.\n\nLet \"G\" be a real, nilpotent Lie group. A complex nilmanifold is a quotient of a complex group manifold (\"G\",\"I\"), equipped with a left-invariant complex structure, by a discrete, cocompact lattice, acting from the right.\n\nComplex nilmanifolds are usually not homogeneous, as complex varieties.\n\nIn complex dimension 2, the only complex nilmanifolds are a complex torus and a Kodaira surface.\n\nCompact nilmanifolds (except a torus) are never homotopy formal. This implies immediately that compact nilmanifolds (except a torus) cannot\nadmit a Kähler structure (see also ).\n\nTopologically, all nilmanifolds can be obtained\nas iterated torus bundles over a torus. This is easily seen from a filtration by ascending central series.\n\nFrom the above definition of homogeneous nilmanifolds, it is clear that any nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric is a homogeneous nilmanifold. The most familiar nilpotent Lie groups are matrix groups whose diagonal entries are 1 and whose lower diagonal entries are all zeros.\n\nFor example, the Heisenberg group is a 2-step nilpotent Lie group. This nilpotent Lie group is also special in that it admits a compact quotient. The group formula_7 would be the upper triangular matrices with integral coefficients. The resulting nilmanifold is 3-dimensional. One possible fundamental domain is (isomorphic to) [0,1] with the faces identified in a suitable way. This is because an element formula_19 of the nilmanifold can be represented by the element formula_20 in the fundamental domain. Here formula_21 denotes the floor function of \"x\", and formula_22 the fractional part. The appearance of the floor function here is a clue to the relevance of nilmanifolds to additive combinatorics: the so-called bracket polynomials, or generalised polynomials, seem to be important in the development of higher-order Fourier analysis.\n\nA simpler example would be any abelian Lie group. This is because any such group is a nilpotent Lie group. For example, one can take the group of real numbers under addition, and the discrete, cocompact subgroup consisting of the integers. The resulting 1-step nilmanifold is the familiar circle formula_23. Another familiar example might be the compact 2-torus or Euclidean space under addition.\n\nA parallel construction based on solvable Lie groups produces a class of spaces called solvmanifolds. An important example of a solvmanifolds are Inoue surfaces, known in complex geometry.\n"}
{"id": "38103316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38103316", "title": "Non-difference (Abheda)", "text": "Non-difference (Abheda)\n\nNon-difference, this word not to be found in the English Dictionary is the nearest English translation of the Sanskrit word, Abheda. The word, Abheda, means non-existence of difference. In Vedanta philosophy this word plays a vital role in explaining the indicatory mark in respect of the unity of the individual self with the Infinite or Brahman.\n\nAudolomi (Brahma Sutra I.iv.21) is believed to have held the view that the individual self differs from the supreme self while it possesses a body, but when a man obtains the clear knowledge by means of practice and meditation, dies, leaves the body and obtains complete liberation, the individual self becomes the supreme self, which means in liberation, there is no difference; in transmigration, there is difference; the absolutely different individual self becomes identical in the state of liberation. This is the non-identity non-difference theory of Audolomi. However, Kasakrtsna (Brahma Sutra I.iv.22) believed that the very supreme self exists as the individual soul without undergoing any change which view-point is supported by Badarayana when he reiterates that the individual is only an apparent part of the partless Brahman; the difference is imaginary. This is the non-duality non-difference theory of Kasakrtsna. In his commentary on the Brahma Sutra II.i.14 Adi Sankara explains that the difference between the 'experiencer' and the 'things experienced' which is observed in common experience, in reality does not exist, there is non-difference of cause and effect for all things are merely modifications, and \"a modification has speech as its origin and exists only in name\" (Chandogya Upanishad VI.i.4), and \"All this has That as its essence; That is the Reality; That is the Self; That thou art\" (Chandogya Upanishad Vi.vii.7); \"All this is but the Self\" (Chandogya Upanishad VII.xxv.2). Difference commonly observed is the creation of ignorance whereas non-difference is natural; when the individual ignorance is destroyed through knowledge unity with Self is attained – \"Anyone who knows that supreme Brahman becomes Brahman indeed\" (Mundaka Upanishad III.ii.9), \"Being but Brahman, he is absorbed in Brahman\" (Brhadaranyaka Upanishad IV.iv.6).\n\nIn Hindu philosophy according to the Doctrine of Non-difference (\"abheda\") there is no difference (\"bheda\") whatsoever between the individual self (atman) and the supreme Self (Paramatman) or (Brahman). The opinion of the Sruti is that the knowledge of oneness of Brahman and atman is \"samyag-jnana\" ( Vivekachudamani. 204). The word \"ekatvam\" in this sloka that reads - \"brahmatmaikatvavijnanam samyajjnanam sruter matam\" means \"non-difference\", the experience of this non-difference between Brahman (supreme Self) and atman (individual self) is \"samyag-jnana\". It is the person tainted by \"bhrama\" (\"delusion\") and \"pramada\" (\"carelessness\") who cannot determine what is \"samyag-jnana\" or \"true knowledge\". Right knowledge removes all products of \"ajnana\" (\"ignorance\"); \"ajnana\" is of the nature of \"Mithya\", hinting differences between atman and Brahman. Then, all phenomenal expressions imagined on Brahman are denied and Brahman stands out as outside the negation Neti neti.\n\nAccording to the Theory of the Pre-existent Effect, there is no annihilation of the existence, nor is there any creation of the non-existent, which means, there cannot be anything new or the destruction of what exists; and that there is no relation between cause and effect. With regard to the non-difference of the cause and the effect the general views are that, a) the difference (negation of non-difference) of the cause and effect is the essence (\"swarupa\") of the cause and the effect, and the non-difference of them is their relation of identity; b) that difference of cause and effect is their essential quality and that their non-difference is the negation of that difference, and c) that both difference and non-difference are essential qualities of the cause and effect and are equally positive in character and colour. These views lead to the reasoning that non-difference of the cause and effect cannot be taken as absolutely different from them, non-difference is not an attribute different from cause and effect and if difference is interpreted as constituting the essential nature of the cause and effect, with non-difference qualifying it as an attribute then a rational conception of the relation between cause and effect cannot be formed. It is held that the effect before its manifestation remains undifferentiated in the cause, because the causal substance is the substance of the effect as a substance therefore, the effect cannot be different from the cause, it evolves out of the cause, it exists inseparable from the cause and at the time of destruction it merges in the nature of the cause. Also, specific features that constitute the effect are not different from the cause. Thus, the entire world which prior to its manifestation is existent in an unmanifest state in the nature of Prakrti, the Primal Energy, the modification of Prakrti resulting in the perceivable world does not make it lose its identity.\nExistence is a manifestation of the unmanifest Brahman, and the individual souls (atman) are the reflections of Brahman and non-different from Brahman, but even then non-difference cannot become the content of awareness without reference to difference. To the Advaitins, non-difference is real and it is not known through reasoning. Brahman is then held to be knowable because it is different from empirical things.\n\nNon-difference is the essential (\"svabhavika\") condition - \"He who knows the highest Brahman becomes Brahman Himself\" and \"Being Brahman he goes to Brahman\", while the distinction of souls from Brahman and each other is due to their limiting adjuncts (internal organs, sense-organs and the body), and the \"Upadhis\" that are produced, in accordance with the actions of the individual souls, as essentially non-different and different from Brahman.\nAdvaitins maintain the view that there is complete undividedness (\"akhandata\") or identity (\"tadatmya\") of the individual soul and Brahman; the former is the latter limited by artificial conditions (\"upadhis\"). According to Vijnanabhikshu, difference (\"bheda\") and non-difference (\"abheda\") can also be understood to mean separation (\"vibhaga\") and non-separation (\"avibhaga\").e.g. pure water poured into pure water. The statements that reject difference have as their concern \"difference\" in the sense of non-separation. As regards the difference in the sense of non-separation Brihadaranyaka Upanishad explains that the essence of that which is gross, mortal, limited and defined is the eye for it is the essence of the defined which means, the mental mode associated with comparison that gives rise to duality and multiplicity i.e. separateness, is connected with the eye. The essence of that which is subtle, immortal, unlimited, unchanging and undefined is the unseeable being that is in the right-eye. Similarly the defined is the Sun but the undefined is that which moves within the Sun.\n\nWith regard the meaning of Brahma Sutra II.i.15 which reads \"bhave cha uplabhdheha\", Adi Shankara explains that it means - the effect is non-different from the cause for this further reason, that the effect is perceived when the cause is there, but not otherwise, it also means that not only is the non-difference of the cause and effect to be accepted on the authority of scriptures, their non-difference is also to be accepted on the strength of the existence of such a perception; for direct perception does occur about the non-difference of the cause and effect. And, with regard the interpretation of Brahma Sutra III.ii.22, Adi Shankara explains that neither the form of Brahman consisting of the phenomenal manifestations can be denied, nor Brahman, the possessor of form, for that would lead to nihilism. And that the unreal can only be denied on the basis of something real. Since the Sruti insists that Brahman is to be realized as existing failing to reach which, words turn back with the mind ( it is the phenomenal expression alone of Brahman is denied and not Brahman which appears to be different during activity, yet intrinsically there is non-difference, mark the Mahavakya, Tat tvam asi and the Sruti vakya, \"There is no other witness but Him\". The individual self, which is non-different from the supreme Self i.e. Brahman, does not become liberated so long as it persists to be by nature an agent and experience when at the same time that its identity with Brahman, realizable through knowledge, does not exist “because when there is duality, as it were, then one sees something” “but when to the knower of Brahman everything has become the Self, then what should one see and through what?”\n"}
{"id": "3295963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3295963", "title": "Objet petit a", "text": "Objet petit a\n\nIn the psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan, objet petit a stands for the unattainable object of desire. It is sometimes called the object cause of desire. Lacan always insisted that the term should remain untranslated, \"thus acquiring the status of an algebraic sign\" (\"Écrits\").\n\n'The \"a\" in question stands for \"autre\" (other), the concept having been developed out of the Freudian \"object\" and Lacan's own exploitation of \"otherness.\" \n\nJacques-Alain Miller pointed to the origins of object (a) in Freud's 'lost object...the function that Freud discovered in the \"Three Essays\"...and that Karl Abraham made the crux of his theory of development from which he derived the first premises of the \"partial object\"'.\n\nThereafter, according to Miller, Melanie Klein 'located the partial object at the centre of psychic economy...hence it was that Winnicott glimpsed the transitional object.' That long prehistory of object relations 'is what Lacan sums up, condenses, justifies and constructs with object \"a\".' \n\n'In Lacan's seminars of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the evolving concept of the \"objet (petit) a\" is viewed in the \"matheme\" of phantasy as the object of desire sought in the other...a deliberate departure from British Object Relations psychoanalysis'.\n\nIn 1957, in his Seminar \"Les formations de l'inconscient\", Lacan introduces the concept of \"objet petit a\" as the (Kleinian) imaginary part-object, an element which is imagined as separable from the rest of the body. In the Seminar \"Le transfert\" (1960–1961) he articulates objet a with the term \"agalma\" (Greek, an ornament). Just as the \"agalma\" is a precious object hidden in a worthless box, so \"objet petit a\" is the object of desire which we seek in the Other. The \"box\" can take many forms, all of which are unimportant, the importance lies in what is \"inside\" the box, the cause of desire.\n\nIn the Seminars \"L'angoisse\" (1962–1963) and The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis (1964), \"objet petit a\" is defined as the leftover, the remnant left behind by the introduction of the Symbolic in the Real. This is further elaborated in the Seminar \"The Other Side of Psychoanalysis\" (1969–1970), where Lacan elaborates his Four discourses. In the discourse of the Master, one signifier attempts to represent the subject for all other signifiers, but a surplus is always produced: this surplus is \"objet petit a\", a surplus meaning, a surplus of jouissance.\n\nSlavoj Žižek explains this \"objet petit a\" in relation to Alfred Hitchcock's MacGuffin: \"[The] MacGuffin is \"objet petit a\" pure and simple: the lack, the remainder of the Real that sets in motion the symbolic movement of interpretation, a hole at the center of the symbolic order, the mere appearance of some secret to be explained, interpreted, etc.\" (\"Love thy symptom as thyself\").\n\nSpeaking of the \"fall\" of the \"a\", Lacan noted that 'the diversity of forms taken by that object of the fall ought to be related to the manner in which the desire of the Other is apprehended by the subject.' The earliest form is 'something that is called the breast...this breast in its function as object, \"object a\" cause of desire.' \n\nNext there emerges 'the second form: the anal object. We know it by way of the phenomenology of the gift, the present offered in anxiety.' The third form appears 'at the level of the genital act...[where] Freudian teaching, and the tradition that has maintained it, situates for us the gaping chasm of castration.' \n\nLacan also identified 'the function of \"petit a\" at the level of the scopophilic drive. Its essence is realized in so far as, more than elsewhere, the subject is captive of the function of desire.' The final term relates to 'the \"petit a\" source of the superego...the fifth term of the function of \"petit a\", through which will be revealed the gamut of the object in its - pregenital - relation to the demand of the - post-genital - Other.' \n\nFor transference to take place, the analyst must incorporate the \"a\" for the analysand: 'analysts who are such only insofar as they are object - the object of the analysand'. For Lacan, 'it is not enough that the analyst should support the function of Tiresias. He must also, as Apollinaire tells us, have breasts' - must represent or incorporate the (missing) object of desire.\n\nWorking through the transference thereafter entails moving 'beyond the function of the \"a\"': the 'analyst has to...be the support of the separating \"a\",' so as to allow the analysis eventually to be completed. 'If the analyst during the analysis will come to be this object, he will also at the end of analysis not be it. He will submit himself to the fate of any object that stands in for \"a\", and that is to be discarded.' \n\n"}

{"id": "31462942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31462942", "title": "Paying for It", "text": "Paying for It\n\nPaying for It, \"a comic strip memoir about being a john\", is a 2011 graphic novel by Canadian cartoonist Chester Brown. A combination of memoir and polemic, the book explores Brown's decision to give up on romantic love and to take up the life of a \"john\" by frequenting prostitutes. The book, published by Drawn and Quarterly, was controversial, and a bestseller.\n\nThe book is concerned with Brown's conflicting desire to have sex, but not wanting to have another girlfriend after his partner Sook-Yin Lee breaks up with him. His solution is to forgo traditional boyfriend/girlfriend relationships and marriage. He takes up frequenting prostitutes, and comes to advocate prostitution as superior and to \"possessive monogamy\" of traditional male–female relations, which he debates with his friends throughout the book.\n\nBrown presents his views in detail in the closing 50-page text section, which includes a 23-part appendix, end notes, and a note from friend and fellow cartoonist Seth. Despite being about the separation of sex from romantic love, Brown calls the book \"a type of love story\".\n\nAfter then-girlfriend Sook-Yin Lee breaks up with him in 1996, Brown, who lacks the social skills to pick up women, spends a celibate three years mulling over what he sees as the negative aspects of romantic love in the modern world. He continues to live with Sook-Yin, even after she brings other men to live with them, and Brown witnesses their lovers' spats. He decides never to pursue a relationship with any one woman again — a condition he calls \"possessive monogamy\"—but he has \"two competing desires -- the desire to have sex, versus the desire to NOT have a girlfriend.\"\n\nEventually, he works up the courage to see a prostitute. He rides around on his bicycle looking for streetwalkers, but being unsuccessful, turns to the ads in the backs of free alternative newspapers. After his first experience, he feels free from a \"burden\" he has carried from adolescence.\n\nOver the course of 33 chapters, Brown depicts his experiences with each of the 23 prostitutes he has visited, giving each at least a chapter of her own. He gives details of their physical features and sexual performances, while obscuring their faces and ethnicities and giving them false names. He \"becomes an expert\" and goes into the details of the trade, learning how to solicit and tip, and what the abbreviations in johns' reviews at the Toronto escort review board mean. At first he uses the pseudonym \"Steve McDougal\" in his encounters, but, feeling he has nothing to hide, soon reverts to using his real name.\n\nBetween his encounters with prostitutes are scenes of himself discussing and debating the issue with his friends, especially fellow cartoonists Seth and Joe Matt. Much of the humour in the book comes from the dialogue in these scenes.\n\nIn the final chapter, \"Back to Monogamy\", he ends up with one particular prostitute, \"Denise\" (albeit in a strictly financial way) for seven years as of the book's publication. Brown ends the book still wondering about the nature of love, and insisting that \"paying for sex isn’t an empty experience if you’re paying the right person for sex\", but leaves the question of romantic love essentially open.\n\nThe book comes with a 50-page text section, including a bibliography, footnotes and an appendix in 23 parts that argues for a system in which \"paying for sex is preferable to romance-based methods\". It includes some commentary by his friend and fellow cartoonist Seth, who disagrees with Brown's position and accuses him of having no emotions, but then goes on to say, \"The funny thing about Chester is that out of all the men I know he’s quite possibly the one I think would make the most considerate boyfriend or husband for a woman...and yet he is the one who picked the whoring.\"\n\nThe appendices underscore the book's \"political undercurrent\", motivated by people's prejudices against those who buy and sell sex. Brown says he wanted a book that presented the john's side of things, as he does not see himself as an \"evil monster\", and wants people to understand his perspective.\n\nBrown says he doesn't expect every reader to read through all of the text portions of the book, and that he himself rarely reads the notes or appendices in the books he reads. He said, \"I wanted the material to be there for anyone who wanted a bit of background or to know what I thought about a particular subject in more depth.\"\n\nBrown is a libertarian and ran as the Libertarian Party of Canada candidate for the Trinity-Spadina riding in the Canadian federal elections of 2008 and 2011. Brown takes the position throughout the book and its lengthy appendix that prostitution should be decriminalized, and as a libertarian insists the sex trade should not be regulated by the government.\n\nThe book was on the verge of completion when Ontario judge Susan Himel struck down several prostitution-related laws in September 2010, which was to be appealed by the government of Canada in June 2011. \"I was wishing that the book was out at that point,[...b]ut I hope it becomes influential enough to become part of the debate,\" Brown said.\n\nThe book's release party was on May 1, 2011, the day before the Canadian federal election of that year, in which Brown was running as the Libertarian Party of Canada candidate for the Trinity-Spadina riding. The election was called early after a motion of no confidence on March 25 resulted in the dissolution of Parliament. \"Initially, I was a bit annoyed by the timing of the election,\" Brown said, \"but it might turn out to be a good thing that I’m getting publicity at this time.\" Brown came fifth in his riding with 454 votes, losing to incumbent Olivia Chow.\n\nBrown employs a \"clinical\" style with pages structured in an eight-panel grid which may have been inspired by the comics of Carl Barks, and which \"he never veers from\" (somewhat like the six-panel pages he used in \"\"), \"using frail, tiny figures, preventing our involvement with the bodies depicted on the page.\" The women's faces are obscured by word balloons. Brown says that over the years he has \"become less comfortable portraying emotion,\" and went so far as to scrap 30–40 pages of work around 2007 when he felt he had put too much emotion in the artwork.\n\nWhile Brown himself has been totally open about his visits with prostitutes, all the prostitutes in the book are depicted as \"faceless brunettes\", in order to keep the real women in the story from being identified by friends and family. Brown speculates that a prose treatment may have had an advantage, in that it would not have required such an intrusive device to disguise the women.\n\nBrown says he wanted the minimalist style of the drawings to convey the ordinariness of paying for sex. It is also his first major work to break from the traditional all-caps style of lettering in English-language comic books and strips.\n\nBrown depicts himself showing little or no emotion. In a scene in which he debates prostitutes' health care with Seth, his outrage surfaces not in his face, but in a thought balloon in which a thunderstorm rages and takes over the panel. It has been noted that, although Brown depicts himself as dry and emotionless, in real life he has a ready sense of humour.\n\nBrown moved his drawing away from the overt Harold Gray influence (as seen in \"Louis Riel\" and \"Underwater\") towards a style inspired by the \"very stylized, stiff look\" of Fletcher Hanks. Close friend Joe Matt also had an influence. Some scenes deliberately echoed scenes in Matt's graphic novel \"Spent\". He set scenes in places that had been depicted in Matt's comics, and did his own take on a restaurant scene that Matt had done.\n\nBrown cites the \"austerity\" of the films of Robert Bresson, who \"instructed his actors not to show any emotion on their faces\", as a major influence.\n\nWhile Brown had explored autobiography in the past, he makes clear that advocacy is the prime motivation for the book. He says that, if he had thought a fictional treatment would have served his purposes better, then that would have been the route he would have taken. He had considered that angle, but in the end decided that he wanted to make it clear that he had a personal stake in the issue based on his own experiences as a john.\n\n\"New York Times\" critic Dwight Garner compared Brown's pro-prostitution position to that of political philosopher Martha Nussbaum. He also puts forward the idea that feminists should be more consistent when it comes to the right to choose — as with abortion, \"it's her body, it's her right\".\n\nBrown has focused on his problems with relating to women in previous works, most notably in his books \"\" and \"I Never Liked You\".\n\nBrown began to question traditional male–female relations after he had read \"Cerebus\" #186, which contained an essay attacking the modern state of such relations. After Sook-Yin Lee broke up with him, he felt that he no longer wanted to deal with the tensions of being in a boyfriend–girlfriend relationship. After three years of staying celibate, he decided he would start seeing prostitutes, although at first he was hesitant, as he did not want to be seen as a \"loser\".\n\nBrown made his visiting of prostitutes known to his friends and relatives (except for his stepmother) shortly after his first visit, and it had been made public long before the appearance of \"Paying for It\", as in his interview with Dave Sim in \"Cerebus\" #295–297, That he had been working on a graphic novel on the subject had been known in comics circles at least since 2004 when, in an interview with \"The Pulse\", he says he explores some of René Girard's theories of the origin of desire in his then-yet-unnamed book, and its appearance was much anticipated.\n\nBrown's aversion to relationships with women drew tentative comparisons to friend and fellow cartoonist Dave Sim, known for his controversial views on women. Brown responded to this by saying, \"...I don't think women are intellectually inferior to men. But I like being alone.\" Brown also publicly debated the subject with Sim in the \"Getting Riel\" interview, while acknowledging that \"Cerebus #186 [\"the issue in which Sim first laid out his controversial views\"] did push me in the direction of questioning the whole romantic relationship thing\".\n\nBrown had originally intended the book to cover the history of his sex life, including losing his virginity and going through all his girlfriends, but two of his former girlfriends with whom he was still friends (Sook-Yin Lee and the Kris of \"Helder\", \"Showing Helder\" and \"The Playboy\") objected to their stories being told in his book. He also intended to include more details of the prostitutes he visited, such as their interests and the conversations they had, but was afraid too much detail could identify them — he chose to respect their anonymity; this includes \"Denise\", the prostitute with whom he ended up having a long-term, monogamous relationship, and who refused to have more of herself included in the book. Brown did not try to contact the other prostitutes about their portrayals.\n\nConversations and debates with Dave Sim were also dropped, as their friendship fell through over Brown's refusal to sign an online petition asserting Sim was not a misogynist, it would have been awkward for him to ask Sim for permission to include those scenes.\n\n\nWhile it was not surprising that a work by a cartoonist of Brown's standing would receive accolades from his peers and critics (being called \"some of the best comics of Brown’s career\" and \"book of the year\"), neither was it surprising that the book would be the focus of controversy. The subject matter and Brown's didactic approach to it were expected from the outset to draw fire, but some found Brown's approach to have more aesthetic repercussions:\n\nThe advocacy displayed in the voluminous pages of the appendix may have been a detriment to the work overall, according to Tom Spurgeon at The Comics Reporter; \"Give me scenes like the one where Brown argues with Seth over the issues, seething and impatient with Seth's answers and his own, desperate and human in wanting to make and win such discussions, over any number of facile dissections of each argument's actual merits.\" Brad MacKay of \"The Globe and Mail\" found that them \"often amusing\" and \"thought-provoking,\" but sometimes \"reductive and didactic.\" Critic R. Fiore found that Brown doesn't argue points well.\n\nObscuring the faces of the prostitutes could be seen as Brown objectifying them, and with a feeling the book lacks a female perspective, \"especially since all we see of them is their frequently naked bodies.\" Brown has also been criticized for treading lightly over darker issues, like human trafficking, an oversight he acknowledges yet largely dismisses in the appendix; and class, one he barely acknowledges. Matt Seneca objected to paying for the book, as he felt the money would indirectly pay for the exploitation of prostitutes. Brown also raised eyebrows by claiming physical drug addiction doesn't exist.\n\nIn May 2012, Sook-Yin Lee told \"Ottawa Magazine\" that she would be directing a film adaptation of \"Paying for It\". The script was being prepared by Lee, Brown and Adam Litovitz, with an eye towards making the story less didactic and episodic.\n\nThe book was the first of Brown's books not to be serialized. Brown originally intended \"Louis Riel\" to be published this way, but was convinced by Drawn and Quarterly editor-in-chief Chris Oliveros to publish it as a series. Following poor sales of the \"Louis Riel\" comic-book serialization, Oliveros relented and gave Brown the go-ahead to publish \"Paying For It\" directly in book form. It was supported, as \"Louis Riel\" was, by a grant from the Canada Council for the Arts, this time for CAD $16,000 which he received in 2005.\n\nThe title was not what Brown would have wanted. He wanted to have a more direct title that used words like \"sex\", \"prostitute\" or \"trick\". Some of the titles he floated around were \"I Pay for Sex\" or \"The Sex Life of John Brown\" but his publishers asked him to call it \"Paying for It\", a title which rubbed him the wrong way, as \"[i]t suggests that not only am I paying for sex but I’m also paying for being a john in some non-monetary way. Many would think that there’s an emotional cost — that johns are sad and lonely...I haven’t been 'paying for it' in any of those ways. I’m very far from being sad or lonely, I haven’t caught an S-T-D, I haven’t been arrested, I haven’t lost my career, and my friends and family haven’t rejected me.\" He says that if he had insisted, Drawn and Quarterly would have allowed him to call the book what he wanted, but Brown allowed the change of title, acknowledging how difficult the book would be to market.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Louis Riel\", Drawn and Quarterly anticipated high sales, printing nearly 20,000 copies of the first, hardcover edition of the book, for its May 3, 2011 release. The introduction was by famous underground cartoonist Robert Crumb, and the book includes quotes from Brown's peers such as Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman, as well as from writer and former call-girl Tracy Quan, sex columnist Sasha, and a number of academics.\n\nThe book reached #2 on Amazon's \"Bestsellers in Graphic Novels\" list, and on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list it debuted at #2 on the \"Hardcover Graphic Books\" list and reached #1 that July.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "839045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=839045", "title": "Phronesis", "text": "Phronesis\n\nPhronesis () is an Ancient Greek word for a type of wisdom or intelligence. It is more specifically a type of wisdom relevant to practical action, implying both good judgement and excellence of character and habits, or practical virtue. Phronesis was a common topic of discussion in ancient Greek philosophy. \n\nThe word was used in Greek philosophy, and such discussions are still influential today. In Aristotelian ethics, for example in the \"Nicomachean Ethics\", it is distinguished from other words for wisdom and intellectual virtues – such as \"episteme\" and \"techne\". Because of its practical character, when it is not simply translated by words meaning wisdom or intelligence, it is often translated as \"practical wisdom\", and sometimes (more traditionally) as \"prudence\", from Latin . Thomas McEvilley has proposed that the best translation is \"mindfulness\".\n\nIn some of his dialogues, Plato showed his teacher Socrates proposing that having \"phronēsis\" is the same as being a virtuous person. By thinking with \"phronēsis\", a person has virtue. Therefore, all virtuousness is a form of phronēsis. In the mind of Socrates \"phronēsis\" equals virtue, they are the same thing. Being good, is to be an intelligent or reasonable person with intelligent and reasonable thoughts. \"Phronēsis\" allows a person to have moral or ethical strength.\n\nIn Plato's Meno, Socrates explains how \"phronēsis\", a quality synonymous with \"moral understanding\", is the most important attribute to learn, although it cannot be taught and is instead gained through the development of the understanding of one's own self.\n\nIn the 6th book of his \"Nicomachean Ethics\", Plato's student and friend Aristotle famously distinguished between two intellectual virtues: \"sophia\" (wisdom) and \"phronesis\", and described the relationship between them and other intellectual virtues. \"Sophia\" is a combination of nous, the ability to discern reality, and \"epistēmē\", a type of knowledge which is logically built up and teachable, and which is sometimes equated with science. This involves reasoning concerning universal truths. \"Phronesis\" involves not only the ability to decide how to achieve a certain end, but also the ability to reflect upon and determine good ends consistent with the aim of living well overall.\n\nAristotle points out that although \"sophia\" is higher and more serious than \"phronesis\", the highest pursuit of wisdom and happiness requires both, because \"phronesis\" facilitates \"sophia\". He also associates \"phronesis\" with political ability.\n\nAccording to Aristotle's theory of rhetoric, \"phronesis\" is one of the three types of appeal to character (\"ethos\"). The other two are respectively appeals to \"arete\" (virtue) and \"eunoia\" (goodwill).\n\nGaining \"phronesis\" requires experience, according to Aristotle who wrote that:...although the young may be experts in geometry and mathematics and similar branches of knowledge [\"sophoi\"], we do not consider that a young man can have Prudence [\"phronimos\"]. The reason is that Prudence [\"phronesis\"] includes a knowledge of particular facts, and this is derived from experience, which a young man does not possess; for experience is the fruit of years.\n\n\"Phronesis\" is concerned with particulars, because it is concerned with how to act in particular situations. One can learn the principles of action, but applying them in the real world, in situations one could not have foreseen, requires experience of the world. For example, if one knows that one should be honest, one might act in certain situations in ways that cause pain and offense; knowing how to apply honesty in balance with other considerations and in specific contexts requires experience.\n\nAristotle holds that having \"phronesis\" is both necessary and sufficient for being virtuous; because \"phronesis\" is practical, it is impossible to be both \"phronetic\" and akratic; i.e., prudent persons cannot act against their \"better judgement.\"\n\nIn light of his fundamental ontology, Martin Heidegger interprets Aristotle in such a way that \"phronesis\" (and practical philosophy as such) is the original form of knowledge and thus primary to \"sophia\" (and theoretical philosophy).\n\nHeidegger interprets the \"Nicomachean Ethics\" as an ontology of Human Existence. The practical philosophy of Aristotle is a guiding thread in his Analysis of Existence according to which facticity names our unique mode of being in the world. Through his ‘existential analytic’, Heidegger recognises that ‘Aristotelian phenomenology’ suggests three fundamental movements of life including \"póiesis\", \"práxis\", \"theoría\" and that these have three corresponding dispositions: \"téchne\", \"phrónesis\" and \"sophía\". Heidegger considers these as modalities of Being inherent in the structure of \"‘Dasein’\" as being-in-the-world that is situated within the context of concern and care. According to Heidegger phronesis in Aristotle’s work discloses the right and proper way to be \"Dasein\". Heidegger sees phronesis as a mode of comportment in and toward the world, a way of orienting oneself and thus of caring-seeing-knowing and enabling a particular way of being concerned. \n\nWhile \"techne\" is a way of being concerned with things and principles of production and theoria a way of being concerned with eternal principles, phronesis is a way of being concerned with one’s life (qua action) and with the lives of others and all particular circumstances as purview of praxis. Phronesis is a disposition or habit, which reveals the being of the action while deliberation is the mode of bringing about the disclosive appropriation of that action. In other words, deliberation is the way in which the phronetic nature of \"Dasein’s\" insight is made manifest. \n\nPhronesis is a form of circumspection, connected to conscience and resoluteness respectively being-resolved in action of human existence (\"Dasein\") as \"práxis\". As such it discloses the concrete possibilities of being in a situation, as the starting point of meaningful action, processed with resolution, while facing the contingencies of life.\nHowever Heidegger’s ontologisation has been criticised as closing \"práxis\" within a horizon of solipsistic decision that deforms its political sense that is its practico-political configuration (Volpi, 2007).\nIn \"After Virtue\", Alasdair MacIntyre called for a phronetic social science. He points out that for every prediction made by a social scientific theory there are usually counter-examples. Hence the unpredictability of human beings and human life requires a focus on practical experiences.\n\n\n"}

The areas have governments that are unable or unwilling to enforce maritime laws. This creates favorable conditions for piracy.\n\nThese havens were often near maritime shipping lanes. Although some havens were merely hidden coves, some were established by governments who employed privateers to disrupt the overseas trade of rival nations.\n\nSome historic pirate havens included Barataria Bay, Port Royal, and Tortuga. These provided some autonomy for privateers and buccaneers.\n\nHistorically, the Barbary Coast contained a number of pirate havens, notably Salé, Algiers and Tunis. These pirate havens were used by Corsairs from the 16th to the 19th century. The pirates, dubbed \"Barbary Pirates\", ravaged European shipping and enslaved thousands of captives. The Pirate Republic of Salé, in 17th century Morocco, was a micronation with its own seaport argot known as \"Franco,\" since like other pirate states, it from time to time made treaties with European governments, agreeing not to attack their fleets.\n\nThe United States Navy was founded, in part, to counter the activities of the Barbary pirates, and the United States fought the First and Second Barbary Wars (1801–1805, 1815) to end this threat to its shipping.\n\nSome pirate havens were supposed to have formed anarchist societies called pirate utopias.\n\nIn the early 2000s piracy became common place off the coast of Somalia. During this period, pirate havens included Eyl, in the Puntland region of northern Somalia, and Harardhere (Xarard-heere), in the Mudug province of Somalia. During the same time period Transitional Federal Government of Somalia was believed to unable to enforce maritime laws. Other modern havens included Garaad and Hobyo in central Somalia.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10728155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10728155", "title": "Recognition-by-components theory", "text": "Recognition-by-components theory\n\nThe recognition-by-components theory, or RBC theory, is a bottom-up process proposed by Irving Biederman in 1987 to explain object recognition. According to RBC theory, we are able to recognize objects by separating them into \"geons\" (the object’s main component parts). Biederman suggested that geons are based on basic 3-dimensional shapes (cylinders, cones, etc.) that can be assembled in various arrangements to form a virtually unlimited number of objects.\n\nThe recognition-by-components theory suggests that there are fewer than 36 geons which are combined to create the objects we see in day-to-day life. For example, when looking at a mug we break it down into two components – “cylinder” and “handle”. This also works for more complex objects, which in turn are made up of a larger number of geons. Perceived geons are then compared with objects in our stored memory to identify what it is we are looking at. The theory proposes that when we view objects we look for two important components.\n\n\nIn his proposal of RBC, Biederman makes an analogy to the composition of speech and objects that helps support his theory. The idea is that about 44 individual phonemes or \"units of sound\" are needed to make up every word in the English language, and only about 55 are needed to make up every word in all languages. Though small differences may exist between these phonemes, there is still a discrete number that make up all languages.\n\nA similar system may be used to describe how objects are perceived. Biederman suggests that in the same way speech is made up by phonemes, objects are made up by geons, and as there are a great variance of phonemes, there is also a great variance of geons. It is more easily understood how 36 geons can compose the sum of all objects, when the sum of all language and human speech is made up of only 55 phonemes.\n\nOne of the most defining factors of the recognition-by-components theory is that it enables us to recognize objects regardless of viewing angle; this is known as viewpoint invariance. It is proposed that the reason for this effect is the invariant edge properties of geons.\n\nThe invariant edge properties are as follows:\n\nOur knowledge of these properties means that when viewing an object or geon, we can perceive it from almost any angle. For example, when viewing a brick we will be able to see horizontal sets of parallel lines and vertical ones, and when considering where these points meet (co-termination) we are able to perceive the object.\n\nUsing geons as structural primitives results in two key advantages. Because geons are based on object properties that are stable across viewpoint (\"viewpoint invariant\"), and all geons are discriminable from one another, a single geon description is sufficient to describe an object from all possible viewpoints. The second advantage is that considerable economy of representation is achieved: a relatively small set of geons form a simple \"alphabet\" that can combine to form complex objects. For example, with only 24 geons, there are 306 billion possible combinations of 3 geons, allowing for all possible objects to be recognized.\n\nIn addition, some research suggests that the ability to recognize geons and compound structures of geons may develop in the brain as early as four months old, making it one of the fundamental skills that infants use to perceive the world.\n\n\nRBC theory is not in itself capable of starting with a photograph of a real object and producing a geons-and-relations description of the object; the theory does not attempt to provide a mechanism to reduce the complexities of real scenes to simple geon shapes. RBC theory is also incomplete in that geons and the relations between them will fail to distinguish many real objects. For example, a pear and an apple are easily distinguished by humans, but lack the corners and edges needed for RBC theory to recognize they are different. However, Irving Biederman has argued that RBC theory is the \"preferred\" mode of human object recognition, with a secondary process handling objects that are not distinguishable by their geons. He further states that this distinction explains research suggesting that objects may or may not be recognized equally well with changes in viewpoint.\n"}
{"id": "18410383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18410383", "title": "Secular morality", "text": "Secular morality\n\nSecular morality is the aspect of philosophy that deals with morality outside of religious traditions. Modern examples include humanism, freethinking, and most versions of consequentialism. Additional philosophies with ancient roots include those such as skepticism and virtue ethics. Greg M. Epstein also states that, \"much of ancient Far Eastern thought is deeply concerned with human goodness without placing much if any stock in the importance of gods or spirits.\" An example is the non-denominational Kural text of Valluvar, an ancient Indian theistic poet-philosopher whose work remains secular. Other philosophers have proposed various ideas about how to determine right and wrong actions. An example is Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative.\n\nA variety of positions are apparent regarding the relationship between religion and morality. Some believe that religion is necessary as a guide to a moral life. According to some, this idea has been with us for nearly 2,000 years. Others suggest this idea goes back at least 2,600 years as exemplified in Psalm 14 of the Hebrew Bible. According to others, the idea goes back as far as 4,000 years, with the ancient Egyptians' 42 Principles of Ma'at. \n\nOthers eschew the idea that religion is required to provide a guide to right and wrong behavior. The \"Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics\" however states that religion and morality \"are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other\". Some believe that religions provide poor guides to moral behavior. Various commentators, such as Richard Dawkins (\"The God Delusion\"), Sam Harris (\"The End of Faith\") and Christopher Hitchens (\"God Is Not Great\") are among those who have asserted this view.\n\n\"Consequentialists\", as described by Peter Singer, \"start not with moral rules, but with goals. They assess actions by the extent to which they further those goals.\" Singer also notes that utilitarianism is \"the best-known, though not the only, consequentialist theory.\" Consequentialism is the class of normative ethical theories holding that the consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness of that conduct. Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence. In his 2010 book, \"The Moral Landscape\", Sam Harris describes a utilitarian science of morality.\n\nFreethought is a philosophical viewpoint that holds that opinions should be formed on the basis of science, logic, and reason, and should not be influenced by authority, tradition, or other dogmas. Freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of facts, scientific inquiry, and logical principles, independent of any logical fallacies or intellectually limiting effects of authority, confirmation bias, cognitive bias, conventional wisdom, popular culture, prejudice, sectarianism, tradition, urban legend, and all other dogmas.\n\nSecular humanism focuses on the way human beings can lead happy and functional lives. It posits that human beings are capable of being ethical and moral without religion or God, it neither assumes humans to be inherently evil or innately good, nor presents humans as \"above nature\" or superior to it. Rather, the humanist life stance emphasizes the unique responsibility facing humanity and the ethical consequences of human decisions. Fundamental to the concept of secular humanism is the strongly held viewpoint that ideology—be it religious or political—must be thoroughly examined by each individual and not simply accepted or rejected on faith. Along with this, an essential part of secular humanism is a continually adapting search for truth, primarily through science and philosophy.\n\nThe subject of secular morality has been discussed by prominent secular scholars as well as popular culture-based atheist and anti-religious writers. These include Paul Chamberlain's \"Can We Be Good Without God?\" (1996), Richard Holloway's \" Godless Morality: Keeping Religion Out of Ethics\" (1999), Robert Buckman's \"Can We Be Good Without God?\" (2002), Michael Shermer's \"The Science of Good and Evil\" (2004), Richard Dawkins's \"The God Delusion\" (2006), Christopher Hitchens's \"God Is Not Great\" (2007), Greg Epstein's \"Good Without God: What A Billion Nonreligious People \"Do\" Believe\" (2010), and Sam Harris's \"The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values\" (2011).\n\nAccording to Greg Epstein, \"the idea that we can't be 'good without God' \" has been with us for nearly 2,000 years. Others suggest this idea goes back further; for example in Psalm 14 of the Hebrew Bible which according to Hermann Gunkel date to the exile period of approximately 580 BCE. It states, \"The fool says in his heart, 'there is no God.' They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good ... not even one.\" \n\nFriedrich Nietzsche famously declared God is Dead but also warned \"When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident...Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole.\" \n\nThis idea is still present today. \"Many today ... argue that religious beliefs are necessary to provide moral guidance and standards of virtuous conduct in an otherwise corrupt, materialistic, and degenerate world.\" For example, Christian writer and medievalist C. S. Lewis made the argument in his popular book \"Mere Christianity\" that if a supernatural, objective standard of right and wrong does not exist outside of the natural world, then right and wrong becomes mired in the is-ought problem. Thus, he wrote, preferences for one moral standard over another become as inherently indefensible and arbitrary as preferring a certain flavor of food over another or choosing to drive on a certain side of a road. In the same vein, Christian theologian Ron Rhodes has remarked that \"it is impossible to distinguish evil from good unless one has an infinite reference point which is absolutely good.\" Peter Singer states that, \"Traditionally, the more important link between religion and ethics was that religion was thought to provide a reason for doing what is right, the reason being that those who are virtuous will be rewarded by an eternity of bliss while the rest roast in hell.\"\n\nProponents of theism argue that without a God or gods it is impossible to \"justify\" moral behavior on metaphysical grounds and thus to make a coherent case for abiding by moral standards. C. S. Lewis makes such an argument in \"Mere Christianity\". Peter Robinson, a political author and commentator with Stanford's Hoover Institution, has commented that, if an inner moral conscience is just another adaptive or evolved feeling in the human mind like simple emotional urges, then no inherent reason exists to consider morality as over and above other urges.\nAccording to Thomas Dixon, \"Religions certainly do provide a framework within which people can learn the difference between right and wrong.\"\n\nVarious commentators have stated that morality does not require religion as a guide. \"The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics\" states that, \"it is not hard to imagine a society of people that has no religion but has a morality, as well as a legal system, just because it says that people cannot live together without rules against killing, etc., and that it is not desirable for these all to be legally enforced. There have also certainly been people who have had a morality but no religious beliefs.\" Bernard Williams, an English philosopher, stated that the secular \"utilitarian outlook\"—a popular ethical position wherein the morally right action is defined as that action which effects the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people—is \"non-transcendental, and makes no appeal outside human life, in particular not to religious considerations.\" Williams also argued that, \"Either one's motives for following the moral word of God are moral motives, or they are not. If they are, then one is already equipped with moral motivations, and the introduction of God adds nothing extra. But if they are not moral motives, then they will be motives of such a kind that they cannot appropriately motivate \"morality\" at all ... we reach the conclusion that any appeal to God in this connection either adds to nothing at all, or it adds the wrong sort of thing.\"\n\nSocrates' \"Euthyphro dilemma\" is often considered one of the earliest refutations of the idea that morality requires religion. This line of reasoning is described by Peter Singer:\n\nGreg Epstein, a Humanist chaplain at Harvard University, dismisses the question of whether God is needed to be good \"because that question does not need to be answered—it needs to be rejected outright,\" adding, \"To suggest that one \"can't\" be good without belief in God is not just an opinion ... it is a prejudice. It may even be discrimination.\" This is in line with the \"Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics\" which states that religion and morality \"are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides.\" Others share this view. Singer states that morality \"is not something intelligible only in the context of religion\". Atheistic philosopher Julian Baggini stated that \"there is nothing to stop atheists believing in morality, a meaning for life, or human goodness. Atheism is only intrinsically negative when it comes to belief about God. It is as capable of a positive view of other aspects of life as any other belief.\" He also states that \"Morality is more than possible without God, it is entirely independent of him. That means atheists are not only more than capable of leading moral lives, they may even be able to lead more moral lives than religious believers who confuse divine law and punishment with right and wrong.\n\nPopular atheist author and \"Vanity Fair\" writer Christopher Hitchens remarked on the program \"Uncommon Knowledge\":\nPhilosopher Daniel Dennett says that secular organizations need to learn more 'marketing' lessons from religion—and from effective secular organizations like the TED conferences. This is partly because Dennett says that the idea that people need God to be morally good is an extremely harmful, yet popular myth. He believes it is a falsehood that persists because churches are currently much better at organizing people to do morally good work. In Dennett's words: \nPopular atheist author and biologist Richard Dawkins, writing in \"The God Delusion\", has stated that religious people have committed a wide variety of acts and held certain beliefs through history that are considered today to be morally repugnant. He has stated that Adolf Hitler and the Nazis held broadly Christian religious beliefs that inspired the Holocaust on account of antisemitic Christian doctrine, that Christians have traditionally imposed unfair restrictions on the legal and civil rights of women, and that Christians have condoned slavery of some form or description throughout most of Christianity's history. Dawkins insists that, since Jewish and Christian interpretations of the Bible have changed over the span of history so that what was formerly seen as permissible is now seen as impermissible, it is intellectually dishonest for them to believe theism provides an absolute moral foundation apart from secular intuition. In addition, he argued that since Christians and other religious groups do not acknowledge the binding authority of all parts of their holy texts (e.g., The books of Exodus and Leviticus state that those who work on the Sabbath and those caught performing acts of homosexuality, respectively, were to be put to death.), they are already capable of distinguishing \"right\" from \"wrong.\"\n\nThe well-known passage from Dostoyevsky's \"The Brothers Karamazov\", \"If God is dead, all is permitted,\" suggests that non-believers would not hold moral lives without the possibility of punishment by a God. Greg M. Epstein notes a similar theme in reverse. Famous apologies by Christians who have \"sinned\" (such as Bill Clinton and Jimmy Swaggart) \"must embolden some who take enormous risks for the thrill of a little immoral behavior: their Lord will forgive them, if they only ask nicely enough when—or if—they are eventually caught. If you're going to do something naughty, you're going to do it, and all the theology in the world isn't going to stop you.\" Some survey and sociological literature suggests that theists do no better than their secular counterparts in the percentage adhering to widely held moral standards (e.g., lying, theft and sexual infidelity).\n\nSome non-religious nihilistic and existentialist thinkers have affirmed the prominent theistic position that the existence of the personal God of theism is linked to the existence of an objective moral standard, asserting that questions of right and wrong inherently have no meaning and, thus, any notions of morality are nothing but an anthropogenic fantasy. Agnostic author and Absurdist philosopher Albert Camus discussed the issue of what he saw as the universe's indifference towards humankind and the meaninglessness of life in his prominent novel \"The Stranger\", in which the protagonist accepts death via execution without sadness or feelings of injustice. In his philosophical work, \"The Myth of Sisyphus\", Camus argues that human beings must choose to live defiantly in spite of their longing for purpose or direction and the apparent lack of evidence for God or moral imperatives. The atheistic existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre proposed that the individual must create his own essence and therefore must freely and independently create his own subjective moral standards by which to live.\n\nCases can also be seen in nature of animals exhibiting behavior we might classify as \"moral\" without religious directives to guide them. These include \"detailed studies of the complex systems of altruism and cooperation that operate among social insects\" and \"the posting of altruistic sentinels by some species of bird and mammal, who risk their own lives to warn the rest of the group of imminent danger.\"\n\nGreg Epstein states that \"sociologists have recently begun to pay more attention to the fact that some of the world's most secular countries, such as those in Scandinavia, are among the least violent, best educated, and most likely to care for the poor\". He adds that, \"scientists are beginning to document, though religion may have benefits for the brain, so may secularism and Humanism.\"\n\nOn April 26, 2012, the results of a study which tested their subjects' pro-social sentiments were published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science journal in which non-religious people had higher scores showing that they were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people also had lower scores when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers. But, global research done by Gallup between 2006 and 2008 on people from 145 countries give the opposite results. According to research, adherents of all the major world religions who attended religious services in the past week got higher rates of generosity such as donating money, volunteering, and helping a stranger than do their coreligionists who did not attend services (non-attenders).For the people who were nonreligious, but said that they attended religious services in the past week exhibited more generous behaviors than those who did not. Another global study by Gallup showed that highly religious people are more likely to help others in terms of donating money, volunteering, and helping strangers despite of having, on average, lower incomes than those who are less religious or nonreligious who reported higher incomes. In the research, it is said that cannot conclusively attribute these helping behaviors to the direct influence of religiosity, but that it is intuitive that religious people are more likely to engage in helping behaviors because values promoted by religions such as selflessness and generosity.\n\nA number of studies have been conducted on the empirics of morality in various countries, and the overall relationship between faith and crime is unclear. A 2001 review of studies on this topic found \"The existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied, contested, and inconclusive, and currently no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime.\" Phil Zuckerman's 2008 book, \"Society without God\", notes that Denmark and Sweden, \"which are probably the least religious countries in the world, and possibly in the history of the world\", enjoy \"among the lowest violent crime rates in the world [and] the lowest levels of corruption in the world\". Dozens of studies have been conducted on this topic since the twentieth century. A 2005 study by Gregory S. Paul published in the \"Journal of Religion and Society\" stated that, \"In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies,\" and \"In all secular developing democracies a centuries long-term trend has seen homicide rates drop to historical lows\" with the exceptions being the United States (with a high religiosity level) and \"theistic\" Portugal. In a response, Gary Jensen builds on and refines Paul's study. His conclusion is that a \"complex relationship\" exists between religiosity and homicide \"with some\ndimensions of religiosity encouraging homicide and other dimensions discouraging it\".\n\n\n"}

Stabbing differs from slashing or cutting in that the motion of the object used in a stabbing generally moves perpendicular to and directly into the victim's body, rather than being drawn across it.\n\nStabbings today are common among gangs and in prisons because knives are cheap, easy to acquire (or manufacture), easily concealable and relatively effective. In 2013 about 8 million stabbings occurred.\n\nStabbings have been common throughout human history and were the means used to assassinate a number of distinguished historical figures, such as Second Caliph Umar and Roman emperors Julius Caesar and Caligula.\n\nIn Japan, the historical practice of stabbing oneself deliberately in ritual suicide is known as \"seppuku\" (more colloquially \"hara-kiri\", literally \"belly-cutting\" since it involves cutting open the abdomen). The ritual is highly codified, and the person committing suicide is assisted by a \"second\" who is entrusted to decapitate him cleanly (and thus expedite death and prevent an undignified spectacle) once he has made the abdominal wound.\n\nThe human skin has a somewhat elastic property as a self-defense; when the human body is stabbed by a thin object such as a small kitchen knife, the skin often closes tightly around the object and closes again if the object is removed, which can trap some blood within the body. It has thus been speculated that the fuller, an elongated concave depression in a metal blade, functions to let blood out of the body in order to cause more damage. This misconception has led to fullers becoming widely known as \"blood grooves\". The fuller is actually a structural reinforcement of the blade similar in design to a metal I-beam used in construction. However, internal bleeding is just as dangerous as external bleeding; if enough blood vessels are severed to cause serious injury, the skin's elasticity will do nothing to prevent blood from exiting the circulatory system and accumulating uselessly in other parts of the body.\n\nDeath from stabbing is caused by shock, severe blood loss, infection, or loss of function of an essential organ such as the heart and/or lungs.\n\nAlthough previously a victim of abdominal stabbing would be subject to exploratory surgery laparotomy, it is now considered safe not to operate if the patient is stable. In that case, they should be observed for signs of decompensation indicating a serious injury. In the event that the patient initially presents stabbing injuries and is unstable, laparotomy should be initiated to discover and rectify any internal injury.\n\nWhen someone who has sustained a stab wound dies, the body is autopsied and the wound is inspected by a forensic pathologist. Such examination can yield valuable information about the weapon used to produce the injury. From the external appearance and internal findings, the pathologist will usually be able to offer opinion about the dimensions of the weapon including the width and minimum possible length of the blade. It is possible to determine whether the weapon was single edged or double edged.\n\nSometimes factors like the taper of the blade and movement of knife in the wound can also be determined. Bruises or abrasions may give information about the guard.\n\n"}

Certain systems remain hazardous for a considerable period after their useful life, and will usually be managed to ensure that the public and the environment is not exposed to the hazard. It is incumbent on the systems designer to consider the outcome should this stewardship be discontinued for any reason, and to design a system which is as robust as possible in the event of stewardship cessation.\n\nThe most obvious example is the nuclear industry, and the radioactive waste it generates which will be a hazard for many centuries. In the present era, most high level waste is in still in currently managed facilities, but various methods are being considered for disposal. Most of the proposed disposal methods are designed to put the waste in a place so isolated from the environment that (it is hoped) immediate stewardship cessation would be safe and appropriate. However, many people are more comfortable with systems where the waste is still accessible, so that if there is an unforeseen problem with the disposal method, the waste can still be accessed to rectify the problem. These systems will still require some level of stewardship, but the system designer must consider that this may not be available for the hundreds of years required.\n\nAnother example is when geostationary communications satellites reach the end of their useful lives. Stewardship cessation will occur hopefully in a planned manner, where the operator will move the satellite to a somewhat higher orbit to minimise the risk that the satellite will be a collision hazard to other satellites in the geostationary arc (graveyard burn). Unplanned stewardship cessation will occur if telecommand access to the satellite's systems is cut off due to a failure, for instance in the telecommand receivers.\n\nReasons for stewardship cessation include:\n\n"}

It was subsequently supported by many prominent Russian human rights organisations including the Moscow Helsinki Group, the Memorial human rights centre and other public and political movements and associations. It started with modest support but with each event increased in the numbers.\n\nEvery one of the Strategy-31 actions since it commenced has been refused permission by the authorities on the grounds that other activities were planned to take place on Triumfalnaya Square at the same time on the respective dates.

{"id": "745789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=745789", "title": "Subadditivity", "text": "Subadditivity\n\nIn mathematics, subadditivity is a property of a function that states, roughly, that evaluating the function for the sum of two elements of the domain always returns something less than or equal to the sum of the function's values at each element. There are numerous examples of subadditive functions in various areas of mathematics, particularly norms and square roots. Additive maps are special cases of subadditive functions.\n\nA subadditive function is a function formula_1, having a domain \"A\" and an ordered codomain \"B\" that are both closed under addition, with the following property:\n\nAn example is the square root function, having the non-negative real numbers as domain and codomain,\nsince formula_3 we have:\n\nA sequence formula_5, is called subadditive if it satisfies the inequality\nfor all \"m\" and \"n\". This is a special case of subadditive function, if a sequence is interpreted as a function on the set of natural numbers.\n\nA useful result pertaining to subadditive sequences is the following lemma due to Michael Fekete.\n\nThe analogue of Fekete's lemma holds for superadditive sequences as well, that is:\nformula_11 (The limit then may be positive infinity: consider the sequence formula_12.)\n\nThere are extensions of Fekete's lemma that do not require the inequality (1) to hold for all \"m\" and \"n\", but only for \"m\" and \"n\" such that formula_13 Moreover, the condition formula_14 may be weakened as follows: formula_15 provided that formula_16 is an increasing function such that the integral formula_17 converges (near the infinity).\n\nThere are also results that allow one to deduce the rate of convergence to the limit whose existence is stated in Fekete's lemma if some kind of both superadditivity and subadditivity is present.\n\nBesides, analogues of Fekete's lemma have been proved for subadditive real maps (with additional assumptions) from finite subsets of an amenable group \nand further, of a cancellative left-amenable semigroup.\n\nIf \"f\" is a subadditive function, and if 0 is in its domain, then \"f\"(0) ≥ 0. To see this, take the inequality at the top. formula_22. Hence formula_23\n\nA concave function formula_24 with formula_25 is also subadditive.\nTo see this, one first observes that formula_26.\nThen looking at the sum of this bound for formula_27 and formula_28, will finally verify that \"f\" is subadditive.\n\nThe negative of a subadditive function is superadditive.\n\nSubadditivity is an essential property of some particular cost functions. It is, generally, a necessary and sufficient condition for the verification of a natural monopoly. It implies that production from only one firm is socially less expensive (in terms of average costs) than production of a fraction of the original quantity by an equal number of firms.\n\nEconomies of scale are represented by subadditive average cost functions.\n\nExcept in the case of complementary goods, the price of goods (as a function of quantity) must be subadditive. Otherwise, if the sum of the cost of two items is cheaper than the cost of the bundle of two of them together, then nobody would ever buy the bundle, effectively causing the price of the bundle to \"become\" the sum of the prices of the two separate items. Thus proving that it is not a sufficient condition for a natural monopoly; since the unit of exchange may not be the actual cost of an item. This situation is familiar to everyone in the political arena where some minority asserts that the loss of some particular freedom at some particular level of government means that many governments are better; whereas the majority assert that there is some other correct unit of cost.\n\nSubadditivity occurs in the thermodynamic properties of non-ideal solutions and mixtures like the excess molar volume and heat of mixing or excess enthalpy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2113608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2113608", "title": "Supercontinent cycle", "text": "Supercontinent cycle\n\nThe supercontinent cycle is the quasi-periodic aggregation and dispersal of Earth's continental crust. There are varying opinions as to whether the amount of continental crust is increasing, decreasing, or staying about the same, but it is agreed that the Earth's crust is constantly being reconfigured. One complete supercontinent cycle is said to take 300 to 500 million years. Continental collision makes fewer and larger continents while rifting makes more and smaller continents.\n\nThe most recent supercontinent, Pangaea, formed about 300 million years ago (0.3 Ga). There are two different views on the history of earlier supercontinents. The first proposes a series of supercontinents: Vaalbara ( 3.6 to c. 2.8 billion years ago); Ur ( 3 billion years ago); Kenorland ( 2.7 to 2.1 billion years ago); Columbia ( 1.8 to 1.5 billion years ago); Rodinia ( 1.25 billion to 750 million years ago); and Pannotia ( 600 million years ago), whose dispersal produced the fragments that ultimately collided to form Pangaea.\n\nThe second view (Protopangea-Paleopangea), based on both palaeomagnetic and geological evidence, is that supercontinent cycles did not occur before about 0.6 Ga (during the Ediacaran Period). Instead, the continental crust comprised a single supercontinent from about 2.7 Ga (Gigaannum, or \"billion years ago\") until it broke up for the first time, somewhere around 0.6 Ga. This reconstruction is based on the observation that if only small peripheral modifications are made to the primary reconstruction, the data show that the palaeomagnetic poles converged to quasi-static positions for long intervals between about 2.7–2.2, 1.5–1.25 and 0.75–0.6 Ga. During the intervening periods, the poles appear to have conformed to a unified apparent polar wander path. Thus the paleomagnetic data are adequately explained by the existence of a single Protopangea–Paleopangea supercontinent with prolonged quasi-integrity. The prolonged duration of this supercontinent could be explained by the operation of lid tectonics (comparable to the tectonics operating on Mars and Venus) during Precambrian times, as opposed to the plate tectonics seen on the contemporary Earth.\nThe kinds of minerals found inside ancient diamonds suggest that the cycle of supercontinental formation and breakup began roughly 3.0 billion years ago (3.0 Ga). Before 3.2 billion years ago only diamonds with peridotitic compositions (commonly found in the Earth's mantle) formed, whereas after 3.0 billion years ago eclogitic diamonds (rocks from the Earth's surface crust) became prevalent. This change is thought to have come about as subduction and continental collision introduced eclogite into subcontinental diamond-forming fluids.\nThe hypothesized supercontinent cycle is overlaid by the Wilson cycle named after plate tectonics pioneer J. Tuzo Wilson, which describes the periodic opening and closing of ocean basins from a single plate rift. The oldest seafloor material found today dates to only 170 million years old, whereas the oldest continental crust material found today dates to 4 billion years, showing the relative brevity of the regional Wilson cycles compared to the planetary pulse seen in the arrangement of the continents.\n\nIt is known that sea level is generally low when the continents are together and high when they are apart. For example, sea level was low at the time of formation of Pangaea (Permian) and Pannotia (latest Neoproterozoic), and rose rapidly to maxima during Ordovician and Cretaceous times, when the continents were dispersed. This is because the age of the oceanic lithosphere provides a major control on the depth of the ocean basins, and therefore on global sea level. Oceanic lithosphere forms at mid-ocean ridges and moves outwards, conductively cooling and shrinking, which decreases the thickness and increases the density of the oceanic lithosphere, and lowers the seafloor away from mid-ocean ridges. For oceanic lithosphere that is less than about 75 million years old, a simple cooling half-space model of conductive cooling works, in which the depth of the ocean basins \"d\" in areas in which there is no nearby subduction is a function of the age of the oceanic lithosphere \"t\". In general,\n\nwhere \"κ\" is the thermal diffusivity of the mantle lithosphere ( ), \"a\" is the effective thermal expansion coefficient for rock ( ), \"T\" is the temperature of ascending magma compared to the temperature at the upper boundary ( 1220 °C for the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, 1120 °C for the eastern Pacific) and \"d\" is the depth of the ridge below the ocean surface. After plugging in rough numbers for the sea floor, the equation becomes:\n\nwhere \"d\" is in meters and \"t\" is in millions of years, so that just-formed crust at the mid-ocean ridges lies at about 2,500 m depth, whereas 50-million-year-old seafloor lies at a depth of about 5,000 m.\n\nAs the mean level of the sea floor decreases, the volume of the ocean basins increases, and if other factors that can control sea level remain constant, sea level falls. The converse is also true: younger oceanic lithosphere leads to shallower oceans and higher sea levels if other factors remain constant.\n\nArea \"A\", of the oceans, can change when continents rift (stretching the continents decreases A and raises sea level) or as a result of continental collision (compressing the continents leads to an increase \"A\" and lowers sea level). Increasing sea level will flood the continents, while decreasing sea level will expose continental shelves.\n\nBecause the continental shelf has a very low slope, a small increase in sea level will result in a large change in the percent of continents flooded.\n\nIf the world ocean on average is young, the seafloor will be relatively shallow, and sea level will be high: more of the continents are flooded. If the world ocean is on average old, seafloor will be relatively deep, and sea level will be low: more of the continents will be exposed.\n\nThere is thus a relatively simple relationship between the supercontinent cycle and the mean age of the seafloor.\n\nThere will also be a climatic effect of the supercontinent cycle that will amplify this further:\n\nThere is a progression of tectonic regimes that accompany the supercontinent cycle:\n\nDuring break-up of the supercontinent, rifting environments dominate. This is followed by passive margin environments, while seafloor spreading continues and the oceans grow. This in turn is followed by the development of collisional environments that become increasingly important with time. First collisions are between continents and island arcs, but lead ultimately to continent-continent collisions. This is the situation that was observed during the Paleozoic supercontinent cycle and is being observed for the Mesozoic–Cenozoic supercontinent cycle, still in progress.\n\nThere are two types of global earth climates: icehouse and greenhouse. Icehouse is characterized by frequent continental glaciations and severe desert environments. Greenhouse is characterized by warm climates. Both reflect the supercontinent cycle. It is now a short greenhouse phase of an icehouse world.\n\nPeriods of icehouse climate: much of Neoproterozoic, late Paleozoic, late Cenozoic.\n\nPeriods of greenhouse climate: Early Paleozoic, Mesozoic–early Cenozoic.\n\nThe principal mechanism for evolution is natural selection among diverse populations. As genetic drift occurs more frequently in small populations, diversity is an observed consequence of isolation. Less isolation, and thus less diversification, occurs when the continents are all together, producing both one continent and one ocean with one coast. In Latest Neoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic times, when the tremendous proliferation of diverse metazoa occurred, isolation of marine environments resulted from the breakup of Pannotia.\n\nA north–south arrangement of continents and oceans leads to much more diversity and isolation than east–west arrangements. North-to-south arrangements give climatically different zones along the communication routes to the north and south, which are separated by water or land from other continental or oceanic zones of similar climate. Formation of similar tracts of continents and ocean basins oriented east–west would lead to much less isolation, diversification, and slower evolution, since each continent or ocean is in fewer climatic zones. Through the Cenozoic, isolation has been maximized by a north–south arrangement.\n\nDiversity, as measured by the number of families, follows the supercontinent cycle very well.\n\n\n"}

This yield usually varies over time with the needs of the ecosystem to maintain itself, e.g. a forest that has recently suffered a blight or flooding or fire will require more of its own ecological yield to sustain and re-establish a mature forest. While doing so, the sustainable yield may be much less.\n\nIn forestry terms it is the largest amount of harvest activity that can occur without degrading the productivity of the stock.\n\nThis concept is important in fishery management, in which sustainable yield is defined as the number of fish that can be extracted without reducing the base of fish stock, and the maximum sustainable yield is defined as the amount of fish that can be extracted under given environmental conditions. In fisheries, the basic natural capital or virgin population, must decrease with extraction. At the same time productivity increases. Hence, sustainable yield would be within the range in which the natural capital together with its production are able to provide satisfactory yield. It may be very difficult to quantify sustainable yield, because every dynamic ecological conditions and other factors not related to harvesting induce changes and fluctuations in both, the natural capital and its productivity.\n\nIn the case of groundwater there is a safe yield of water extraction per unit time, beyond which the aquifer risks the state of overdrafting or even depletion.\n\n"}

{"id": "25512250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25512250", "title": "Truth table", "text": "Truth table\n\nA truth table is a mathematical table used in logic—specifically in connection with Boolean algebra, boolean functions, and propositional calculus—which sets out the functional values of logical expressions on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each combination of values taken by their logical variables (Enderton, 2001). In particular, truth tables can be used to show whether a propositional expression is true for all legitimate input values, that is, logically valid.\n\nA truth table has one column for each input variable (for example, P and Q), and one final column showing all of the possible results of the logical operation that the table represents (for example, P XOR Q). Each row of the truth table contains one possible configuration of the input variables (for instance, P=true Q=false), and the result of the operation for those values. See the examples below for further clarification. Ludwig Wittgenstein is often credited with inventing the truth table in his \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\", though it appeared at least a year earlier in a paper on propositional logic by Emil Leon Post.\n\nThere are 4 unary operations:\n\nThe output value is always true, regardless of the input value of p\n\nThe output value is never true: that is, always false, regardless of the input value of p\nLogical identity is an operation on one logical value p, for which the output value remains p.\n\nThe truth table for the logical identity operator is as follows:\n\nLogical negation is an operation on one logical value, typically the value of a proposition, that produces a value of \"true\" if its operand is false and a value of \"false\" if its operand is true.\n\nThe truth table for NOT p (also written as ¬p, Np, Fpq, or ~p) is as follows:\n\nThere are 16 possible truth functions of two binary variables:\n\nHere is an extended truth table giving definitions of all possible truth functions of two Boolean variables P and Q:\n\nwhere\n\nThe four combinations of input values for p, q, are read by row from the table above.\nThe output function for each p, q combination, can be read, by row, from the table.\n\nKey:\n\nThe following table is oriented by column, rather than by row. There are four columns rather than four rows, to display the four combinations of p, q, as input. \n\np: T T F F<br>\nq: T F T F\n\nThere are 16 rows in this key, one row for each binary function of the two binary variables, p, q. For example, in row 2 of this Key, the value of Converse nonimplication ('formula_1') is solely T, for the column denoted by the unique combination p=F, q=T; while in row 2, the value of that 'formula_1' operation is F for the three remaining columns of p, q. The output row for formula_1 is thus\n\n2: F F T F\n\nand the 16-row key is\n\nLogical operators can also be visualized using Venn diagrams.\n\nLogical conjunction is an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces a value of \"true\" if both of its operands are true.\n\nThe truth table for p AND q (also written as p ∧ q, Kpq, p & q, or p formula_4 q) is as follows:\n\nIn ordinary language terms, if both \"p\" and \"q\" are true, then the conjunction \"p\" ∧ \"q\" is true. For all other assignments of logical values to \"p\" and to \"q\" the conjunction \"p\" ∧ \"q\" is false.\n\nIt can also be said that if \"p\", then \"p\" ∧ \"q\" is \"q\", otherwise \"p\" ∧ \"q\" is \"p\".\n\nLogical disjunction is an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces a value of \"true\" if at least one of its operands is true.\n\nThe truth table for p OR q (also written as p ∨ q, Apq, p || q, or p + q) is as follows:\n\nStated in English, if \"p\", then \"p\" ∨ \"q\" is \"p\", otherwise \"p\" ∨ \"q\" is \"q\".\n\nLogical implication and the material conditional are both associated with an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, which produces a value of \"false\" if the first operand is true and the second operand is false, and a value of \"true\" otherwise.\n\nThe truth table associated with the logical implication p implies q (symbolized as p ⇒ q, or more rarely Cpq) is as follows:\n\nThe truth table associated with the material conditional if p then q (symbolized as p → q) is as follows:\n\nIt may also be useful to note that p ⇒ q and p → q are equivalent to ¬p ∨ q.\n\nLogical equality (also known as biconditional) is an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces a value of \"true\" if both operands are false or both operands are true.\n\nThe truth table for p XNOR q (also written as p ↔ q, Epq, p = q, or p ≡ q) is as follows:\n\nSo p EQ q is true if p and q have the same truth value (both true or both false), and false if they have different truth values.\n\nExclusive disjunction is an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces a value of \"true\" if one but not both of its operands is true.\n\nThe truth table for p XOR q (also written as p ⊕ q, Jpq, p ≠ q, or p ↮ q) is as follows:\n\nFor two propositions, XOR can also be written as (p ∧ ¬q) ∨ (¬p ∧ q).\n\nThe logical NAND is an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces a value of \"false\" if both of its operands are true. In other words, it produces a value of \"true\" if at least one of its operands is false.\n\nThe truth table for p NAND q (also written as p ↑ q, Dpq, or p | q) is as follows:\n\nIt is frequently useful to express a logical operation as a compound operation, that is, as an operation that is built up or composed from other operations. Many such compositions are possible, depending on the operations that are taken as basic or \"primitive\" and the operations that are taken as composite or \"derivative\".\n\nIn the case of logical NAND, it is clearly expressible as a compound of NOT and AND.\n\nThe negation of a conjunction: ¬(\"p\" ∧ \"q\"), and the disjunction of negations: (¬\"p\") ∨ (¬\"q\") can be tabulated as follows:\n\nThe logical NOR is an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces a value of \"true\" if both of its operands are false. In other words, it produces a value of \"false\" if at least one of its operands is true. ↓ is also known as the Peirce arrow after its inventor, Charles Sanders Peirce, and is a Sole sufficient operator.\n\nThe truth table for p NOR q (also written as p ↓ q, or Xpq) is as follows:\n\nThe negation of a disjunction ¬(\"p\" ∨ \"q\"), and the conjunction of negations (¬\"p\") ∧ (¬\"q\") can be tabulated as follows:\n\nInspection of the tabular derivations for NAND and NOR, under each assignment of logical values to the functional arguments \"p\" and \"q\", produces the identical patterns of functional values for ¬(\"p\" ∧ \"q\") as for (¬\"p\") ∨ (¬\"q\"), and for ¬(\"p\" ∨ \"q\") as for (¬\"p\") ∧ (¬\"q\"). Thus the first and second expressions in each pair are logically equivalent, and may be substituted for each other in all contexts that pertain solely to their logical values.\n\nThis equivalence is one of De Morgan's laws.\n\nTruth tables can be used to prove many other logical equivalences. For example, consider the following truth table:\n\nThis demonstrates the fact that formula_5 is logically equivalent to formula_6.\n\nHere is a truth table that gives definitions of the 6 most commonly used out of the 16 possible truth functions of two Boolean variables P and Q:\n\nwhere\n\nFor binary operators, a condensed form of truth table is also used, where the row headings and the column headings specify the operands and the table cells specify the result. For example, Boolean logic uses this condensed truth table notation:\n\nThis notation is useful especially if the operations are commutative, although one can additionally specify that the rows are the first operand and the columns are the second operand. This condensed notation is particularly useful in discussing multi-valued extensions of logic, as it significantly cuts down on combinatoric explosion of the number of rows otherwise needed. It also provides for quickly recognizable characteristic \"shape\" of the distribution of the values in the table which can assist the reader in grasping the rules more quickly.\n\nTruth tables are also used to specify the function of hardware look-up tables (LUTs) in digital logic circuitry. For an n-input LUT, the truth table will have 2^\"n\" values (or rows in the above tabular format), completely specifying a boolean function for the LUT. By representing each boolean value as a bit in a binary number, truth table values can be efficiently encoded as integer values in electronic design automation (EDA) software. For example, a 32-bit integer can encode the truth table for a LUT with up to 5 inputs.\n\nWhen using an integer representation of a truth table, the output value of the LUT can be obtained by calculating a bit index \"k\" based on the input values of the LUT, in which case the LUT's output value is the \"k\"th bit of the integer. For example, to evaluate the output value of a LUT given an array of \"n\" boolean input values, the bit index of the truth table's output value can be computed as follows: if the \"i\"th input is true, let formula_14, else let formula_15. Then the \"k\"th bit of the binary representation of the truth table is the LUT's output value, where formula_16.\n\nTruth tables are a simple and straightforward way to encode boolean functions, however given the exponential growth in size as the number of inputs increase, they are not suitable for functions with a large number of inputs. Other representations which are more memory efficient are text equations and binary decision diagrams.\n\nIn digital electronics and computer science (fields of applied logic engineering and mathematics), truth tables can be used to reduce basic boolean operations to simple correlations of inputs to outputs, without the use of logic gates or code. For example, a binary addition can be represented with the truth table:\n\nThis truth table is read left to right:\n\nNote that this table does not describe the logic operations necessary to implement this operation, rather it simply specifies the function of inputs to output values.\n\nWith respect to the result, this example may be arithmetically viewed as modulo 2 binary addition, and as logically equivalent to the exclusive-or (exclusive disjunction) binary logic operation.\n\nIn this case it can be used for only very simple inputs and outputs, such as 1s and 0s. However, if the number of types of values one can have on the inputs increases, the size of the truth table will increase.\n\nFor instance, in an addition operation, one needs two operands, A and B. Each can have one of two values, zero or one. The number of combinations of these two values is 2×2, or four. So the result is four possible outputs of C and R. If one were to use base 3, the size would increase to 3×3, or nine possible outputs.\n\nThe first \"addition\" example above is called a half-adder. A full-adder is when the carry from the previous operation is provided as input to the next adder. Thus, a truth table of eight rows would be needed to describe a full adder's logic:\n\nIrving Anellis has done the research to show that C.S. Peirce appears to be the earliest logician (in 1893) to devise a truth table matrix. From the summary of his paper:\n\n\n"}

Subsequently, from 1945 to 1975 various female officials within the United Nations and leaders of women's movements on the global stage attempted to turn these principles into action. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution (resolution 3010) that 1975 should be International Women's Year. In December 1975, the UN General Assembly passed a further resolution (resolution 31/136) that 1976–1985 should be the \"Decade of Women\".\n\nIn conjunction with International Women's Year, the first world conference on women was held in Mexico City in 1975. It resulted in the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace.\n\nThe second world conference on women was held in Copenhagen in 1980. The conference agreed that the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was an important milestone. The Copenhagen conference also acknowledged the gap between rights being secured for women and women's ability to exercise those rights. It was also agreed that it was action on the three areas of: equal access to education; employment opportunities; and adequate health care services are essential to achieve the goals set out in Mexico.\n\nThe third world conference on women was held in Nairobi in 1985. The Nairobi conference set out areas by which progress in women's equality could be measured: constitutional and legal measures; equality in social participation; equality in political participation; and decision-making. The conference also acknowledged that women need to participate in all areas of human activity, not just those areas that relate to gender.\n\nDelegates had prepared a Declaration and Platform for Action aimed at achieving greater equality and opportunity for women.\n\nIn fallout from pre-conference meetings, the Holy See publicly disagreed with positions outlined by the United States and other nations concerning abortion, reproductive rights, and other sensitive issues.\n\nGertrude Mongella of Tanzania was the secretary-general of the conference.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi delivered the keynote address at the conference.\n\nHillary Clinton, at the time the First Lady of the United States, gave the speech \"Women's Rights Are Human Rights\" at the conference on 5 September 1995. That speech is considered to be influential in the women's rights movement, and in 2013 Clinton led a review of how women's rights have changed since her 1995 speech. The 1995 speech was listed as No. 35 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).\n\nSaint Teresa of Calcutta, MC (26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997) more commonly known as Mother Teresa, gave a speech at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. Teresa stated \"Yet we can destroy this gift of motherhood, especially by the evil of abortion, but also by thinking that other things like jobs or positions are more important than loving.\"\n\nMany other speeches were also given at the conference, on behalf of governments, the United Nations and inter-governmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations.\n\nBeverly Palesa Ditsie is the first african lesbian woman to make a statement arguing for the rights of LGBT, espesially lesbians on the 13th of december 1995. to address the United Nations about LGBT rights.\n\nA summary of the Beijing Platform for Action is given below:\n\nA major result of the conference was the Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women, signed at the NGO Forum in the Indigenous Women's Tent. This document seeks, in part, to reconcile the tension felt by Aboriginal women activists between (primarily white) feminism and Aboriginal movements dominated by men. It was a significant step forward towards Indigenous women's rights and a significant victory for Indigenous feminism practice.\n\nThe 50-point declaration provides rationale and a clear call to action for governments navigating Aboriginal issues across the globe. The demands in the document are \"that all governments and international non-governmental and governmental organizations recognize the right of Indigenous peoples to self-determination, and enshrine the historical, political, social, cultural, economic, and religious rights of the Indigenous peoples in their constitutions and legal systems.\" From that premise, the declaration goes on to specify areas for action including self-determination; development, education and health; human rights violations and violence against Indigenous women; intellectual and cultural heritage; and political participation.\n\nThe document addresses the unique problems Aboriginal women suffer in addition to those suffered by Aboriginal men, which include erosion of culture (and gender roles therein), loss of traditional land, and compromised identity and status in the spaces they inhabit.\n\nAs its bases, the declaration cites the \"UN Declaration of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous peoples, the Draft Declaration of the Rights of the Indigenous peoples, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women, Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, and the Copenhagen Social Summit Declaration.\"\n\nIn 2014 UN Women began its commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women with the \"Empowering Women, Empowering Humanity: Picture It!\" campaign, also called the Beijing+20 campaign.\n\nIn 2015 a documentary called \"MAKERS: Once And For All\", about the Fourth World Conference on Women, premiered.\n"}
