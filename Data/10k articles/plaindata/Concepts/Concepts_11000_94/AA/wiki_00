Translated as \"act of being\", the expression \"actus essendi\" refers to a fundamental metaphysical principle discovered by Aquinas in his Christianizing of Aristotle. \n\nAquinas saw that in any subsisting extramental thing one finds a couplet of metaphysical principles: one is the ‘essence’ which makes the thing to be what it is, the other is the \"actus essendi\" which gives to the thing and to its ‘essence’ actual existence. \n\nThe observation that individual things display instantiations of a particular ‘essence’ led Aquinas to postulate that what gives actual existence to a thing and to its ‘essence’ — the \"actus essendi\" — is unique, in the sense that the perfection of \"actus essendi\" cannot be said to be common in the way an ‘essence’ is said to be common. \n\nThings instantiating the essence of horseness, for example, are said to be similar because of their horseness. The essence of horseness is what makes horses to be the same under a common category.\n\nBut things instantiating the perfection of \"actus essendi\", are said to be different on account of their \"actus essendi\". The possession of \"actus essendi\" is what makes things unique and distinct from all other things. \n\nThus in what actually exists as a subsisting extramental thing, there is an ‘essence’ which makes the thing to be what it is (a horse, for example), and the \"actus essendi\" which makes the thing to be a real, individual, existing thing.\n\nAristotle didn’t have the notion of \"actus essendi\". In fact, the contribution of Aquinas to the philosophy of being is precisely this, that he discovered that all Aristotelian acts were in reality ‘potency’ with respect to the \"actus essendi\". \n\nAquinas saw that the metaphysical principle of \"actus essendi\" is the \"act of all acts, the perfection of all perfections\", and \"a proper effect of God\". The metaphysics of Aristotle did not reach that far.\n\nAccordingly, Pope John Paul II stresses in his teachings that the philosophy of Aquinas is the philosophy of \"actus essendi\", \"whose transcendental value paves the most direct way to rise to the knowledge of subsisting Being and pure Act, namely to God.\" Aquinas defined God as the ‘\"Ipse Actus Essendi subsistens\"’, subsisting act of being.\n\n"}
{"id": "716672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=716672", "title": "Agency (philosophy)", "text": "Agency (philosophy)\n\nAgency is the capacity of an actor to act in a given environment. The capacity to act does not at first imply a specific moral dimension to the ability to make the choice to act, and moral agency is therefore a distinct concept. In sociology, an agent is an individual engaging with the social structure. Notably, though, the primacy of social structure vs. individual capacity with regard to persons' actions is debated within sociology. This debate concerns, at least partly, the level of reflexivity an agent may possess.\n\nAgency may either be classified as unconscious, involuntary behavior, or purposeful, goal directed activity (intentional action). An agent typically has some sort of immediate awareness of their physical activity and the goals that the activity is aimed at realizing. In ‘goal directed action’ an agent implements a kind of direct control or guidance over their own behavior.\n\nAgency is contrasted to objects reacting to natural forces involving only unthinking deterministic processes. In this respect, agency is subtly distinct from the concept of free will, the philosophical doctrine that our choices are not the product of causal chains, but are significantly free or undetermined. Human agency entails the claim that humans do in fact make decisions and enact them on the world. \"How\" humans come to make decisions, by free choice or other processes, is another issue.\n\nThe capacity of a human to act as an agent is personal to that human, though considerations of the outcomes flowing from particular acts of human agency for us and others can then be thought to invest a moral component into a given situation wherein an agent has acted, and thus to involve moral agency. If a situation is the consequence of human decision making, persons may be under a duty to apply value judgments to the consequences of their decisions, and held to be responsible for those decisions. Human agency entitles the observer to ask \"should this have occurred?\" in a way that would be nonsensical in circumstances lacking human decisions-makers, for example, the impact of comet Shoemaker–Levy on Jupiter.\n\nThe philosophical discipline in charge of studying agency is action theory. In certain philosophical traditions (particularly those established by Hegel and Marx), human agency is a collective, historical dynamic, rather than a function arising out of individual behavior. Hegel's Geist and Marx's universal class are idealist and materialist expressions of this idea of humans treated as social beings, organized to act in concert. Also look at the debate, philosophically derived in part from the works of Hume, between determinism and indeterminacy.\n\nStructure and agency forms an enduring core debate in sociology. Essentially the same as in the Marxist conception, \"agency\" refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices, based on their will, whereas \"structure\" refers to those factors (such as social class, but also religion, gender, ethnicity, subculture, etc.) that seem to limit or influence the opportunities that individuals have.\n\nOther notions of agency have arisen in the field of economics/management, psychology and social cybernetics:\n\nIn economics (contract theory):\n\n\"Economic agency\" is an internal instrumentality through which external influences operate mechanistically on action. Internal agency events are a reflection of the impact of external environments from which causal attributes are ignored, and the self-system is simply a repository and conduit for environmental forces.\n\nIn psychology:\n\nThe term of agency used in different fields of psychology with different meaning. It can refer to the ability of recognizing agents or attributing agency to objects based on simple perceptual cues or principles, for instance the principle of rationality, which holds that context-sensitive, goal-directed efficient actions are the crucial characteristics of agents. This topic is thoroughly investigated by developmental and comparative psychologists to understand how an observer is able to differentiate agentive entities from inanimate objects, but it can be also related to the term of autonomous intelligent agency used in cybernetics. Agency can also imply the sense of agency, that is the feeling of being in control.\n\n\"Emergent interactive agency\" defines Bandura's view of agencies, where human agency can be exercised through direct personal agency. Bandura formulates his view of agency as a socio-cognitive one, where people are self-organizing, proactive, self-regulating, and engage in self-reflection, and are not just reactive organisms shaped and shepherded by external events. People have the power to influence their own actions to produce certain results. The capacity to exercise control over one’s thought processes, motivation, affect, and action operates through mechanisms of personal agency. Such agencies are emergent and interactive, apply perspectives of social cognition, and make causal contributions to its own motivations and actions using ‘reciprocal causation’.\n\nIn social cybernetics:\n\n\"Autonomous agency\" is able to embrace the concepts of both the economic agency and the emergent interactive agency. An autonomous system is self-directed, operating in, and being influenced by, interactive environments. It usually has its own immanent dynamics that impact on the way it interacts. It is also adaptable and (hence viable thus having a durable existence), proactive, self-organizing, self-regulating and so forth, participates in creating its own behaviour, and contributes to its life circumstances through cognitive and cultural functionality. Autonomous agency may also be concerned with the relationship between two or more agencies in a mutual relationship with each other and their environments, with imperatives for an agency's behaviour within an interactive context due to immanent emergent attributes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42349721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42349721", "title": "Aham Brahmasmi", "text": "Aham Brahmasmi\n\nIn Hindu philosophy, the Sanskrit aphorism Ahaṁ Brahmāsmi (Devanagari: अहं ब्रह्मास्मि) \"I am Brahman\" or \"I am the Infinite Reality\" or \"I am the Ultimate\". It is one of the four Mahavakyas used to explain the unity of macrocosm and microcosm.\n\nLiterally, \"Aham\" (अहं) means \"I\", that which cannot be deserted or abandoned on account of being constant, unavoidable, ever present. \"Brahma\" (ब्रह्म) means ever-full or whole (ब्रह्म is the first case ending singular of Brahman) and \"Asmi\" (अस्मि) means \"am,\" the first-person singular present tense of the verb \"अस्,\" \"to be.\" This \"mahāvākya\" is in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad of the Shukla Yajurveda.\n\nBrahman is the Infinite Reality, the all encompassing existence in itself; only when the ego dies can this be realized. In this aphorism the \"I\" is not the limited transmigrating ego, the doer and the enjoyer within, and also not the body and the mind. Man (who is a conscious entity) alone has the capacity to improve his present state, to guide his future, to enquire and know the truth, and to free himself from the cycle of birth and death (\"vidyā adhikāra\") through thoughtful actions (\"karma adhikāra\").\n\nVidyāranya in his Panchadasi (V.4) explains:\n\nThis realization is gained through true enquiry.\nVaishnavas, when they talk about Brahman, usually refer to impersonal Brahman, brahmajyoti (rays of Brahman). Brahman according to them means God - Narayana, Rama or Krishna. Thus, the meaning of \"aham brahma asmi\" according to their philosophy is that \"I am a drop of Ocean of Consciousness.\", or \"I am soul, part of cosmic spirit, Parabrahma\". Here, the term Parabrahma is introduced to avoid confusion. If Brahman can mean soul (though, Parabrahma is also the soul, but Supreme one - Paramatma), then Parabrahma should refer to God, Lord Vishnu.\n\nThis memorable expression appears in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad when the sage, in the context of meditation on the Self, in reply to the query – What did that Brahma know by which It became all? - states:-\n\nIn his comment on this passage Sankara explains that here Brahman is not the conditioned Brahman (saguna), that a transitory entity cannot be eternal, that knowledge about Brahman, the infinite all-pervading entity, has been enjoined, that knowledge of non-duality alone dispels ignorance and that the meditation based on resemblance is only an idea. He also tells us that the expression \"Aham Brahmaasmi\" is the explanation of the mantra –\n\nHe explains that non-duality and plurality are contradictory only when applied to the Self, which is eternal and without parts, but not to the effects, which have parts. The \"aham\" in this memorable expression is not closed in itself as a pure mental abstraction but it is radical openness. Between Brahman and \"aham-brahma\" lies the entire temporal universe experienced by the ignorant as a separate entity (duality).\n\nThe difference between Brahma and atma emerges most clearly where they appear side by side with one another such as - स वा अयमात्मा ब्रह्म विज्ञानमयो मनोमयः प्राणमयः – 'That Self is indeed Brahma, as also identified with the intellect, the mind and the vital-force'. The Isha Upanishad tells us that the Supreme Brahma present in the \"Mukhya Prana\" is the bearer of the secret names of \"Aham\" and \"Asmi\". Sankara proclaims that there is a plane where everything is entirely \"different\"; where laws of \"maya\" no longer apply; where distinctions like subject and object fall away; where \"Tat Tvam Asi\" and \"Aham Brahma asmi\" are actually felt.\n\n"}

{"id": "2274780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274780", "title": "Belief bias", "text": "Belief bias\n\nBelief bias is the tendency to judge the strength of arguments based on the plausibility of their conclusion rather than how strongly they support that conclusion. A person is more likely to accept arguments that supports a conclusion that aligns with our values, beliefs and prior knowledge, while rejecting counter arguments to the conclusion. Belief bias is an extremely common and therefore significant form of error; we can easily be blinded by our beliefs and reach the wrong conclusion. Belief bias has been found to influence various reasoning tasks, including conditional reasoning, relation reasoning and transitive reasoning.\n\nA \"syllogism\" is a kind of logical argument in which one proposition (the conclusion) is inferred from two or more others (the \"premises\") of a specific form. The classical example of a valid syllogism is:\n\nAn example of an invalid syllogism is:\n\nTypically, a majority of test subjects in studies incorrectly identify this syllogism as one in which the conclusion follows from the premises. It might be true \"in the real world\" that a) \"girls study\" and b) \"this is because they are ambitious\". However, this argument is a fallacy, because the conclusion is not supported by its premises. The validity of an argument is different from the truth of its conclusion: there are valid arguments for false conclusions and invalid arguments for true conclusions. Hence, it is an error to judge the validity of an argument from the plausibility of its conclusion. This is the reasoning error known as belief bias.\n\nWhen a person gives a response that is determined by the believability of the conclusion rather than logical validity, this is referred to as belief bias only when syllogism are used. This phenomenon is so closely related to syllogistic reasoning that when it does occur, in areas such as Wason's selection task or the THOG problem, it is called \"memory cueing\" or the \"effects of content\".\n\nMany researchers in thinking and reasoning have provided evidence for a dual-process cognitive approach to reasoning, judgement and decision making. They argue that these two systems (system 1 and system 2) engage in a constant battle for control over our brain to reason and make decisions. System 1 can be described as an automated system characterised by “unconscious” , \"intuitive\" and \"rapid\"”; whereas system 2 is said to be a controlled system, characterised by “conscious”, “Analytic” and “Slow”; some researchers (Reber 1993, Stanovich 1999) even claimed to have found a link between general intelligence and the effectiveness of decision making. It is important that note that the dual-process cognitive theory is different from the two minds hypothesis. A research done by Johnathan Evans in 2007 provided evidence for the view that System 1 which serves as a quick heuristic processor fights for control over System 2's slower analytical approach. In the experiment, participants were asked to evaluate syllogisms that have valid arguments with unconvincing conclusions; valid arguments with convincing conclusions; invalid arguments with unconvincing conclusions; invalid arguments with convincing conclusions. The results show that when the conclusion is believable, people blindly accept invalid conclusions more so than invalid arguments are accepted.\n\nVarious studies have proved that the time period of which a subject is allowed to think when evaluating arguments is related to the tendency for belief bias to take place. In a study done by Evans and Holmes in 2005, they recruited two different groups of people to answer a series of reasoning questions. One group of people were given only two seconds to answer the questions; whereas the other group of people were allowed to use as much time as they would like to answer the questions. The result obtained was that a higher percentage of incorrect answers were found in the time pressured group than the other; they concluded that this was a result of a shift in logical to belief-biased way of thinking.\n\nThe nature of the content presented can also affect belief bias of an individual as shown by a study done by Goel & Vartanian in 2011. In their experiment, 34 participants were presented with a syllogism upon each trial. Each trial were either neutral or carried some degree of negative content. Negative content involved in the experiment were politically incorrect social norm violations, such as the statement “Some wars are not unjustified, Some wars involve raping of women, therefore, Some raping of women is not unjustified”. For syllogisms where the content was neutral, the results were consistent with studies of belief bias; however, for syllogisms with negative emotional content, participants were more likely to reason logically on invalid syllogisms with believable conclusions instead of automatically judging them to be valid. In other words, the effect of belief bias is reduced when the content presented is of negative emotion. According to Goel and Vartanian, this is a because negative emotions prompts us to reason in more careful and in more detail. This argument was supported by the observation that for questions with negative emotions, the reaction time taken was significantly longer than that of questions that a neutral.\n\nIn an experiment done by Evans, Newstead, Allen & Pollard in 1994, where subjects were given detailed instructions which lack specific reference to the notion of logical necessity when answering questions, it was shown that a larger proportion of answers actually rejected invalid arguments with convincing conclusions as opposed to when no further instructions were given when the subjects were asked to answer the questions. The results of the experiments reflects that when elaborated instructions were given to subjects to reason logically, the effects of belief bias is decreased.\n\nIn a series of experiments by Evans, Barston and Pollard (1983), participants were presented with evaluation task paradigms, containing two premises and a conclusion. The participants were asked to make an evaluation of logical validity. The subjects, however, exhibited a belief bias, evidenced by their tendency to reject valid arguments with unbelievable conclusions, and endorse invalid arguments with believable conclusions. Instead of following directions and assessing logical validity, the subjects based their assessments on personal beliefs.\n\nConsequently, these results demonstrated a greater acceptance of more believable (80%), than unbelievable (33%) conclusions. Participants also illustrated evidence of logical competences and the results determined an increase in acceptance of valid (73%) than invalid (41%). Additionally, there's a small difference between believable and valid (89%) in comparison to unbelievable and invalid (56%) (Evans, Barston & Pollard, 1983; Morley, Evans & Handley, 2004).\n\nIt has been argued that using more realistic content in syllogisms can facilitate more normative performance from participants. It has been suggested that the use of more abstract, artificial content will also have a biasing effect on performance. Therefore, more research is required to understand fully how and why belief bias occurs and if there are certain mechanisms that are responsible for such things. There is also evidence of clear individual differences in normative responding that are predicted by the response times of participants.\n\nA 1989 study by Markovits and Nantel gave participants four reasoning tasks. The results indicated “a significant belief-bias effect” that existed “independently of the subjects' abstract reasoning ability.”\n\nA 2010 study by Donna Torrens examined differences in belief bias among individuals. Torrens found that “the extent of an individual's belief bias effect was unrelated to a number of measures of reasoning competence” but was, instead, related to that person's ability “to generate alternative representations of premises: the more alternatives a person generated, the less likely they were to show a belief bias effect.\"\n\nIn a 2010 study, Chad Dube and Caren M. Rotello of the University of Massachusetts and Evan Heit of the University of California, Merced, showed that “the belief bias effect is simply a response bias effect.”\n\nIn a 2012 study, Adrian P. Banks of the University of Surrey explained that “belief bias is caused by the believability of a conclusion in working memory which influences its activation level, determining its likelihood of retrieval and therefore its effect on the reasoning process.”\n\nMichelle Colleen and Elizabeth Hilscher of the University of Toronto showed in 2014 that belief bias can be affected by the difficulty level and placement of the syllogism in question.\n\n\n"}

The purpose is to protect those rights against infringement from public officials and private citizens. \n\nBills of rights may be \"entrenched\" or \"unentrenched\". An entrenched bill of rights cannot be amended or repealed by a country's legislature through regular procedure, instead requiring a supermajority or referendum; often it is part of a country's constitution, and therefore subject to special procedures applicable to constitutional amendments. A bill of rights that is \"not entrenched\" is a normal statute law and as such can be modified or repealed by the legislature at will. \n\nIn practice, not every jurisdiction enforces the protection of the rights articulated in its bill of rights.\n\nThe history of legal charters asserting certain rights for particular groups goes back to the Middle Ages. An example is Magna Carta, an English legal charter agreed between the King and his barons in 1215. In the early modern period, there was renewed interest in Magna Carta. English common law judge Sir Edward Coke revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed such rights. The Petition of Right 1628, the Declaration of Right, 1689 and the Bill of Rights 1689 established certain rights in statute.\n\nIn America, the English Bill of Rights was one of the influences on the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights, which in turn influenced the United States Declaration of Independence later that year.\n\nInspired by the Age of Enlightenment, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen asserted the universality of rights. It was adopted in 1789 by France's National Constituent Assembly, during the period of the French Revolution.\n\nAfter the Constitution of the United States was adopted in 1789, the United States Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791.\n\nThe 20th century saw different groups draw on these earlier documents for influence when drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nThe constitution of the United Kingdom remains uncodified, however the Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law.\n\nAustralia is the only common law country with neither a constitutional nor federal legislative bill of rights to protect its citizens, although there is ongoing debate in many of Australia's states. In 1973, Federal Attorney-General Lionel Murphy introduced a human rights Bill into parliament, although it was never passed. In 1984, Senator Stephen Bunce drafted a Bill of Rights, but it was never introduced into parliament, and in 1985, Senator Lionel Bowen introduced a bill of rights, which was passed by the House of Representatives, but failed to pass the Senate. Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard has argued against a bill of rights for Australia on the grounds it would transfer power from elected politicians (populist politics) to unelected (constitutional) judges and bureaucrats. Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) are the only states and territories to have a human rights Act. However, the principle of legality present in the Australian judicial system, seeks to ensure that legislation is interpreted so as not to interfere with basic human rights, unless legislation expressly intends to interfere.\n\n\n\n"}

The dictionary definition of deprogramming is \"to free\" or \"to retrain\" someone from specific beliefs. Some controversial methods and practices of self-identified \"deprogrammers\" have involved kidnapping, false imprisonment, and coercion, which have sometimes resulted in criminal convictions of the deprogrammers. Some deprogramming regimens are designed for individuals taken against their will, which has led to controversies over freedom of religion, kidnapping, and civil rights, as well as the violence which is sometimes involved.\n\nAs a technique, the deprogramming that has been practiced over the last half century has been typically commissioned by relatives, often parents of adult offspring, who objected to the subject's membership in an organization or group. It has been compared to exorcisms in both methodology and manifestation, and the process sometimes has been performed with tacit support of law enforcement and judicial officials. In response to a burgeoning number of new religious movements in the 1970s in the United States, the \"father of deprogramming\", Ted Patrick, introduced many of these techniques to a wider audience as a means to combat cults. Since then, deprogrammings have been carried out \"by the thousands\". For example, various atrocity stories served as justification for deprogramming of Unification Church members in the USA.\n\nAs a technique for encouraging people to disassociate with groups with whom they have as consenting adults chosen to associate, deprogramming is a controversial practice. Even some cult critics have denounced it on legal and ethical grounds. Similar actions, when done without force, have been referred to as \"exit counseling\". \nSometimes the word \"deprogramming\" is used in a wider (and/or ironic or humorous sense), to mean the freeing of someone (often oneself) from any previously uncritically assimilated idea. According to Carol Giambalvo, \"exit cousellors are usually former cult members themselves\".\n\nVarious academics have commented on the practice. For example, as defined by James T. Richardson, UNLV Professor of Sociology and Judicial Studies and Director of the Grant Sawyer Center for Justice Studies, deprogramming is a \"private, self-help process whereby participants in unpopular new religious movements (NRMs) were forcibly removed from the group, incarcerated, and put through radical resocialization processes that were supposed to result in their agreeing to leave the group.\" Law professor Douglas Laycock, author of \"Religious Liberty: The free exercise clause\", wrote:\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, many parents responded to the initial conversion with \"deprogramming.\" The essence of deprogramming was to physically abduct the convert, isolate him and physically restrain him, and barrage him with continuous arguments and attacks against his new religion, threatening to hold him forever until he agreed to leave it.\n\nLawyer John LeMoult, writing in a law review journal, described such practices as the person subject to deprogramming being \"seized, held against his will, subjected to mental, emotional, and even physical pressures until he renounces his beliefs\", and compared this power to that of Nazis over their prisoners. Legal scholar Dean M. Kelley called deprogramming \"protracted spiritual gang-rape\".\n\nThere has never been a standard procedure among deprogrammers; descriptions in anecdotal reports, studies, and interviews with former deprogrammers vary greatly. Deprogrammers generally operate on the presumption that the people they are paid to extract from religious organizations are victims of mind control (or brainwashing). Books written by deprogrammers and exit counselors say that the most essential part of freeing the mind of a person is to convince the subject that he or she had been under the mental control of others.\n\nTed Patrick, one of the pioneers of deprogramming, used a confrontational method, enlisting psychiatrists and psychologists to assist him in the deprogramming process. Patrick was tried and convicted of multiple felonies related to kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment of deprogramming subjects.\n\nSylvia Buford, an associate of Ted Patrick who has assisted him on many deprogrammings, described five stages of deprogramming:\n\nThe deprogramming accounts vary widely regarding the use of force, with the most dramatic accounts coming from deprogrammed people who returned to the group.\n\nSteven Hassan in his book \"Releasing the Bonds\" spoke against coercive deprogramming methods using force or threats.\n\nThe deprogramming case observed by Dubrow-Eichel did not include any violence.\n\nSociologist Eileen Barker wrote in Watching for Violence:\n\nIn \"Colombrito vs. Kelly\", the Court accepted the definition of deprogramming by J. Le Moult published in 1978 in the Fordham Law Review:\n\nDeprogrammer Carol Giambalvo writes in the 1998 text \"Deprogramming to Thought Reform Consultation\":\n\nAlan W. Gomes (chairman of the department of theology at Talbot School of Theology, Biola University) in his 2009 book \"Unmasking the Cults\" reports:\n\nThe Dialog Center International (DCI) a major Christian counter-cult organization founded in 1973 by a Danish professor of missiology and ecumenical theology, Dr. Johannes Aagaard rejects deprogramming, believing that it is counterproductive, ineffective, and can harm the relationship between a cult member and concerned family members.\n\nProfessor of psychiatry Saul Levine suggests that it is doubtful that deprogramming helps many people and goes on to say that it actually causes harm to the victim by very nature of the deprogramming. For deprogramming to work, the victim must be convinced that they joined a religious group against their will. They then must renounce responsibility and accept that in some mysterious way that their minds were controlled. It is Levine's professional opinion that once deprogrammed, a person would never be certain that they were really doing what they want. He states that deprogramming destroys a person's identity and is likely to create permanent anxiety about freedom of choice and leave the deprogrammed subject dependent upon the guidance and advice of others. \"Fundamentally deprogramming denies choice and creates dependency. It robs people of their sense of responsibility. Instead of encouraging people to accept that they made a mistake, it encourages people to deny their actions and blame others.\"\n\nDeprogramming activities often fall outside of the law. Government agencies have at times been aware and have taken part in deprogramming to enforce official views of \"correct\" beliefs and behaviors. This can involve \"vigorous, even violent, efforts to dissuade people from participating in groups deemed unacceptable to the government\" and have been \"given legal sanction by the passage of laws that make illegal the activities or even the beliefs\nof the unpopular movement or group being targeted\".\n\nIn the United States, from the mid-1970s and throughout the 1980s mind control was a widely accepted theory in public opinion, and the vast majority of newspaper and magazine accounts of deprogrammings assumed that recruits' relatives were well justified to seek conservatorships and to hire deprogrammers. It took nearly 20 years for public opinion to shift.\n\nOne aspect that gradually became disturbing from a civil rights point of view, was that relatives would use deception or other ethically questionable methods—even kidnapping—to get the recruit into deprogrammers' hands, without allowing the person any recourse to a lawyer or psychiatrist of their own choosing. Previously, there would be a sanity hearing first, and only then a commitment to an asylum or involuntary therapy. But with deprogramming, judges routinely granted parents legal authority over their adult children without a hearing.\n\nOne of main objections raised to deprogramming (as well as to exit counseling) is the contention that they begin with a false premise. Lawyers for some groups who have lost members due to deprogramming, as well as some civil libertarians, sociologists and psychologists, argue that it is not the religious groups but rather the deprogrammers who are the ones who deceive and manipulate people.\n\nDavid Bromley and Anson Shupe wrote:\nA number of factors contributed to the cessation of deprogramming:\n\nSome of the deprogrammed adults sued the deprogrammers or the relatives who had hired them. Also in 1987, psychologist Margaret Singer became unusable as an expert witness after the American Psychological Association (APA) rejected her \"Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control\" (DIMPAC) report.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union published a statement in 1977 which said:\nIn the 1980s in the United States, namely in New York (Deprogramming Bill, 1981), Kansas (Deprogramming Bill, 1982), and Nebraska (conservatorship legislation for 1985), lawmakers unsuccessfully attempted to legalize involuntary deprogramming.\n\nRev. Sun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification Church (many of whose members were targets of deprogramming) issued this statement in 1983:\n\nDuring the 1990s, deprogrammer Rick Ross was sued by Jason Scott, a former member of a Pentecostal group called the Life Tabernacle Church, after an unsuccessful deprogramming attempt. In 1995, the jury awarded Scott $875,000 in compensatory damages and $2,500,000 in punitive damages against Ross, which were later settled for $5,000 and 200 hours of services. More significantly, the jury also found that the leading anti-cult group known as the Cult Awareness Network was a co-conspirator in the crime and fined CAN $1,000,000 in punitive damages, forcing the group into bankruptcy. This case is often seen as effectively closing the door on the practice of involuntary deprogramming in the United States.\n\nAnti-cult groups play a central role in maintaining the underground network of communications, referrals, transportation, and housing necessary for continued deprogramming.\n\nGroups such as the Cult Awareness Network operated a referral scheme (NARDEC) in which they would refer people to deprogrammers in return for a 'kickback' in the form of a donation or as a commission. Deprogrammers such as Rick Ross, Steven Hassan and Carol Giambalvo were amongst the CAN referred deprogrammers.\n\nIn 1974, Kathy Crampton, whose abduction and deprogramming were televised across the US, went back to the Love Family group several days after her apparently successful deprogramming. Patrick was charged with kidnapping, but acquitted with the reasoning: \"[w]here parents are, as here, of the reasonable and intelligent belief that they were not physically capable of recapturing their daughter from existing, imminent danger, then the defense of necessity transfers or transposes to the constituted agent, the person who acts upon their belief under such conditions. Here that agent is the Defendant Ted Patrick.\" \"(District Court of the United States 1974: 79; New York Times 1974).\"\n\nIn 1980, Susan Wirth, a 35-year-old teacher living in San Francisco, was abducted by her parents to be deprogrammed in reaction to her leftist political views and activities. Patrick was paid $27,000 to carry out the deprogramming, which involved handcuffing her to a bed for two weeks and denying her food. She was later released and after returning to San Francisco spoke out against deprogramming but declined to press legal charges against her parents.\n\nIn 1980, Patrick was convicted of conspiracy, kidnapping, and false imprisonment for abducting and attempting to deprogram Roberta McElfish, a 26-year-old Tucson waitress. Patrick was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $5,000.\n\nIn 1981, Stephanie Riethmiller, who lived in Ohio, was kidnapped by deprogrammers hired by her parents to end her lesbian relationship. She was held against her will and repeatedly raped. After her release she filed civil charges against her parents and the deprogrammers, which were dismissed in a trial that generated some controversy in the media.\n\nIn 1990, Patrick attempted to deprogram Elma Miller, an Amish woman who had joined a liberal sect. He was hired by her husband to return her to him and the Amish church. Criminal charges of conspiracy were filed against Miller's husband, brother, and two others but were later dropped on her request to the prosecuting attorney.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Rick Ross, a noted cult intervention advocate who took part in a number of deprogramming sessions, was sued by Jason Scott, a former member of a Pentecostalist group called the Life Tabernacle Church (part of United Pentecostal Church International), after an unsuccessful coercive deprogramming. The jury awarded Scott $875,000 in compensatory damages and $1,000,000 in punitive damages against the Cult Awareness Network (CAN), and $2,500,000 against Ross (later settled for $5,000 and 200 hours of services \"as an expert consultant and intervention specialist\").\n\nDeprogramming and exit counseling, sometimes seen as one and the same, are distinct approaches to convincing a person to leave a cult.\n\nProponents of the distinction, however, state that deprogramming entails coercion and confinement, while exit counseling assures the subject of the freedom to leave at any time. Deprogramming typically costs $10,000 or more, mainly because of the expense of a security team. Exit counseling typically costs $2,000 to $4,000, including expenses, for a three- to five-day intervention, although cases requiring extensive research of little-known groups can cost much more (estimated in 1993). Deprogramming, especially when it fails, entails considerable legal and psychological risk (for example, a permanent alienation of the subject from his or her family). The psychological and legal risks in exit counseling are significantly reduced. Although deprogrammers do prepare families for the process, exit counselors tend to work with them directly, expecting those requesting the intervention to contribute more to the process; that is, exit counseling requires that families establish a reasonable and respectful level of communication with their loved one before the program itself can begin. Because deprogramming relies on coercion, which is illegal except in the case of conservatorship and is generally viewed as unethical, deprogrammers' critiques of the unethical practices of cults tend to be less credibility to the subject than the arguments of exit counselors.\n\nSteven Hassan, author of the book \"Combatting Cult Mind Control\", states that he took part in a number of deprogrammings in the late 1970s, and has spoken out against them since 1980. Hassan states that he has not participated in any deprogrammings since then, although on page 114 of \"Combatting\", Hassan states that deprogrammings should be kept as a last resort if all other attempts fail to transform the individual. Hassan is one of the major proponents of exit counseling as a form of intercession, and he refers to his method as \"strategic intervention therapy\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is used worldwide, but primarily in Europe, especially in German-speaking countries and by repertory opera houses.\n\nThe ' system is a convenience for singers and opera houses. It prevents singers from being asked to sing roles which they are incapable of performing. Opera companies keep lists of available singers by ' so that when they are casting roles for an upcoming production, they do not inadvertently contact performers who would be inappropriate for the part.\n\nBelow is a list of ' (), their ranges as written on sheet music, and roles generally considered appropriate to each. When two names for the ' are given, the first is in more common use today. Where possible, an English and/or Italian equivalent of each ' is listed; however, not all ' have ready English or Italian equivalents. Note that some roles can be sung by more than one ' and that many singers do not easily fit into a ': for instance some sopranos may sing both ' and ' roles. In addition, roles traditionally more difficult to cast may be given to a voice other than the traditional \"\". For instance, the \"Queen of the Night\" is more traditionally a dramatic coloratura role, but it is difficult to find a dramatic coloratura to sing it (particularly given the extreme range). Therefore, the role is often sung by a lyric coloratura.\n\n\nOne must not mistake the Mozartian dramatic coloratura soprano with the Italian dramatic coloratura soprano. A singer that sings Konstanze, Donna Anna or Fiordiligi can not necessarily sing the Italian dramatic coloratura parts, due to other vocal demands. Imogene, Leonora and Violetta require a dramatic soprano voice and are most often sung by dramatic sopranos with an agile voice that can easily produce coloratura and high notes. Roles like Norma, Lady Macbeth, Odabella or Abigaille are good examples of Italian roles that are not necessarily a coloratura soprano (even though the score calls for coloratura singing), but a full bodied dramatic soprano with a voice that can handle extreme dramatic singing and that is flexible enough to sing coloratura. Giuseppe Verdi wrote many parts like this in his early years.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo roles mentioned above, Salome and the Marschallin, are relatively high dramatic sopranos and require that the soprano can endure long stretches of very high tessitura. Richard Strauss himself said that Salome should be sung by someone with the flexibility of a dramatic coloratura due to the high tessitura.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33321597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33321597", "title": "Fear-potentiated startle", "text": "Fear-potentiated startle\n\nFear-potentiated startle (FPS) is a reflexive physiological reaction to a presented stimulus, and is an indicator of the fear reaction in an organism. The FPS response can be elicited in the face of any threatening stimulus (e.g., any object, person or situation that would cause someone to experience feelings of fear), but it can also be elicited by a neutral stimulus as a result of fear conditioning, a process that occurs when a benign stimulus comes to evoke fear and anxiety upon being paired with a traumatic or fear-provoking event. The stimulus in question is usually of auditory (e.g., loud noise) or visual (e.g., bright light) nature, and startle response measures include eyeblink rates and pulse/heart rate. The negative impact of heightened FPS in the face of neutral stimuli can be treated pharmacologically, using psychotropic medications that are typically used to reduce anxiety in humans. Recent literature, moreover, has implicated increased FPS responses as a correlate in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders.\n\nThe central brain structure through which fear-associated responses are mediated has been determined to be the amygdala, which is located in the brain’s temporal lobe. When the central nucleus of the amygdala is stimulated - what is popularly referred to as the “fight-or-flight” response is activated - the organism in question reacts passively (is rendered frozen in its tracks, becomes hyper-vigilantly attentive, etc.), or displays a physiological reaction geared toward facilitating an aggressive reaction (e.g., increased heart-rate/pulse, rapid breathing). These fear-induced reactions result from communication between the amygdala and a variety of other brain regions (such as the brain stem and hypothalamus), resulting in a variety of physiological responses in the organism. For instance, communication between an activated amygdala and the lateral hypothalamus results in increased blood pressure and dilation of the pupils; the initiation of the central grey via communication from the amygdala results in the organism's becoming frozen in its tracks; communication between the activated amygdala and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus releases hormones associated with stress (biology).\n\nLiterature has linked the FPS response to interplay between the central nucleus of the amgydala and both the central grey and nucleus reticular pontis caudalis. Insult (e.g., traumatic brain injury) to these brain areas inhibits any display of FPS response in humans. In addition, a distinction has been made concerning neural activity of the reflexive FPS response, and that which occurs in the face of exposure to a fear-inducing stimulus over a long period of time, such as abuse or combat or to a place or situation. Literature suggests that, in such situations, FPS is caused by activation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminals. Insult to this brain region inhibiting FPS response in the face of longitudinally conditioned or situation/location-related threatening stimuli in rats. The extinction of heightened FPS response to stimuli previously conditioned to be threatening has been linked to activity in the medial prefrontal cortex.\n\nThe most common physiological response measured to gauge FPS response in humans is eyeblink, or the reflexive act of blinking. Currently, the most widely accepted/used means with which to measure the eyeblink reflex is by using a technology called electromyographic recording (EMG). EMG provides eyeblink rate data by measuring and recording activity of the eyelid muscles using two electrodes. In order to obtain an optimal reading, the person’s skin must be cleaned, dried, and covered with a thin layer of electrode gel in only the spots where the measures will be taken; one electrode is placed in the center of the person’s forehead above the nose, and two recording electrodes are placed directly underneath the eye, approximately two centimeters apart. The participant should be looking forward for the duration of data collection. If noises are used as the catalyst for the FPS response in a study (acoustic startle), the volume must be both controlled and reported, as noises around 50/60 Hz can compromise the accuracy of the recordings taken by the EMG.\n\nSpecifically measuring FPS response in studies of fear is highly practical, as the experimental and baseline measures of an individual’s startle response can be partitioned, and variance in startle can, in turn, be attributed to fear (or lack thereof, in the case that extinction of fear is variable of interest), allowing illusory correlates (other variables that can also appear to cause an effect on our variable of interest) to be ruled out. There are several experimental climates that can be used to examine the FPS response. Eyeblink FPS response is typically gauged by presenting participants with pleasant and unpleasant (as well as neutral) emotionally evocative stimuli, paired with a loud noise or a flash of bright lights. The presented stimuli can be replaced by having participants imagine emotionally evocative stimuli of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral natures. FPS response is typically most exaggerated in response to emotionally unpleasant stimuli, followed by pleasant and then neutral stimuli, in members of the general population.\n\nIn addition, FPS response in research concerning fear conditioning (and extinction of a conditioned aversion to a previously neutral stimulus) is also commonly examined; such studies will present noise or light startle probes with unpleasant stimuli to condition the FPS to occur in the presence of that stimuli. Measurements of FPS response in response to both the conditioned stimuli and the neutral stimuli (in the absence of light or sound probes) are then taken, with the measured difference in the size of startle response being the variable of interest, as this difference score indicates alteration of naturally occurring and conditioned FPS response. Resulting data from such studies can be used to examine both FPS response in light of conditioned fear, and an individual’s ability to break the conditioned fear reactions (extinction).\n\nA heightened (or abnormally overactive) startle response in the face of benign stimuli/settings is often seen in individuals suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a psychological ailment characterized by maladaptive and inappropriate affective and physiological reactions to stimuli that can be associated with a previously experienced trauma. For instance, combat veterans often experience psychological and physiological panic / anxiety / dissociative “flashbacks” to the traumatic experience that triggered the PTSD pathology in reaction to unexpected loud noises, a stimulus that can remind the individual of gunshots, bombs, or exploding grenades.\n\nIndividuals with PTSD have been shown to have an increased FPS response, and data have also suggested that this response becomes further exaggerated when these individuals experience stress. People having been diagnosed with PTSD display similar FPS response to threatening and neutral stimuli, indicating that (unlike those not suffering from PTSD) these individuals have difficulty distinguishing a stimulus as posing a threat or being benign. Additionally, data has displayed a significantly reduced ability for the extinction of conditioned fear responses in combat Veterans with severe, chronic PTSD The reduced ability for fear extinction over longer periods of time in combat veterans, as a result of the pathology associated with PTSD, has also been asserted.\n\nHeightened FPS response has also been implicated in the following disorders, falling under the current DSM-IV-TR classification of anxiety disorders: phobia (social and specific) and obsessive-compulsive disorder. On the converse, mood disorders such as depression have been shown to cause weakened FPS responses in diagnosed individuals.\n\nAs exaggerated FPS responses can lend to the pathology associated with PTSD and other disorders of the anxiety disorder classification, decreasing the startle response in humans may be of benefit in the treatment of these psychological disorders. Several forms of medication acting on different neurotransmitters (e.g., GABA, dopamine) in the brain have been shown to cause significant reductions in startle response; the medications that are effective in treating conditioned fear are those typically used in the treatment of anxiety.\n"}
{"id": "46006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46006", "title": "Freedom of religion", "text": "Freedom of religion\n\nFreedom of religion is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance. It also includes the freedom to change one's religion or beliefs.\n\nFreedom of religion is considered by many people and most of the nations to be a fundamental human right. In a country with a state religion, freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths.\nFreedom of belief is different. It allows the right to believe what a person, group or religion wishes, but it does not necessarily allow the right to practice the religion or belief openly and outwardly in a public manner.\n\nHistorically, \"freedom of religion\" has been used to refer to the tolerance of different theological systems of belief, while \"freedom of worship\" has been defined as freedom of individual action. Nevertheless, freedom \"from\" religion is a far more pressing moralistic, legal, and peaceful solution. Each of these have existed to varying degrees. While many countries have accepted some form of religious freedom, this has also often been limited in practice through punitive taxation, repressive social legislation, and political disenfranchisement. Compare examples of individual freedom in Italy or the Muslim tradition of dhimmis, literally \"protected individuals\" professing an officially tolerated non-Muslim religion.\nIn Antiquity, a syncretic point of view often allowed communities of traders to operate under their own customs. When street mobs of separate quarters clashed in a Hellenistic or Roman city, the issue was generally perceived to be an infringement of community rights.\n\nCyrus the Great established the Achaemenid Empire ca. 550 BC, and initiated a general policy of permitting religious freedom throughout the empire, documenting this on the Cyrus Cylinder.\n\nSome of the historical exceptions have been in regions where one of the revealed religions has been in a position of power: Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Islam. Others have been where the established order has felt threatened, as shown in the trial of Socrates in 399 BC or where the ruler has been deified, as in Rome, and refusal to offer token sacrifice was similar to refusing to take an oath of allegiance. This was the core for resentment and the persecution of early Christian communities.\n\nFreedom of religious worship was established in the Buddhist Maurya Empire of ancient India by Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BC, which was encapsulated in the Edicts of Ashoka.\n\nGreek-Jewish clashes at Cyrene in 73 AD and 117 AD and in Alexandria in 115 AD provide examples of cosmopolitan cities as scenes of tumult.\n\nThe Romans tolerated most religions, including Judaism and encouraged local subjects to continue worshipping their own gods. They did not however, tolerate Christianity until it was legalised by the Roman emperor Galerius in 311. The Edict of Milan guaranteed freedom of religion in the Roman Empire until the Edict of Thessalonica in 380, which outlawed all religions except Christianity.\n\nFollowing a period of fighting lasting around a hundred years before 620 AD which mainly involved Arab and Jewish inhabitants of Medina (then known as \"Yathrib\"), religious freedom for Muslims, Jews and pagans was declared by Muhammad in the Constitution of Medina. The Islamic Caliphate later guaranteed religious freedom under the conditions that non-Muslim communities accept \"dhimmi\" status and their adult males pay the punitive \"jizya\" tax instead of the \"zakat\" paid by Muslim citizens. Though Dhimmis were not given the same political rights as Muslims, they nevertheless did enjoy equality under the laws of property, contract, and obligation.\n\nReligious pluralism existed in classical Islamic ethics and Sharia, as the religious laws and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early Caliphate, Al-Andalus, Indian subcontinent, and the Ottoman Millet system. In medieval Islamic societies, the \"qadi\" (Islamic judges) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily choose to be judged according to Islamic law, thus the \"dhimmi\" communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who would have their own \"Halakha\" courts.\n\nDhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order. Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that were usually forbidden by Islamic law, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork, as well as religious practices which Muslims found repugnant, such as the Zoroastrian practice of incestuous \"self-marriage\" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar Ibn Qayyim (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.\n\nDespite Dhimmis enjoying special statuses under the Caliphates, they were not considered equals, and sporadic persecutions of non-Muslim groups did occur in the history of the Caliphates.\n\nAncient Jews fleeing from persecution in their homeland 2,500 years ago settled in India and never faced anti-Semitism. Freedom of religion edicts have been found written during Ashoka the Great's reign in the 3rd century BC. Freedom to practise, preach and propagate any religion is a constitutional right in Modern India. Most major religious festivals of the main communities are included in the list of national holidays.\n\nAlthough India is an 80% Hindu country, India is a secular state without any state religions.\n\nMany scholars and intellectuals believe that India's predominant religion, Hinduism, has long been a most tolerant religion. Rajni Kothari, founder of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies has written, \"[India] is a country built on the foundations of a civilisation that is fundamentally non-religious.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama, the Tibetan leader in exile, said that religious tolerance of 'Aryabhoomi,' a reference to India found in the Mahabharata, has been in existence in this country from thousands of years. \"Not only Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism which are the native religions but also Christianity and Islam have flourished here. Religious tolerance is inherent in Indian tradition,\" the Dalai Lama said.\n\nFreedom of religion in the Indian subcontinent is exemplified by the reign of King Piyadasi (304–232 BC) (Ashoka). One of King Ashoka's main concerns was to reform governmental institutes and exercise moral principles in his attempt to create a just and humane society. Later he promoted the principles of Buddhism, and the creation of a just, understanding and fair society was held as an important principle for many ancient rulers of this time in the East.\n\nThe importance of freedom of worship in India was encapsulated in an inscription of Ashoka:\n\nOn the main Asian continent, the Mongols were tolerant of religions. People could worship as they wished freely and openly.\n\nAfter the arrival of Europeans, Christians in their zeal to convert local as per belief in conversion as service of God, have also been seen to fall into frivolous methods since their arrival, though by and large there are hardly any reports of law and order disturbance from mobs with Christian beliefs, except perhaps in the north eastern region of India.\n\nFreedom of religion in contemporary India is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 25 of the nation's constitution. Accordingly, every citizen of India has a right to profess, practice and propagate their religions peacefully. Vishwa Hindu Parishad counters this argument by saying that evangelical Christians are forcefully (or through money) converting rural, illiterate populations and they are only trying to stop this.\n\nIn September 2010, the Indian state of Kerala's State Election Commissioner announced that \"Religious heads cannot issue calls to vote for members of a particular community or to defeat the nonbelievers\". The Catholic Church comprising Latin, Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara rites used to give clear directions to the faithful on exercising their franchise during elections through pastoral letters issued by bishops or council of bishops. The pastoral letter issued by Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) on the eve of the poll urged the faithful to shun atheists.\n\nEven today, most Indians celebrate all religious festivals with equal enthusiasm and respect. Hindu festivals like Deepavali and Holi, Muslim festivals like Eid al-Fitr, Eid-Ul-Adha, Muharram, Christian festivals like Christmas and other festivals like Buddha Purnima, Mahavir Jayanti, Gur Purab etc. are celebrated and enjoyed by all Indians.\n\nMost Roman Catholic kingdoms kept a tight rein on religious expression throughout the Middle Ages. Jews were alternately tolerated and persecuted, the most notable examples of the latter being the expulsion of all Jews from Spain in 1492. Some of those who remained and converted were tried as heretics in the Inquisition for allegedly practicing Judaism in secret. Despite the persecution of Jews, they were the most tolerated non-Catholic faith in Europe.\n\nHowever, the latter was in part a reaction to the growing movement that became the Reformation. As early as 1380, John Wycliffe in England denied transubstantiation and began his translation of the Bible into English. He was condemned in a Papal Bull in 1410, and all his books were burned.\n\nIn 1414, Jan Hus, a Bohemian preacher of reformation, was given a safe conduct by the Holy Roman Emperor to attend the Council of Constance. Not entirely trusting in his safety, he made his will before he left. His forebodings proved accurate, and he was burned at the stake on 6 July 1415. The Council also decreed that Wycliffe's remains be disinterred and cast out. This decree was not carried out until 1429.\n\nAfter the fall of the city of Granada, Spain, in 1492, the Muslim population was promised religious freedom by the Treaty of Granada, but that promise was short-lived. In 1501, Granada's Muslims were given an ultimatum to either convert to Christianity or to emigrate. The majority converted, but only superficially, continuing to dress and speak as they had before and to secretly practice Islam. The Moriscos (converts to Christianity) were ultimately expelled from Spain between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by Philip III.\n\nMartin Luther published his famous 95 Theses in Wittenberg on 31 October 1517. His major aim was theological, summed up in the three basic dogmas of Protestantism:\n\n\nIn consequence, Luther hoped to stop the sale of indulgences and to reform the Church from within. In 1521, he was given the chance to recant at the Diet of Worms before Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. After he refused to recant, he was declared heretic. Partly for his own protection, he was sequestered on the Wartburg in the possessions of Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, where he translated the New Testament into German. He was excommunicated by Papal Bull in 1521.\n\nHowever, the movement continued to gain ground in his absence and spread to Switzerland. Huldrych Zwingli preached reform in Zürich from 1520 to 1523. He opposed the sale of indulgences, celibacy, pilgrimages, pictures, statues, relics, altars, and organs. This culminated in outright war between the Swiss cantons that accepted Protestantism and the Catholics. The Catholics were victorious, and Zwingli was killed in battle in 1531. The Catholic cantons were magnanimous in victory.\n\nThe defiance of Papal authority proved contagious, and in 1533, when Henry VIII of England was excommunicated for his divorce and remarriage to Anne Boleyn, he promptly established a state church with bishops appointed by the crown. This was not without internal opposition, and Thomas More, who had been his Lord Chancellor, was executed in 1535 for opposition to Henry.\n\nIn 1535, the Swiss canton of Geneva became Protestant. In 1536, the Bernese imposed the reformation on the canton of Vaud by conquest. They sacked the cathedral in Lausanne and destroyed all its art and statuary. John Calvin, who had been active in Geneva was expelled in 1538 in a power struggle, but he was invited back in 1540.\nThe same kind of seesaw back and forth between Protestantism and Catholicism was evident in England when Mary I of England returned that country briefly to the Catholic fold in 1553 and persecuted Protestants. However, her half-sister, Elizabeth I of England was to restore the Church of England in 1558, this time permanently, and began to persecute Catholics again. The King James Bible commissioned by King James I of England and published in 1611 proved a landmark for Protestant worship, with official Catholic forms of worship being banned.\n\nIn France, although peace was made between Protestants and Catholics at the Treaty of Saint Germain in 1570, persecution continued, most notably in the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day on 24 August 1572, in which thousands of Protestants throughout France were killed. A few years before, at the \"Michelade\" of Nîmes in 1567, Protestants had massacred the local Catholic clergy.\n\nThe Norman Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II was characterized by its multi-ethnic nature and religious tolerance. Normans, Jews, Muslim Arabs, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and native Sicilians lived in harmony. Rather than exterminate the Muslims of Sicily, Roger II's grandson Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1215–1250) allowed them to settle on the mainland and build mosques. Not least, he enlisted them in his Christian army and even into his personal bodyguards.\n\nBohemia (present-day Czech Republic) enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1520, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period of time. The so-called Basel Compacts of 1436 declared the freedom of religion and peace between Catholics and Utraquists. In 1609 Emperor Rudolf II granted Bohemia greater religious liberty with his Letter of Majesty. The privileged position of the Catholic Church in the Czech kingdom was firmly established after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620. Gradually freedom of religion in Bohemian lands came to an end and Protestants fled or were expelled from the country. A devout Catholic, Emperor Ferdinand II forcibly converted Austrian and Bohemian Protestants.\n\nIn the meantime, in Germany Philip Melanchthon drafted the Augsburg Confession as a common confession for the Lutherans and the free territories. It was presented to Charles V in 1530.\n\nIn the Holy Roman Empire, Charles V agreed to tolerate Lutheranism in 1555 at the Peace of Augsburg. Each state was to take the religion of its prince, but within those states, there was not necessarily religious tolerance. Citizens of other faiths could relocate to a more hospitable environment.\n\nIn France, from the 1550s, many attempts to reconcile Catholics and Protestants and to establish tolerance failed because the State was too weak to enforce them. It took the victory of prince Henry IV of France, who had converted into Protestantism, and his accession to the throne, to impose religious tolerance formalized in the Edict of Nantes in 1598. It would remain in force for over 80 years until its revocation in 1685 by Louis XIV of France. Intolerance remained the norm until Louis XVI, who signed the Edict of Versailles (1787), then the constitutional text of 24 December 1789, granting civilian rights to Protestants. The French Revolution then abolished state religion and confiscated all Church property, turning intolerance against Catholics.\n\nIn 1558, the Transylvanian Diet's Edict of Torda declared free practice of both Catholicism and Lutheranism. Calvinism, however, was prohibited. Calvinism was included among the accepted religions in 1564. Ten years after the first law, in 1568, the same Diet, under the chairmanship of King of Hungary, and Prince of Transylvania John Sigismund Zápolya (John II.), following the teaching of Ferenc Dávid, the founder of the Unitarian Church of Transylvania, extended the freedom to all religions, declaring that \"It is not allowed to anybody to intimidate anybody with captivity or expelling for his religion\". However, it was more than a religious tolerance; it declared the equality of the religions, prohibiting all kinds of acts from authorities or from simple people, which could harm other groups or people because of their religious beliefs. The emergence in social hierarchy wasn't dependent on the religion of the person thus Transylvania had also Catholic and Protestant monarchs, who all respected the Edict of Torda. The lack of state religion was unique for centuries in Europe. Therefore, the Edict of Torda is considered as the first legal guarantee of religious freedom in Christian Europe.\n\nFour religions (Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, Unitarianism) were named as accepted religions (religo recepta), having their representatives in the Transylvanian Diet, while the other religions, like the Orthodoxs, Sabbatarians and Anabaptists were tolerated churches (religio tolerata), which meant that they had no power in the law making and no veto rights in the Diet, but they were not persecuted in any way. Thanks to the Edict of Torda, from the last decades of the 16th Century Transylvania was the only place in Europe, where so many religions could live together in harmony and without persecution.\n\nThis religious freedom ended however for some of the religions of Transylvania in 1638. After this year the Sabbatarians begun to be persecuted, and forced to convert to one of the accepted religions of Transylvania.\n\nAlso the Unitarians (despite of being one of the \"accepted religions\") started to be put under an ever-growing pressure, which culminated after the Habsburg conquest of Transylvania (1691), Also after the Habsburg occupation, the new Austrian masters forced in the middle of the 18th century the Hutterite Anabaptists (who found a safe heaven in 1621 in Transylvania, after the persecution to which they were subjected in the Austrian provinces and Moravia) to convert to Catholicism or to migrate in another country, which finally the Anabaptists did, leaving Transylvania and Hungary for Wallachia, than from there to Russia, and finally in the United States.\n\nIn the Union of Utrecht (20 January 1579), personal freedom of religion was declared in the struggle between the Northern Netherlands and Spain. The Union of Utrecht was an important step in the establishment of the Dutch Republic (from 1581 to 1795). Under Calvinist leadership, the Netherlands became the most tolerant country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, such as the Huguenots, the Dissenters, and the Jews who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal. The establishment of a Jewish community in the Netherlands and New Amsterdam (present-day New York) during the Dutch Republic is an example of religious freedom. When New Amsterdam surrendered to the English in 1664, freedom of religion was guaranteed in the Articles of Capitulation. It benefitted also the Jews who had landed on Manhattan Island in 1654, fleeing Portuguese persecution in Brazil. During the 18th century, other Jewish communities were established at Newport, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, Charleston, Savannah, and Richmond.\n\nIntolerance of dissident forms of Protestantism also continued, as evidenced by the exodus of the Pilgrims, who sought refuge, first in the Netherlands, and ultimately in America, founding Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in 1620. William Penn, the founder of Philadelphia, was involved in a case which had a profound effect upon future American laws and those of England. In a classic case of jury nullification, the jury refused to convict William Penn of preaching a Quaker sermon, which was illegal. Even though the jury was imprisoned for their acquittal, they stood by their decision and helped establish the freedom of religion.\n\nThe General Charter of Jewish Liberties known as the Statute of Kalisz was issued by the Duke of Greater Poland Boleslaus the Pious on 8 September 1264 in Kalisz. The statute served as the basis for the legal position of Jews in Poland and led to the creation of the Yiddish-speaking autonomous Jewish nation until 1795. The statute granted exclusive jurisdiction of Jewish courts over Jewish matters and established a separate tribunal for matters involving Christians and Jews. Additionally, it guaranteed personal liberties and safety for Jews including freedom of religion, travel, and trade. The statute was ratified by subsequent Polish Kings: Casimir III of Poland in 1334, Casimir IV of Poland in 1453 and Sigismund I of Poland in 1539. Poland freed Jews from direct royal authority, opening up enormous administrative and economic opportunities to them.\n\nThe right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the future Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.\n\nMost of the early colonies were generally not tolerant of dissident forms of worship, with Maryland being one of the exceptions. For example, Roger Williams found it necessary to found a new colony in Rhode Island to escape persecution in the theocratically dominated colony of Massachusetts. The Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony were the most active of the New England persecutors of Quakers, and the persecuting spirit was shared by Plymouth Colony and the colonies along the Connecticut river. In 1660, one of the most notable victims of the religious intolerance was English Quaker Mary Dyer, who was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony. As one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs, the hanging of Dyer on the Boston gallows marked the beginning of the end of the Puritan theocracy and New England independence from English rule, and in 1661 King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism. Anti-Catholic sentiment appeared in New England with the first Pilgrim and Puritan settlers. In 1647, Massachusetts passed a law prohibiting any Jesuit Roman Catholic priests from entering territory under Puritan jurisdiction. Any suspected person who could not clear himself was to be banished from the colony; a second offense carried a death penalty. The Pilgrims of New England held radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas. Christmas observance was outlawed in Boston in 1659. The ban by the Puritans was revoked in 1681 by an English appointed governor, however it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became common in the Boston region.\n\nFreedom of religion was first applied as a principle of government in the founding of the colony of Maryland, founded by the Catholic Lord Baltimore, in 1634. Fifteen years later (1649), the Maryland Toleration Act, drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: \"No person or persons...shall from henceforth be any waies troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof.\" The Act allowed freedom of worship for all Trinitarian Christians in Maryland, but sentenced to death anyone who denied the divinity of Jesus. The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed during the Cromwellian Era with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed. In 1657, the Catholic Lord Baltimore regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1658 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692 when, after Maryland's Protestant Revolution of 1689, freedom of religion was again rescinded. In addition, in 1704, an Act was passed \"to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province\", preventing Catholics from holding political office. Full religious toleration would not be restored in Maryland until the American Revolution, when Maryland's Charles Carroll of Carrollton signed the American Declaration of Independence.\n\nRhode Island (1636), Connecticut (1636), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (1682) founded by Protestants Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and William Penn, respectively combined the democratic form of government which had been developed by the Puritans and the Separatist Congregationalists in Massachusetts with religious freedom. These colonies became sanctuaries for persecuted religious minorities. Catholics and later on Jews also had full citizenship and free exercise of their religions. Williams, Hooker, Penn, and their friends were firmly convinced that freedom of conscience was the will of God. Williams gave the most profound argument: As faith is the free work of the Holy Spirit, it cannot be forced on a person. Therefore, strict separation of church and state has to be kept. Pennsylvania was the only colony that retained unlimited religious freedom until the foundation of the United States in 1776. It was the inseparable connection between democracy, religious freedom, and the other forms of freedom which became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, Baptists and Presbyterians demanded the disestablishment of state churches Anglican and Congregationalist and the protection of religious freedom.\n\nReiterating Maryland's and the other colonies' earlier colonial legislation, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, written in 1779 by Thomas Jefferson, proclaimed:\n\n[N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\n\nThose sentiments also found expression in the First Amendment of the national constitution, part of the United States' Bill of Rights: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\"\n\nThe United States formally considers religious freedom in its foreign relations. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 established the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom which investigates the records of over 200 other nations with respect to religious freedom, and makes recommendations to submit nations with egregious records to ongoing scrutiny and possible economic sanctions. Many human rights organizations have urged the United States to be still more vigorous in imposing sanctions on countries that do not permit or tolerate religious freedom.\n\nFreedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. Canadian law goes further, requiring that private citizens and companies provide reasonable accommodation to those, for example, with strong religious beliefs. The Canadian Human Rights Act allows an exception to reasonable accommodation with respect to religious dress, such as a Sikh turban, when there is a \"bona fide\" occupational requirement, such as a workplace requiring a hard hat.\n\nOn 25 November 1981, the United Nations General Assembly passed the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. This declaration recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right in accordance with several other instruments of international law.\n\nHowever, the most substantial binding legal instruments that guarantee the right to freedom of religion that was passed by the international community is the Convention on the Rights of the Child which states in its Article 14: \"States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.\"\n\nIn 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \"protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief.\" The committee further stated that \"the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views.\" Signatories to the convention are barred from \"the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers\" to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, minority religions still are persecuted in many parts of the world.\n\nThe French philosopher Voltaire noted in his book on English society, \"Letters on the English\", that freedom of religion in a diverse society was deeply important to maintaining peace in that country. That it was also important in understanding why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace.Adam Smith, in his book \"The Wealth of Nations\" (using an argument first put forward by his friend and contemporary David Hume), states that in the long run it is in the best interests of society as a whole and the civil magistrate (government) in particular to allow people to freely choose their own religion, as it helps prevent civil unrest and reduces intolerance. So long as there are enough different religions and/or religious sects operating freely in a society then they are all compelled to moderate their more controversial and violent teachings, so as to be more appealing to more people and so have an easier time attracting new converts. It is this free competition amongst religious sects for converts that ensures stability and tranquillity in the long run.\n\nSmith also points out that laws that prevent religious freedom and seek to preserve the power and belief in a particular religion will, in the long run, only serve to weaken and corrupt that religion, as its leaders and preachers become complacent, disconnected and unpractised in their ability to seek and win over new converts:\n\nHinduism is one of the more broad-minded religions when it comes to religious freedom. It respects the right of everyone to reach God in their own way. Hindus believe in different ways to preach attainment of God and religion as a philosophy and hence respect all religions as equal. One of the famous Hindu sayings about religion is: \"Truth is one; sages call it by different names.\"\n\nJudaism includes multiple streams, such as Orthodox, Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism, Jewish Renewal and Humanistic Judaism. However, Judaism also exists in many forms as a civilization, possessing characteristics known as peoplehood, rather than strictly as a religion. In the Torah, Jews are forbidden to practice idolatry and are commanded to root out pagan and idolatrous practices within their midst, including killing idolaters who sacrifice children to their gods, or engage in immoral activities. However, these laws are not adhered to anymore as Jews have usually lived among a multi-religious community.\n\nAfter the conquest of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judea by the Roman Empire, a Jewish state did not exist until 1948 with the establishment of the State of Israel. For over 1500 years Jewish people lived under pagan, Christian, Muslim, etc. rule. As such Jewish people in some of these states faced persecution. From the pogroms in Europe during the Middle Ages to the establishment of segregated Jewish ghettos during World War II. In the Middle East, Jews were categorised as dhimmi, non- Muslims permitted to live within a Muslim state. Even though given rights within a Muslim state, a dhimmi is still not equal to a Muslim within Muslim society, the same way non-Jewish Israeli citizens are not equal with Jewish citizens in modern-day Israel.\n\nPossibly because of this history of long term persecution, Jews in modernity have been among the most active proponents of religious freedom in the US and abroad and have founded and supported anti-hate institutions, including the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union. Jews are very active in supporting Muslim and other religious groups in the US against discrimination and hate crimes and most Jewish congregations throughout the US and many individual Jews participate in interfaith community projects and programs.\n\nThe State of Israel was established for the Jewish diaspora after World War II. While the Israel Declaration of Independence stresses religious freedom as a fundamental principle, in practice the current government, dominated by the ultra-Orthodox segment of the population has instituted legal barriers for those who do not practice Orthodox Judaism as Jews. However, as a nation state, Israel is very open towards other religions and religious practices, including public Muslim call to prayer chants and Christian prayer bells ringing in Jerusalem. Israel has been evaluated in research by the Pew organization as having \"high\" government restrictions on religion. The government recognizes only Orthodox Judaism in certain matters of personal status, and marriages can only be performed by religious authorities. The government provides the greatest funding to Orthodox Judaism, even though adherents represent a minority of citizens. Jewish women, including Anat Hoffman, have been arrested at the Western Wall for praying and singing while wearing religious garments the Orthodox feel should be reserved for men. Women of the Wall have organized to promote religious freedom at the Wall. In November 2014, a group of 60 non-Orthodox rabbinical students were told they would not be allowed to pray in the Knesset synagogue because it is reserved for Orthodox. Rabbi Joel Levy, director of the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, said that he had submitted the request on behalf of the students and saw their shock when the request was denied. He noted: \"paradoxically, this decision served as an appropriate end to our conversation about religion and state in Israel.\" MK Dov Lipman expressed the concern that many Knesset workers are unfamiliar with non-Orthodox and American practices and would view \"an egalitarian service in the synagogue as an affront.\" The non-Orthodox forms of Jewish practice function independently in Israel, except for these issues of praying at the Western Wall.\n\n According to the Catholic Church in the Vatican II document on religious freedom, \"Dignitatis Humanae\", \"the human person has a right to religious freedom\", which is described as \"immunity from coercion in civil society\". This principle of religious freedom \"leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion.\" In addition, this right \"is to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a civil right.\"\n\nPrior to this, Pope Pius IX had written a document called the \"Syllabus of Errors. \"The Syllabus was made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, and presented as a list of \"condemned propositions\". It does not explain why each particular proposition is wrong, but it cites earlier documents to which the reader can refer for the Pope's reasons for saying each proposition is false. Among the statements included in the Syllabus are: \"[It is an error to say that] Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true\" (15); \"[It is an error to say that] In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship\"; \"[It is an error to say that] Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship\".\n\nSome Orthodox Christians, especially those living in democratic countries, support religious freedom for all, as evidenced by the position of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Many Protestant Christian churches, including some Baptists, Churches of Christ, Seventh-day Adventist Church and main line churches have a commitment to religious freedoms. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also affirms religious freedom.\n\nHowever others, such as African scholar Makau Mutua, have argued that Christian insistence on the propagation of their faith to native cultures as an element of religious freedom has resulted in a corresponding denial of religious freedom to native traditions and led to their destruction. As he states in the book produced by the Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief, \"Imperial religions have necessarily violated individual conscience and the communal expressions of Africans and their communities by subverting African religions.\"\n\nIn their book \"Breaking India\", Rajiv Malhotra and Aravindan Neelakandan discussed the \"US Church\" funding activities in India, such as the popularly advertised campaigns to \"save\" poor children by feeding, clothing, and educating them, with the book arguing that the funds collected were being used not so much for the purposes indicated to sponsors, but for indoctrination and conversion activities. They suggest that India is the prime target of a huge enterprise a \"network\" of organizations, individuals, and churches that, they argue, seem intensely devoted to the task of creating a separatist identity, history, and even religion for the vulnerable sections of India. They suggest that this nexus of players includes not only church groups, government bodies, and related organizations, but also private think tanks and academics.\n\nJoel Spring has written about the Christianization of the Roman Empire:\n\nChristianity added new impetus to the expansion of empire. Increasing the arrogance of the imperial project, Christians insisted that the Gospels and the Church were the only valid sources of religious beliefs. Imperialists could claim that they were both civilizing the world and spreading the true religion. By the 5th century, Christianity was thought of as co-extensive with the \"Imperium romanum\". This meant that to be human, as opposed to being a natural slave, was to be \"civilized\" and Christian. Historian Anthony Pagden argues, \"just as the \"civitas\"; had now become coterminous with Christianity, so to be human to be, that is, one who was 'civil', and who was able to interpret correctly the law of nature one had now also to be Christian.\" After the fifteenth century, most Western colonialists rationalized the spread of empire with the belief that they were saving a barbaric and pagan world by spreading Christian civilization.\n\nConversion to Islam is simple, but Muslims are forbidden to convert from Islam to another religion. Certain Muslim-majority countries are known for their restrictions on religious freedom, highly favoring Muslim citizens over non-Muslim citizens. Other countries having the same restrictive laws tend to be more liberal when imposing them. Even other Muslim-majority countries are secular and thus do not regulate religious belief. \n\nIslamic theologians quote the Qur'an ( and , i.e., Sura Al-Kafirun) to show scriptural support for religious freedom.\n\n, referring to the war against Pagans during the Battle of Badr in Medina, indicates that Muslims are only allowed to fight against those who intend to harm them (right of self-defense) and that if their enemies surrender, they must also stop because God does not like those who transgress limits.\n\nIn Bukhari:V9 N316, Jabir ibn 'Abdullah narrated that a Bedouin accepted Islam and then when he got a fever he demanded that Muhammad to cancel his pledge (allow him to renounce Islam). Muhammad refused to do so. The Bedouin man repeated his demand once, but Muhammad once again refused. Then, he (the Bedouin) left Medina. Muhammad said, \"Madinah is like a pair of bellows (furnace): it expels its impurities and brightens and clear its good.\" In this narration, there was no evidence demonstrating that Muhammad ordered the execution of the Bedouin for wanting to renounce Islam.\n\nIn addition, , which is believed to be God's final revelation to Muhammad, states that Muslims are to fear God and not those who reject Islam, and states that one is accountable only for one's own actions. Therefore, it postulates that in Islam, in the matters of practising a religion, it does not relate to a worldly punishment, but rather these actions are accountable to God in the afterlife. Thus, this supports the argument against the execution of apostates in Islam.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, some Muslims support the practice of executing apostates who leave Islam, as in Bukhari:V4 B52 N260; \"The Prophet said, 'If a Muslim discards his religion and separates from the main body of Muslims, kill him.\n\nIn Iran, the constitution recognizes four religions whose status is formally protected: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nThe constitution, however, also set the groundwork for the institutionalized persecution of Bahá'ís,\nwho have been subjected to arrests, beatings, executions, confiscation and destruction of property, and the denial of civil rights and liberties, and the denial of access to higher education. There is no freedom of conscience in Iran, as converting from Islam to any other religion is forbidden.\n\nIn Egypt, a 16 December 2006 judgment of the Supreme Administrative Council created a clear demarcation between recognized religions Islam, Christianity and Judaism and all other religious beliefs; no other religious affiliation is officially admissible. The ruling leaves members of other religious communities, including Bahá'ís, without the ability to obtain the necessary government documents to have rights in their country, essentially denying them of all rights of citizenship. They cannot obtain ID cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, and passports; they also cannot be employed, educated, treated in public hospitals or vote, among other things. See Egyptian identification card controversy.\n\nAmong the most contentious areas of religious freedom is the right of an individual to change or abandon his or her own religion (apostasy), and the right to evangelize individuals seeking to convince others to make such a change.\n\nOther debates have centered around restricting certain kinds of missionary activity by religions. Many Islamic states, and others such as China, severely restrict missionary activities of other religions. Greece, among European countries, has generally looked unfavorably on missionary activities of denominations others than the majority church and proselytizing is constitutionally prohibited.\n\nA different kind of critique of the freedom to propagate religion has come from non-Abrahamic traditions such as the African and Indian. African scholar Makau Mutua criticizes religious evangelism on the ground of cultural annihilation by what he calls \"proselytizing universalist faiths\" (Chapter 28: Proselytism and Cultural Integrity, p. 652):\n\nSome Indian scholars have similarly argued that the right to propagate religion is not culturally or religiously neutral.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, there have been debates regarding a bill on religious freedom that seeks to protect indigenous religious traditions from certain kinds of missionary activities. Debates have also occurred in various states of India regarding similar laws, particularly those that restrict conversions using force, fraud or allurement.\n\nIn 2008, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a Christian human rights non-governmental organisation which specializes in religious freedom, launched an in-depth report on the human rights abuses faced by individuals who leave Islam for another religion. The report is the product of a year long research project in six different countries. It calls on Muslim nations, the international community, the UN and the international media to resolutely address the serious violations of human rights suffered by apostates.\n\nIn Islam, apostasy is called \"ridda\" (\"turning back\") and is considered to be a profound insult to God. A person born of Muslim parents that rejects Islam is called a \"\"murtad fitri\" (natural apostate), and a person that converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a \"murtad milli\"\" (apostate from the community).\n\nIn Islamic law (Sharia), the consensus view is that a male apostate must be put to death unless he suffers from a mental disorder or converted under duress, for example, due to an imminent danger of being killed. A female apostate must be either executed, according to Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni Hanafi school and by Shi'a scholars.\n\nIdeally, the one performing the execution of an apostate must be an imam. At the same time, all schools of Islamic jurisprudence agree that any Muslim can kill an apostate without punishment.\n\nHowever, while almost all scholars agree about the punishment, many disagree on the allowable time to retract the apostasy. Many scholars push this as far as allowing the apostate till he/she dies. Thus, practically making the death penalty just a theoretical statement/exercise. S. A. Rahman, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, argues that there is no indication of the death penalty for apostasy in the Qur'an.\n\nReligious practice may also conflict with secular law, creating debates on religious freedom. For instance, even though polygamy is permitted in Islam, it is prohibited in secular law in many countries. This raises the question of whether prohibiting the practice infringes on the beliefs of certain Muslims. The US and India, both constitutionally secular nations, have taken two different views of this. In India, polygamy is permitted, but only for Muslims, under Muslim Personal Law. In the US, polygamy is prohibited for all. This was a major source of conflict between the early LDS Church and the United States until the Church amended its position on practicing polygamy.\n\nSimilar issues have also arisen in the context of the religious use of psychedelic substances by Native American tribes in the United States as well as other Native practices.\n\nIn 1955, Chief Justice of California Roger J. Traynor neatly summarized the American position on how freedom of religion cannot imply freedom from law: \"Although freedom of conscience and the freedom to believe are absolute, the freedom to act is not.\" But with respect to the religious use of animals within secular law and those acts, the US Supreme Court decision in the case of the \"Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah\" in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual animal sacrifice, with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision: \"religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection\" (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in \"Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division\" ).\n\nIn 2015, Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, refused to abide by the Supreme Court decision in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" legalizing Same-sex marriage in the United States. When she refused to issue marriage licenses, she became embroiled in the \"Miller v. Davis\" lawsuit. Her actions caused attorney and author Roberta Kaplan to state that \"Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate.\"\n\nIn 1962, the case of Engele v. Vitale went to court over the violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment resulting from a mandatory nondenominational prayer in New York public schools. The Supreme Court ruled in opposition to the state. \n\nIn 1963, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Abington School District v. Schempp. Edward Schempp sued the school district in Abington over the Pennsylvania law which required students to hear and sometimes read portions of the bible for their daily education. The court ruled in favor of Schempp and the Pennsylvania law was overturned.\n\nIn 1968, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Epperson v. Arkansas. Susan Epperson, a high school teacher in Arkansas sued over a violation of religious freedom. The state had a law banning the teaching of evolution and the school Epperson worked for had provided curriculum which contained evolutionary theory. Epperson had to choose between violating the law or losing her job. The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the Arkansas law because it was unconstitutional.\n\nThe law in Germany provides the term of \"religious majority\" (\"Religiöse Mündigkeit\") with a minimum age for minors to follow their own religious beliefs even if their parents don't share those or don't approve. Children 14 and older have the unrestricted right to enter or exit any religious community. Children 12 and older cannot be compelled to change to a different belief. Children 10 and older have to be heard before their parents change their religious upbringing to a different belief. There are similar laws in Austria and in Switzerland.\n\n27 October is International Religious Freedom Day, in commemoration of the execution of the Boston martyrs, a group of Quakers executed by the Puritans on Boston Common for their religious beliefs under the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony between 1659–1661. The US proclaimed 16 January Religious Freedom Day.\n\nIn its 2011 annual report, the \"United States Commission on International Religious Freedom\" designated fourteen nations as \"countries of particular concern\". The commission chairman commented that these are nations whose conduct marks them as the world's worst religious freedom violators and human rights abusers. The fourteen nations designated were Burma, China, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Other nations on the commission's watchlist include Afghanistan, Belarus, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Laos, Russia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Venezuela.\n\nThere are concerns about the restrictions on public religious dress in some European countries (including the Hijab, Kippah, and Christian cross). Article 18 of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights limits restrictions on freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs to those necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. Freedom of religion as a legal concept is related to, but not identical with, religious toleration, separation of church and state, or secular state (\"laïcité\").\n\nThe Pew Research Center has performed studies on international religious freedom between 2009 and 2015, compiling global data from 16 governmental and non-governmental organizations–including the United Nations, the United States State Department, and Human Rights Watch–and representing over 99.5 percent of the world's population. In 2009, nearly 70 percent of the world's population lived in countries classified as having heavy restrictions on freedom of religion. This concerns restrictions on religion originating from government prohibitions on free speech and religious expression as well as social hostilities undertaken by private individuals, organisations and social groups. Social hostilities were classified by the level of communal violence and religion-related terrorism.\n\nWhile most countries provided for the protection of religious freedom in their constitutions or laws, only a quarter of those countries were found to fully respect these legal rights in practice. In 75 countries governments limit the efforts of religious groups to proselytise and in 178 countries religious groups must register with the government. In 2013, Pew classified 30% of countries as having restrictions that tend to target religious minorities, and 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.\n\nThe countries in North and South America reportedly had some of the lowest levels of \"government\" and \"social\" restrictions on religion, while The Middle East and North Africa were the regions with the highest. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran were the countries that top the list of countries with the \"overall\" highest levels of restriction on religion. Topping the Pew government restrictions index were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Egypt, Burma, Maldives, Eritrea, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\nOf the world's 25 most populous countries, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan had the most restrictions, while Brazil, Japan, Italy, South Africa, the UK, and the US had some of the lowest levels, as measured by Pew.\n\nVietnam and China were classified as having high \"government\" restrictions on religion but were in the moderate or low range when it came to \"social\" hostilities. Nigeria, Bangladesh and India were high in \"social\" hostilities but moderate in terms of \"government\" actions.\n\nRestrictions on religion across the world increased between mid-2009 and mid-2010, according to a 2012 study by the Pew Research Center. Restrictions in each of the five major regions of the world increased—including in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions where overall restrictions previously had been declining. In 2010, Egypt, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Russia, and Yemen were added to the \"very high\" category of social hostilities. The five highest social hostility scores were for Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Iraq, and Bangladesh. In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but the harassment of Jews increased.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55281799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55281799", "title": "Gapjil", "text": "Gapjil\n\nGapjil (Hangul: 갑질) refers to the arrogant and authoritarian attitude or actions of people in South Korea who have positions of power over others. Gapjil is a neologism made by combining the word Gap (갑; 甲)—which is used to introduce the first party in a contract, but also refers to a party's superior status—and jil (-질), a suffix that negatively refers to particular actions. It is a phenomenon associated with the hierarchical nature of Korean society and work culture—a structure which results in the social superiority of those with higher wealth. Various incidents, such as the nut rage, have brought this phenomenon to the attention of the world media.\n\nSong Jae-ryung, a professor of sociology at Kyunghee University, points out that Gapjil is not simply a matter of an individual's morality, but a societal problem. As the bottom of Korean society is constituted by the repressive role of Gap and submissive attitude of Eul, individuals follow the culture of the elite. In other words, the cause of gapjil is a cultural tendency for people to merely perform the roles which are shaped by the high power distance in Korea. This is why an individual who was Eul in another situation is doing the same thing (gapjil) in another relationship when he or she becomes another Gap. In order to solve the gapjil problem, Prof. Song says, each individual needs to admit the social position that is different horizontally, not vertically, and the social atmosphere that fosters this awareness needs to be formed.\n\nAccording to an article in Economic Review, a Korean magazine, there are some obvious types of gapjil depending on the context: owner gapjil, push-driven distribution gapjil, and passion-pay.\n\n'Owner gapjil' is the most common type of gapjil, where representatives or executive family members of a company treat their employees with contempt, using abusive language or even assault. Owner gapjil reflects the mistaken view that employers can treat employees however they want because of the extreme vertical relationship between the two.\n\nOn 23 December 2015, there was a report that Kim Man-sik, honorary president of Monggo Food, had used abusive language and assaulted his chauffeur 'B'. The assaulted employee said, \"President Kim indulges in violence and hurl abuses almost like a habit, if his mood is bad\". After Monggo Food posted an apology on its website on 23 December, Kim Man-sik and Kim Hyeon-seung, CEO of the firm, apologized to the public and to the person directly involved, on 25 December in a press conference. Although there had been a disagreement with victims concerning a problem of reinstatement, an amicable settlement was made with the victims of the assault. On 19 April 2016, the Masan Branch of the Changwon District Public Prosecutor's Office requested that Kim Man-sik issue a summary order of 7,000,000 won (about 6,000 dollars as of July 2018) in fines relating to habitual assaults, violence and violation of labour standards.\n\nIn October 2010, Choi Cheol-won, the CEO of M&M, called a tank truck driver—who had gone on a demonstration in front of the SK headquarters—to his office and assaulted them with such things as a baseball bat. As a result, the driver suffered injuries requiring two weeks of medical treatment. This incident was reported in the editorial program of MBC, which aired on 28 November 2010. Huge amounts of public criticism, particularly resulting from a memorandum that had been written to certify that the driver was given 20,000,000 won (about 20,000 dollars as of July 2018) as compensation for the violence. After Choi Cheol-won had been charged on 30 November, the police started to investigate the scandal. On 8 February 2011, the Seoul Central District Court sentenced him to 18 months in prison and the appellate tribunal sentenced him to 18 months in prison with three years of probation and 120 hours of community service. The judgement of the court's decision saying, \"Social criticism is a reason for the sentence\" caused controversy.\n\nWhen Korean Air executive ‘Cho Hyun-min’ allegedly sprayed water on company's employees, foreign media paid attention. In March 2018, the allegations of yelling and spraying water to an advertising agent caused rising controversy. When concerns over Cho's behavior became widespread, Korean Air explained, “It is true that during the meeting, the water rose and splashed when the bucket fell on the floor, but it did not spray water on the staff”. Cho apologized for her behavior. This incident caused many foreign media to start using the word \"gapjil\" directly.\n\n'Push-driven distribution gapjil' is a type of gapjil where large corporations make pressing delivery (or supply) demands to small businesses (franchises).\n\nIn May 2013, Namyang Co. was criticised following an accusation that the firm had pressed local franchises to buy products for a long time, as well as a tape-recording of rough words to local owners. Namyang Co. caused more than 20 billion wons' worth (about 18 million dollars as of July 2018) of damage through illegal activities—such as high-pressure sales and shifting wages of salesmen to local franchises—for the past seven years, for which the Seoul Central District Court convicted it in January 2014. With this case, the chronic gapjil problem in Korean society became a public social issue. There was also a boycott against Namyang Corporation.\n\nIn September 2017, Hyundai Mobis was suspected of pressure to achieve sales goals and forced sales by 1600 branches of local maintenance shops from January 2010 to November 2013. The manager of the local shops was pressed to buy unnecessary parts of an automobile under the name of \"Random Sales\" and \"Negotiated Sales\" in order to achieve the goal of the head office. Hyundai Mobis admitted carrying out these acts and since then has been establishing a plan to ensure they do not reoccur.\n\nPassion-pay is a type of labour extortion where the corporation pays less than minimum wage, or even nothing, for the labor of young job seekers who have trouble finding a job.\n\nIn January 2015, Lie Sang Bong design studio, which is managed by Korean fashion designer Lie Sang Bong, was embroiled in controversy about passion-pay. Although the studio imposed excessive workloads on workers, the studio offered relatively low wages: 100,000 won (about 100 dollars as of July 2018) for apprentices, 300,000 won (about 300 dollars) for interns and 1,100,000 won (about 1,100 dollars) for regular workers. After the controversy, Lie Sang Bong said \"I deeply apologized to the youths of the fashion industry who get hurt with working environment and treatment, and I'll try to improve the overall problem of the fashion industry in this opportunity\".\n\nIn September 2017, Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) was in a controversy because it did passion-pay on newly graduated nurses for five years since 2012, for \"probationary education period\". It turned out that SNUH only paid 360,000 won (about 360 dollars as of July 2018) for 24 days work to 1,212 nurses in their period of education. Based on an eight hour working day, the sum of 360,000 won is equivalent to an hourly rate of 1,800 won (about 2 dollars), which is far below the minimum wage of 6,470 won (about 6 dollars). The hospital explained that they did not know whether they should pay full wages during the training session. In addition, they plan to provide retroactive payment to nurses under three years, which is a period appointed by the recent labor standard law.\n\nBoycott can be defined as a movement of consumers' refusal to buy a particular item in order to accomplish a specific purpose.\n\nUnlike gapjil (which is a structural problem between 'Gap' and 'Eul', like the franchise-maker and the retailer), the boycott campaign showed that it can explode instantly when the problem touches consumer's feelings. This is because consumers think that not consuming products of gapjil firms is the best thing they can do. This movement suggests that the gapjil of company owners or executives is becoming a 'self-harm' activity which decreases corporate profits. Experts emphasize that in order to reduce corporate ethical problems, such as gapjil, consumers need to change their perception as a consumer in a larger frame of mind. Corporations will be changed when consumer involvement such as resentment at gapjil and boycott is increased. A consumer movement group staged boycott campaigns and received favourable responses from consumers, but there has not yet been a massive and organised boycott.\n\nOn 11 April 2016, the Korean civil society organisation Public Welfare Committee (PWC) opened a 24-hour call centre for reporting gapjil damages and behavior. It is operated for rooting out irregular practices. PWC explained that the purpose of the call center was to prevent gapjil behavior, which is prevalent in South Korean society, and to conduct criminal and civil measures through case verification.\n\nAfter Kim Sang-jo was inaugurated as chairperson of the Korean Fair Trade Commission (FTC), the FTC started an investigation of all industrial head offices and franchises to resolve all gapjil cases in four major areas: distribution, affiliate, subcontract, and franchise.\n\nBeginning 10 August 2017, the FTC began investigating the transactions between headquarters and agencies, which targeted about 4,800 headquarters, 70 franchises and group of franchises of all domestic industry. The investigation was conducted as a survey targeting the headquarters between August and September, and since then targeted the franchises and groups of franchises from September to December. The FTC said the purpose of the investigation was to secure basic data to prevent unfair trade practices between headquarters and franchises, in order to prepare policies and improve the system.\n\nIn July 2017, the FTC established an ombudsman for permanent surveillance of protection measures about franchises. The ombudsman was organised with former and current merchants with experience in franchise trading and 13 members of the FTC. They planned to expand the members to 30, including wholesale, retail, and service sectors. The ombudsman regularly monitors trading practices in franchise sectors and reports to the FTC when signs of unfair trade are detected. In addition, they state their opinion in policy enforcement, and they suggest ideas to improve the system by collecting problems information on the field.\n\nFor the first time in local government, the Seoul Metropolitan Government started to eradicate unfair practices in the franchise industry, declaring, \"2016 economic democratisation city, Seoul\". The Seoul Metropolitan Government has operated an unfair damage counselling centre, where anyone who suffered from unfair damages can report their case through the member's office.\n\nNot only the franchiser who is operating the franchise but also an ex-franchiser and even a group of franchisers can report and gather unfair cases of members. When the report is received, first, the government identifies the exact facts of the incident through an in-depth consultation with the franchiser who reported the incident, then meeting with a group of franchisers. According to the issue, the government recommends to the headquarters of the franchise a voluntary corrective action or handles arrangements. Depending on the degree of violation of the law, the investigation request to the FTC or the prosecution are reviewed.\n\nIn December 2014, the nut rage incident was covered by numerous international media, and gapjil reached a level of global prominence. In February 2015, the Reuters news agency reported about Korean gapjil culture and the judgement of the nut rage incident. According to the article, it seemed that Korean gapjil culture originates from a traditional vertical hierarchy in Korean society. In May 2015, \"The Independent\", British newspaper, reported on the No-Look Pass issue of Korean politician Kim Moo-sung, and pointed out that most gapjil is done by Korean adult men, especially middle aged men.\n\n"}
{"id": "474880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=474880", "title": "Hawthorne effect", "text": "Hawthorne effect\n\nThe Hawthorne effect (also referred to as the observer effect) is a type of reactivity in which individuals modify an aspect of their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed. The original research at the Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois, on lighting changes and work structure changes such as working hours and break times was originally interpreted by Elton Mayo and others to mean that paying attention to overall worker needs would improve productivity. Later interpretations such as that done by Landsberger suggested that the novelty of being research subjects and the increased attention from such could lead to temporary increases in workers' productivity. This interpretation was dubbed \"the Hawthorne effect\".\n\nThe term was coined in 1958 by Henry A. Landsberger when he was analyzing earlier experiments from 1924–32 at the Hawthorne Works (a Western Electric factory outside Chicago). The Hawthorne Works had commissioned a study to see if its workers would become more productive in higher or lower levels of light. The workers' productivity seemed to improve when changes were made, and slumped when the study ended. It was suggested that the productivity gain occurred as a result of the motivational effect on the workers of the interest being shown in them.\n\nThis effect was observed for minute increases in illumination. In these lighting studies, light intensity was altered to examine its effect on worker productivity. Most industrial/occupational psychology and organizational behavior textbooks refer to the illumination studies. Only occasionally are the rest of the studies mentioned.\n\nAlthough illumination research of workplace lighting formed the basis of the Hawthorne effect, other changes such as maintaining clean work stations, clearing floors of obstacles, and even relocating workstations resulted in increased productivity for short periods. Thus the term is used to identify any type of short-lived increase in productivity.\nIn one of the studies, researchers chose two women as test subjects and asked them to choose four other workers to join the test group. Together the women worked in a separate room over the course of five years (1927–1932) assembling telephone relays.\n\nOutput was measured mechanically by counting how many finished relays each worker dropped down a chute. This measuring began in secret two weeks before moving the women to an experiment room and continued throughout the study. In the experiment room they had a supervisor who discussed changes with their productivity. Some of the variables were:\n\n\nChanging a variable usually increased productivity, even if the variable was just a change back to the original condition. However it is said that this is the natural process of the human being adapting to the environment, without knowing the objective of the experiment occurring. Researchers concluded that the workers worked harder because they thought that they were being monitored individually.\n\nResearchers hypothesized that choosing one's own coworkers, working as a group, being treated as special (as evidenced by working in a separate room), and having a sympathetic supervisor were the real reasons for the productivity increase. One interpretation, mainly due to Elton Mayo, was that \"the six individuals became a team and the team gave itself wholeheartedly and spontaneously to cooperation in the experiment.\" (There was a second relay assembly test room study whose results were not as significant as the first experiment.)\n\nThe purpose of the next study was to find out how payment incentives would affect productivity. The surprising result was that productivity actually decreased. Workers apparently had become suspicious that their productivity may have been boosted to justify firing some of the workers later on. The study was conducted by Elton Mayo and W. Lloyd Warner between 1931 and 1932 on a group of fourteen men who put together telephone switching equipment. The researchers found that although the workers were paid according to individual productivity, productivity decreased because the men were afraid that the company would lower the base rate. Detailed observation of the men revealed the existence of informal groups or \"cliques\" within the formal groups. These cliques developed informal rules of behavior as well as mechanisms to enforce them. The cliques served to control group members and to manage bosses; when bosses asked questions, clique members gave the same responses, even if they were untrue. These results show that workers were more responsive to the social force of their peer groups than to the control and incentives of management.\n\nRichard Nisbett has described the Hawthorne effect as \"a glorified anecdote\", saying that \"once you have got the anecdote, you can throw away the data.\" Other researchers have attempted to explain the effects with various interpretations.\n\nAdair warns of gross factual inaccuracy in most secondary publications on Hawthorne effect and that many studies failed to find it. He argues that it should be viewed as a variant of Orne's (1973) experimental demand effect. So for Adair, the issue is that an experimental effect depends on the participants' interpretation of the situation; this is why manipulation checks are important in social sciences experiments. So he thinks it is not awareness \"per se\", nor special attention \"per se\", but participants' interpretation that must be investigated in order to discover if/how the experimental conditions interact with the participants' goals. This can affect whether participants believe something, if they act on it or do not see it as in their interest, etc.\n\nPossible explanations for the Hawthorne effect include the impact of feedback and motivation towards the experimenter. Receiving feedback on their performance may improve their skills when an experiment provides this feedback for the first time. Research on the demand effect also suggests that people may be motivated to please the experimenter, at least if it does not conflict with any other motive. They may also be suspicious of the purpose of the experimenter. Therefore, Hawthorne effect may only occur when there is usable feedback or a change in motivation.\n\nParsons defines the Hawthorne effect as \"the confounding that occurs if experimenters fail to realize how the consequences of subjects' performance affect what subjects do\" [i.e. learning effects, both permanent skill improvement and feedback-enabled adjustments to suit current goals]. His key argument is that in the studies where workers dropped their finished goods down chutes, the participants had access to the counters of their work rate.\n\nMayo contended that the effect was due to the workers reacting to the sympathy and interest of the observers. He does say that this experiment is about testing overall effect, not testing factors separately. He also discusses it not really as an experimenter effect but as a management effect: how management can make workers perform differently because they feel differently. A lot to do with feeling free, not feeling supervised but more in control as a group. The experimental manipulations were important in convincing the workers to feel this way: that conditions were really different. The experiment was repeated with similar effects on mica-splitting workers.\n\nClark and Sugrue in a review of educational research say that uncontrolled novelty effects cause on average 30% of a standard deviation (SD) rise (i.e. 50%–63% score rise), which decays to small level after 8 weeks. In more detail: 50% of a SD for up to 4 weeks; 30% of SD for 5–8 weeks; and 20% of SD for > 8 weeks, (which is < 1% of the variance).\n\nHarry Braverman points out that the Hawthorne tests were based on industrial psychology and were investigating whether workers' performance could be predicted by pre-hire testing. The Hawthorne study showed \"that the performance of workers had little relation to ability and in fact often bore an inverse relation to test scores...\". Braverman argues that the studies really showed that the workplace was not \"a system of bureaucratic formal organisation on the Weberian model, nor a system of informal group relations, as in the interpretation of Mayo and his followers but rather a system of power, of class antagonisms\". This discovery was a blow to those hoping to apply the behavioral sciences to manipulate workers in the interest of management.\n\nThe economists Steven Levitt and John A. List long pursued without success a search for the base data of the original illumination experiments, before finding it in a microfilm at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee in 2011. Re-analysing it, they found slight evidence for the Hawthorn effect over the long-run, but in no way as drastic as suggested initially This finding supported the analysis of an article by S R G Jones in 1992 examining the relay experiments. Despite the absence of evidence for the Hawthorne Effect in the original study, List has said that he remains confident that the effect is genuine.\n\nIt is also possible that the illumination experiments can be explained by a longitudinal learning effect. Parsons has declined to analyse the illumination experiments, on the grounds that they have not been properly published and so he cannot get at details, whereas he had extensive personal communication with Roethlisberger and Dickson.\n\nEvaluation of the Hawthorne effect continues in the present day.\n\nVarious medical scientists have studied possible trial effect (clinical trial effect) in clinical trials. Some postulate that, beyond just attention and observation, there may be other factors involved, such as slightly better care; slightly better compliance/adherence; and selection bias. The latter may have several mechanisms: (1) Physicians may tend to recruit patients who seem to have better adherence potential and lesser likelihood of future loss to follow-up. (2) The inclusion/exclusion criteria of trials often exclude at least some comorbidities; although this is often necessary to prevent confounding, it also means that trials may tend to work with healthier patient subpopulations.\n\nDespite the observer effect as popularized in the Hawthorne experiments being perhaps falsely identified (see above discussion), the popularity and plausibility of the observer effect in theory has led researchers to postulate that this effect could take place at a second level. Thus it has been proposed that there is a secondary observer effect when researchers working with secondary data such as survey data or various indicators may impact the results of their scientific research. Rather than having an effect on the subjects (as with the primary observer effect), the researchers likely have their own idiosyncrasies that influence how they handle the data and even what data they obtain from secondary sources. For one, the researchers may choose seemingly innocuous steps in their statistical analyses that end up causing significantly different results using the same data; e.g., weighting strategies, factor analytic techniques, or choice of estimation. In addition, researchers may use software packages that have different default settings that lead to small but significant fluctuations. Finally, the data that researchers use may not be identical, even though it seems so. For example, the OECD collects and distributes various socio-economic data; however, these data change over time such that a researcher who downloads the Australian GDP data for the year 2000 may have slightly different values than a researcher who downloads the same Australian GDP 2000 data a few years later. The idea of the secondary observer effect was floated by Nate Breznau in a thus far relatively obscure paper.\n\nAlthough little attention has been paid to this phenomenon, the scientific implications are very large. Evidence of this effect may be seen in recent studies that assign a particular problem to a number of researchers or research teams who then work independently using the same data to try and find a solution. This is a process called crowdsourcing data analysis and was used in a groundbreaking study by Silberzahn, Rafael, Eric Uhlmann, Dan Martin and Brian Nosek et al. (2015) about red cards and player race in football (i.e., soccer).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52966974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52966974", "title": "In situ bioremediation", "text": "In situ bioremediation\n\nBioremediation is the process of decontaminating polluted sites through the usage of either endogenous or external microorganism. In situ is a term utilized within a variety of fields meaning \"on site\" and refers to the location of an event. Within the context of bioremediation, in situ indicates that the location of the bioremediation has occurred at the site of contamination without the translocation of the polluted materials. Bioremediation is used to neutralize pollutants including Hydrocarbons, chlorinated compounds, nitrates, toxic metals and other pollutants through a variety of chemical mechanisms. Microorganism used in the process of bioremediation can either be implanted or cultivated within the site through the application of fertilizers and other nutrients. Common polluted sites targeted by bioremediation are groundwater/aquifers and polluted soils. Aquatic ecosystems affected by oil spills have also shown improvement through the application of bioremediation. The most notable cases being the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. Two variations of bioremediation exist defined by the location where the process occurs. Ex situ bioremediation occurs at a location separate from the contaminated site and involves the translocation of the contaminated material. In situ occurs within the site of contamination In situ bioremediation can further be categorized by the metabolism occurring, aerobic and anaerobic, and by the level of human involvement.\nThe Sun Oil pipeline spill in Ambler, Pennsylvania spurred the first commercial usage of in situ bioremediation in 1972 to remove hydrocarbons from contaminated sites. A patent was filed in 1974 by Richard Raymond, Reclamation of Hydrocarbon Contaminated Ground Waters, which provided the basis for the commercialization of in situ bioremediation.\n\nAccelerated in situ bioremediation is defined when a specified microorganism is targeted for growth through the application of either nutrients or an electron donor to the contaminated site. Within aerobic metabolism the nutrient added to the soil can be solely Oxygen. Anaerobic in situ bioremediation often requires a variety of electron donors or acceptors such as benzoate and lactate. Besides nutrients, microorganisms can also be introduced directly to the site within accelerated in situ bioremediation. The addition of extraneous microorganisms to a site is termed bioaugmentation and is used when a particular microorganism is effective at degrading the pollutant at the site and is not found either naturally or at a high enough population to be effective. Accelerated in situ bioremediation is utilized when the desired population of microorganisms within a site is not naturally present at a sufficient level to effectively degrade the pollutants. It also is used when the required nutrients within the site are either not at a concentration sufficient to support growth or are unavailable.\n\nThe Raymond Process is a type of accelerated in situ bioremediation that was developed by Richard Raymond and involves the introduction of nutrients and electron acceptors to a contaminated site. This process is primarily used to treat polluted groundwater. In the Raymond process a loop system is created. Contaminated Groundwater from downstream of the groundwater flow is pumped to the surface and infused with nutrients and an electron donor, often oxygen. This treated water is then pumped back down below the water table upstream of where it was originally taken. This process introduces nutrients and electron donors into the site allowing for the growth of a determined microbial population.\n\nIn contaminated sites where the desired microbial metabolism is aerobic the introduction of oxygen to the site can be used to increase the population of targeted microorganisms. The injection of Oxygen can occur through a variety of processes. Oxygen can be injected into the subsurface through injection wells. It can also be introduced through an injection gallery. The presence of oxygen within a site is often the limiting factor when determining the time frame and efficacy of a proposed in situ bioremediation process.\n\nOzone injected into the subsurface can also be a means of introducing oxygen into a contaminated site. Despite being a strong oxidizing agent and potentially having a toxic effect on subsurface microbial populations, ozone can be an efficient means of spreading oxygen throughout a site due to its high solubility. Within twenty minutes after being injected into the subsurface, fifty percent of the ozone will have decomposed to Oxygen. Ozone is commonly introduced to the soil in either a dissolved or gaseous state.\n\nWithin accelerated anaerobic in situ bioremediation electron donors and acceptors are introduced into a contaminated site in order to increase the population of anaerobic microorganisms.\n\nMonitored Natural Attenuation is in situ bioremediation that occurs with little to no human intervention. This process relies on the natural microbial populations sustained within the contaminated sites to over time reduce the contaminants to a desired level. During monitored natural attenuation the site is monitored in order to track the progress of the bioremediation. Monitored natural attenuation is used in sites where the source of contamination is no longer present, often after other more active types of in situ bioremediation have been conducted.\n\nNaturally occurring within the soil are microbial populations that utilize hydrocarbons as a source of energy and Carbon. Upwards to twenty percent of microbial soil populations have the ability to metabolize hydrocarbons. These populations can through either accelerated or natural monitored attenuation be utilized to neutralize within the soil hydrocarbon pollutants. The metabolic mode of hydrocarbon remediation is primarily aerobic. The end products of the remediation for hydrocarbons are Carbon Dioxide and water. Hydrocarbons vary in ease of degradation based on their structure. Long chain aliphatic carbons are the most effectively degraded. Short chained, branched, and quaternary aliphatic hydrocarbons are less effectively degraded. Alkene degradation is dependent on the saturation of the chain with saturated alkenes being more readily degraded. Large numbers of microbes with the ability to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons are present within the soil. Aromatic hydrocarbons are also susceptible to being degraded through anaerobic metabolism. Hydrocarbon metabolism is an important facet of in situ bioremediation due to the severity of petroleum spills around the world. Polynuclear aromatic carbons susceptibility to degradation is related to the number of aromatic rings within the compound. Compounds with two or three rings are degraded at an effective rate, compounds possessing four or more rings can be more resilient to bioremediation efforts. Degradation of polynuclear aromatic carbons with less than four rings is accomplished by various aerobic microbes present in the soil. For larger compounds the only metabolic mode that has shown to be effective is cometabolism. The fungus genus Phanerochaete under anaerobic conditions has species with the ability to metabolize some polynuclear aromatic carbons utilizing a peroxidase enzyme.\n\nA variety of metabolic modes exist capable of degrading chlorinated aliphatic compounds. Anaerobic reduction, oxidation of the compound, and cometabolism under aerobic conditions are the three main metabolic modes utilized by microorganisms to degrade chlorinated aliphatic compounds. Organisms that can readily metabolize chlorinated aliphatic compounds are not common in the environment. One and two carbons that have little chlorination are the compounds most effectively metabolized by soil microbial populations. The degradation of chlorinated aliphatic compounds is most often performed through cometabolism. \n\nChlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons are resistant to bioremediation and many microorganisms lack the ability to degrade the compounds. Chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons are most often degraded through a process of reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are primarily degraded through cometabolism. There are also some fungi that can degrade the compounds as well. Studies show an increase in PCB degradation when biphenyl is added to the site due to cometabolic affects the enzymes used to degrade biphenyl have on PCBs.\n\nDue to in situ bioremediation taking place at the site of contamination there is a lessened risk of cross contamination as opposed to ex situ bioremediation where the polluted material is transported to other sites. In situ bioremediation can also have lower costs and a higher rate of decontamination than ex situ bioremediation.\n"}

The feature serves a role similar to data structures in a programming language and allows a type theory to add concepts like numbers, relations, and trees. As the name suggests, inductive types can be self-referential, but usually only in a way that permits structural recursion.\n\nThe standard example is encoding the natural numbers using Peano's encoding.\n\nHere, a natural number is created either from the constant \"0\" or by applying the function \"S\" to another natural number. \"S\" is the successor function which represents adding 1 to a number. Thus, \"0\" is zero, \"S 0\" is one, \"S (S 0)\" is two, \"S (S (S 0))\" is three, and so on.\n\nSince their introduction, inductive types have been extended to encode more and more structures, while still being predicative and supporting structural recursion.\n\nInductive types usually come with a function to prove properties about them. Thus, \"nat\" may come with:\n\nThis is the expected function for structural recursion for the type \"nat\".\n\nW-types are well-founded types in intuitionistic type theory (ITT). They generalize natural numbers, lists, binary trees, and other \"tree-shaped\" data types. Let be a universe of types. Given a type : and a dependent family : → , one can form a W-type formula_1. The type may be thought of as \"labels\" for the (potentially infinitely many) constructors of the inductive type being defined, whereas indicates the (potentially infinite) arity of each constructor. W-types (resp. M-types) may also be understood as well-founded (resp. non-well-founded) trees with nodes labeled by elements : and where the node labeled by has ()-many subtrees.\n\nLet 0, 1, 2, etc. be finite types with inhabitants 1 : 1, 1, 2:2, etc. One may define the natural numbers as the W-type\n\nwith : 2 → is defined by (1) = 0 (representing the constructor for zero, which takes no arguments), and (2) = 1 (representing the successor function, which takes one argument).\n\nOne may define lists over a type : as formula_3 where\nand 1 is the sole inhabitant of 1. The value of formula_5 corresponds to the constructor for the empty list, whereas the value of formula_6 corresponds to the constructor that appends to the beginning of another list.\n\nThe constructor for elements of a generic W-type formula_1 has type\nWe can also write this rule in the style of a natural deduction proof,\n\nThe elimination rule for W-types works similarly to structural induction on trees. If, whenever a property (under the propositions-as-types interpretation) : → holds for all subtrees of a given tree it also holds for that tree, then it holds for all trees.\n\nIn extensional type theories, W-types (resp. M-types) can be defined up to isomorphism as initial algebras (resp. final coalgebras) for polynomial functors. In this case, the property of initiality (res. finality) corresponds directly to the appropriate induction principle. In intensional type theories with the univalence axiom, this correspondence holds up to homotopy (propositional equality).\n\nM-types are dual to W-types, they represent coinductive (potentially infinite) data such as streams. M-types can be derived from W-types.\n\nThis technique allows \"some\" definitions of multiple types that depend on each other. For example, defining two parity predicates on natural numbers using two mutually inductive types in Coq:\n\nInduction-recursion started as a study into the limits of ITT. Once found, the limits were turned into rules that allowed defining new inductive types. These types could depend upon a function and the function on the type, as long as both were defined simultaneously.\n\nUniverse types can be defined using induction-recursion.\n\nInduction-induction allows definition of a type and a family of types at the same time. So, a type and a family of types formula_11.\n\nThis is a current research area in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT). HoTT differs from ITT by its identity type (equality). Higher inductive types not only define a new type with constants and functions that create the type, but also new instances of the identity type that relate them.\n\nA simple example is the type, which is defined with two constructors, a basepoint;\n\nand a loop;\n\nThe existence of a new constructor for the identity type makes a higher inductive type.\n\n\n\n"}

The Holy See and several predominantly Islamic nations were staunch critics, and U.S. President Bill Clinton received considerable criticism from conservatives for his participation, considering the fact that president Ronald Reagan did not attend or fund the previous conference held in Mexico City in 1984. The official spokesman for the Holy See was archbishop Renato Martino.\n\nAccording to the official ICPD release, the conference delegates achieved consensus on the following four qualitative and quantitative goals:\n\nDuring and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term 'reproductive health' in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference. \nFor the European Union, where legislation on abortion is less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the Council's commitment to promote 'reproductive health' did not include the promotion of abortion. Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified:\n\n\"The term 'reproductive health' was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of 'reproductive health' to that given in the Programme of Action, which makes no reference to abortion.\"\nWith regard to the US, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the US delegation, Vice President Al Gore, had stated for the record:\n\"Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning.\"\nSome years later, the position of the US Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by US Ambassador to the UN, Ellen Sauerbrey, when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that: \n\"nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion\". She added: \"There is no fundamental right to abortion. And yet it keeps coming up largely driven by NGOs trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition\".\n\n\n"}

J. Hobsbawm and T. O. Ranger. In their Introduction the editors argue that many \"traditions\" which \"appear or claim to be old are often quite recent in origin and sometimes invented.\" They distinguish the \"invention\" of traditions in this sense from \"starting\" or \"initiating\" a tradition which does not then claim to be old. The phenomenon is particularly clear in the modern development of the nation and of nationalism, creating a national identity promoting national unity, and legitimising certain institutions or cultural practices.\n\nThe concept and the term have been widely applied to cultural phenomena such as the Bible and Zionism, the martial arts of Japan, the \"highland myth\" in Scotland, and the traditions of major religions, to mention only a few. The concept was influential on the use of related concepts, such as Benedict Anderson's imagined communities and the pizza effect.\n\nOne implication of the term is that the sharp distinction between \"tradition\" and \"modernity\" is often itself invented. The concept is \"highly relevant to that comparatively recent historical innovation, the 'nation,' with its associated phenomena: nationalism, the nation-state, national symbols, histories, and the rest.\" Hobsbawm and Ranger remark on the \"curious but understandable paradox: modern nations and all their impedimenta generally claim to be the opposite of novel, namely rooted in remotest antiquity, and the opposite of constructed, namely human communities so 'natural' as to require no definition other than self-assertion.\" Another implication is that the concept of \"authenticity\" is also to be questioned.\n\nOne reviewer noted that the \"'invention of tradition' is a splendidly subversive phrase,\" but it \"hides serious ambiguities.\" Hobsbawm \"contrasts invented traditions with what he calls 'the strength and adaptability of genuine traditions.' But where does his 'adaptability', or his colleague Ranger's 'flexibility' end, and invention begin? Given that all traditions change, is it possible or useful to attempt to discriminate the 'genuine' antiques from the fakes?\" Another also praised the high quality of the articles but had qualifications. \"Such distinctions\" (between invented and authentic traditions) \"resolve themselves ultimately into one between the genuine and the spurious, a distinction that may be untenable because all traditions (like all symbolic phenomena) are humanly created (\"spurious\") rather than naturally given (\"genuine\").\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1058693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1058693", "title": "Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development", "text": "Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development\n\nLawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Kohlberg began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the University of Chicago in 1958 and expanded upon the theory throughout his life.\n\nThe theory holds that moral reasoning, the basis for ethical behavior, has six identifiable developmental stages, each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor. Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget, who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages. Expanding on Piaget's work, Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime, a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.\n\nThe six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels of morality: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional morality.\n\nFor his studies, Kohlberg relied on stories such as the Heinz dilemma, and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas. He then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion, and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages.\n\nThere have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives. Arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values, such as caring; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly \"post hoc\" rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists) of essentially intuitive decisions.\n\nNevertheless, an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of Kohlberg's theory, and according to Haggbloom et al.'s study of the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, Kohlberg was the 16th most frequently cited in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century, as well as the 30th most eminent overall.\n\nKohlberg's scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.\n\nKohlberg's six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional. Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in his theory of cognitive development, it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities. Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.\n\nThe understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages, but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic, lacking in sufficient attention to detail.\n\nThe pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.\n\nIn Stage one (obedience and punishment driven), individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. \"The last time I did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again.\" The worse the punishment for the act is, the more \"bad\" the act is perceived to be. This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is \"egocentric\", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own. There is \"deference to superior power or prestige\".\n\nAn example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.\n\nStage two (self-interest driven) expresses the \"what's in it for me\" position, in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a \"You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours\" mentality. The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level is quite different from the social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world's perspective is often seen as morally relative.\n\nAn example of self-interest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore. The child asks, \"what's in it for me?\" The parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores. The child is motivated by self-interest to do chores.\n\nThe conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.\n\nIn Stage three (good intentions as determined by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They try to be a \"good boy\" or \"good girl\" to live up to these expectations, having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the \"golden rule\". \"I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me.\" Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that \"they mean well\".\n\nIn Stage four (authority and social order obedience driven), it is important to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.\n\nThe post-conventional level, also known as the principled level, is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual's own perspective may take precedence over society's view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.\n\nSome theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning.\n\nIn Stage five (social contract driven), the world is viewed as holding different opinions, rights, and values. Such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community. Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts. Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet \"the greatest good for the greatest number of people\". This is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise. Democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning.\n\nIn Stage six (universal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another's shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level. Touro College Researcher Arthur P. Sullivan helped support the accuracy of Kohlberg's first five stages through data analysis, but could not provide statistical evidence for the existence of Kohlberg's sixth stage. Therefore, it is difficult to define/recognize as a concrete stage in moral development.\n\nIn his empirical studies of individuals throughout their life, Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression. This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory. Kohlberg chose the latter, postulating the existence of sub-stages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality. In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4½ or 4+, a transition from stage four to five, that shared characteristics of both. In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable. This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two, as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong. Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college.\n\nKohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning. Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage, however, led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage.\n\nKohlberg's stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative, capable of reason, and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them. The stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral \"reasonings\" adopted by individuals, and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individual's actions or character. Arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions, Kohlberg insists that the \"form and structure\" of moral arguments is independent of the \"content\" of those arguments, a position he calls \"formalism\".\n\nKohlberg's theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia.\n\nKohlberg's theory understands values as a critical component of the right. Whatever the right is, for Kohlberg, it must be universally valid across societies (a position known as \"moral universalism\"): there can be no relativism. Moreover, morals are not natural features of the world; they are prescriptive. Nevertheless, moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity.\n\nAccording to Kohlberg, someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.\n\nProgress through Kohlberg's stages happens as a result of the individual's increasing competence, both psychologically and in balancing conflicting social-value claims. The process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called \"justice operation\". Kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations: \"equality\", which involves an impartial regard for persons, and \"reciprocity\", which means a regard for the role of personal merit. For Kohlberg, the most adequate result of both operations is \"reversibility\", in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation (also known colloquially as \"moral musical chairs\").\n\nKnowledge and learning contribute to moral development. Specifically important are the individual's \"view of persons\" and their \"social perspective level\", each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage. The \"view of persons\" can be understood as the individual's grasp of the psychology of other persons; it may be pictured as a spectrum, with stage one having no view of other persons at all, and stage six being entirely socio-centric. Similarly, the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe, differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms.\n\nKohlberg established the \"Moral Judgement Interview\" in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.\n\nA dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the druggist's dilemma: \"Heinz Steals the Drug In Europe\".\n\nOne criticism of Kohlberg's theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely to move on to the abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.\n\nKohlberg's stages are not culturally neutral, as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures. Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates. Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.<ref name=\"kohlberg/gilligan\"></ref>\n\nAnother criticism of Kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e. stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e. stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.\n\nOther psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered \"post hoc\" rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.\n\nKohlberg's body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field. One example is the \"Defining Issues Test\" (\"DIT\") created in 1979 by James Rest, originally as a pencil-and-paper alternative to the Moral Judgement Interview. Heavily influenced by the six-stage model, it made efforts to improve the validity criteria by using a quantitative test, the Likert scale, to rate moral dilemmas similar to Kohlberg's. It also used a large body of Kohlbergian theory such as the idea of \"post-conventional thinking\". In 1999 the \"DIT\" was revised as the \"DIT-2\"; the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required, such as divinity, politics, and medicine.\n\n\n"}

In the four biggest ratios, the poorer country is either Yemen or North Korea.\nDue to lack of economic data, the Vatican City (which is surrounded by Italy), Saint Martin (which shares the island of Saint Martin with Sint Maarten) and the British Overseas Territories of Akrotiri and Dhekelia located in the island of Cyprus, are not included in this list.\n\n"}
{"id": "1664427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1664427", "title": "Mereotopology", "text": "Mereotopology\n\nIn formal ontology, a branch of metaphysics, and in ontological computer science, mereotopology is a first-order theory, embodying mereological and topological concepts, of the relations among wholes, parts, parts of parts, and the boundaries between parts. \n\nMereotopology begins in philosophy with theories articulated by A. N. Whitehead in several books and articles he published between 1916 and 1929, drawing in part on the mereogeometry of De Laguna (1922). The first to have proposed the idea of a point-free definition of the concept of topological space in mathematics was Karl Menger in his book \"Dimensionstheorie\" (1928) -- see also his (1940). The early historical background of mereotopology is documented in Bélanger and Marquis (2013) and Whitehead's early work is discussed in Kneebone (1963: chpt. 13.5) and Simons (1987: 2.9.1). The theory of Whitehead's 1929 \"Process and Reality\" augmented the part-whole relation with topological notions such as contiguity and connection. Despite Whitehead's acumen as a mathematician, his theories were insufficiently formal, even flawed. By showing how Whitehead's theories could be fully formalized and repaired, Clarke (1981, 1985) founded contemporary mereotopology. The theories of Clarke and Whitehead are discussed in Simons (1987: 2.10.2), and Lucas (2000: chpt. 10). The entry Whitehead's point-free geometry includes two contemporary treatments of Whitehead's theories, due to Giangiacomo Gerla, each different from the theory set out in the next section.\n\nAlthough mereotopology is a mathematical theory, we owe its subsequent development to logicians and theoretical computer scientists. Lucas (2000: chpt. 10) and Casati and Varzi (1999: chpts. 4,5) are introductions to mereotopology that can be read by anyone having done a course in first-order logic. More advanced treatments of mereotopology include Cohn and Varzi (2003) and, for the mathematically sophisticated, Roeper (1997). For a mathematical treatment of point-free geometry, see Gerla (1995). Lattice-theoretic (algebraic) treatments of mereotopology as contact algebras have been applied to separate the topological from the mereological structure, see Stell (2000), Düntsch and Winter (2004).\n\nBarry Smith (1996), Anthony Cohn, Achille Varzi and their co-authors have shown that mereotopology can be useful in formal ontology and computer science, by allowing the formalization of relations such as contact, connection, boundaries, interiors, holes, and so on. Mereotopology has been applied also as a tool for qualitative spatial-temporal reasoning, with constraint calculi such as the Region Connection Calculus (RCC). It provides the starting point for the theory of fiat boundaries developed by Smith and Varzi (2000), which grew out of the attempt to distinguish formally between \nMereotopology is being applied by Salustri in the domain of digital manufacturing (Salustri, 2002) and by Smith and Varzi to the formalization of basic notions of ecology and environmental biology (Smith and Varzi, 1999, 2002). It has been applied also to deal with vague boundaries in geography (Smith and Mark, 2003), in ecological psychology (Smith, 2000), and in the study of vagueness and granularity (Smith and Brogaard, 2002, Bittner and Smith, 2001, 2001a).\n\nCasati and Varzi (1999: chpt.4) set out a variety of mereotopological theories in a consistent notation. This section sets out several nested theories that culminate in their preferred theory GEMTC, and follows their exposition closely. The mereological part of GEMTC is the conventional theory GEM. Casati and Varzi do not say if the models of GEMTC include any conventional topological spaces.\n\nWe begin with some domain of discourse, whose elements are called individuals (a synonym for mereology is \"the calculus of individuals\"). Casati and Varzi prefer limiting the ontology to physical objects, but others freely employ mereotopology to reason about geometric figures and events, and to solve problems posed by research in machine intelligence.\n\nAn upper case Latin letter denotes both a relation and the predicate letter referring to that relation in first-order logic. Lower case letters from the end of the alphabet denote variables ranging over the domain; letters from the start of the alphabet are names of arbitrary individuals. If a formula begins with an atomic formula followed by the biconditional, the subformula to the right of the biconditional is a definition of the atomic formula, whose variables are unbound. Otherwise, variables not explicitly quantified are tacitly universally quantified. The axiom Cn below corresponds to axiom C.n in Casati and Varzi (1999: chpt. 4).\n\nWe begin with a topological primitive, a binary relation called \"connection\"; the atomic formula \"Cxy\" denotes that \"\"x\" is connected to \"y\".\" Connection is governed, at minimum, by the axioms:\n\nC1. formula_1 (reflexive)\n\nC2. formula_2 (symmetric)\n\nNow posit the binary relation \"E\", defined as:\n\nformula_3\n\n\"Exy\" is read as \"\"y\" encloses \"x\" and is also topological in nature. A consequence of C1-2 is that \"E\" is reflexive and transitive, and hence a preorder. If \"E\" is also assumed extensional, so that:\n\nformula_4\n\nthen \"E\" can be proved antisymmetric and thus becomes a partial order. Enclosure, notated \"xKy\", is the single primitive relation of the theories in Whitehead (1919, 1925), the starting point of mereotopology. \n\nLet \"parthood\" be the defining primitive binary relation of the underlying mereology, and let the atomic formula \"Pxy\" denote that \"x\" is part of \"y\". We assume that \"P\" is a partial order. Call the resulting minimalist mereological theory M. \n\nIf \"x\" is part of \"y\", we postulate that \"y\" encloses \"x\":\n\nC3. formula_5\n\nC3 nicely connects mereological parthood to topological enclosure.\n\nLet \"O\", the binary relation of mereological \"overlap\", be defined as:\n\nformula_6\n\nLet \"Oxy\" denote that \"x\" and \"y\" overlap.\" With \"O\" in hand, a consequence of C3 is:\n\nformula_7\n\nNote that the converse does not necessarily hold. While things that overlap are necessarily connected, connected things do not necessarily overlap. If this were not the case, topology would merely be a model of mereology (in which \"overlap\" is always either primitive or defined).\n\nGround mereotopology (MT) is the theory consisting of primitive \"C\" and \"P\", defined \"E\" and \"O\", the axioms C1-3, and axioms assuring that \"P\" is a partial order. Replacing the M in MT with the standard extensional mereology GEM results in the theory GEMT.\n\nLet \"IPxy\" denote that \"\"x\" is an internal part of \"y\".\" \"IP\" is defined as:\n\nformula_8\n\nLet σ\"x\" φ(\"x\") denote the mereological sum (fusion) of all individuals in the domain satisfying φ(\"x\"). σ is a variable binding prefix operator. The axioms of GEM assure that this sum exists if φ(\"x\") is a first-order formula. With σ and the relation \"IP\" in hand, we can define the interior of \"x\", formula_9 as the mereological sum of all interior parts \"z\" of \"x\", or:\n\nformula_10 formula_11\n\nTwo easy consequences of this definition are:\n\nformula_12\n\nwhere \"W\" is the universal individual, and\n\nC5. formula_13 (Inclusion)\n\nThe operator i has two more axiomatic properties:\n\nC6. formula_14 (Idempotence)\n\nC7. formula_15 \n\nwhere \"a\"×\"b\" is the mereological product of \"a\" and \"b\", not defined when \"Oab\" is false. i distributes over product.\n\nIt can now be seen that i is isomorphic to the interior operator of topology. Hence the dual of i, the topological closure operator c, can be defined in terms of i, and Kuratowski's axioms for c are theorems. Likewise, given an axiomatization of c that is analogous to C5-7, i may be defined in terms of c, and C5-7 become theorems. Adding C5-7 to GEMT results in Casati and Varzi's preferred mereotopological theory, GEMTC.\n\n\"x\" is \"self-connected\" if it satisfies the following predicate:\n\nformula_16\n\nNote that the primitive and defined predicates of MT alone suffice for this definition. The predicate \"SC\" enables formalizing the necessary condition given in Whitehead's \"Process and Reality\" for the mereological sum of two individuals to exist: they must be connected. Formally:\n\nC8. formula_17\n\nGiven some mereotopology X, adding C8 to X results in what Casati and Varzi call the \"Whiteheadian extension\" of X, denoted WX. Hence the theory whose axioms are C1-8 is WGEMTC.\n\nThe converse of C8 is a GEMTC theorem. Hence given the axioms of GEMTC, \"C\" is a defined predicate if \"O\" and \"SC\" are taken as primitive predicates.\n\nIf the underlying mereology is atomless and weaker than GEM, the axiom that assures the absence of atoms (P9 in Casati and Varzi 1999) may be replaced by C9, which postulates that no individual has a topological boundary:\n\nC9. formula_18\n\nWhen the domain consists of geometric figures, the boundaries can be points, curves, and surfaces. What boundaries could mean, given other ontologies, is not an easy matter and is discussed in Casati and Varzi (1999: chpt. 5).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16162581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16162581", "title": "Mind monkey", "text": "Mind monkey\n\nMind monkey or monkey mind, from Chinese \"xinyuan\" and Sino-Japanese \"shin'en\" 心猿 [lit. \"heart-/mind-monkey\"], is a Buddhist term meaning \"unsettled; restless; capricious; whimsical; fanciful; inconstant; confused; indecisive; uncontrollable\". In addition to Buddhist writings, including Chan or Zen, Consciousness-only, Pure Land, and Shingon, this \"mind-monkey\" psychological metaphor was adopted in Taoism, Neo-Confucianism, poetry, drama, and literature. \"Mind-monkey\" occurs in two reversible four-character idioms with \"yima\" or \"iba\" 意馬 [lit. \"thought-/will-horse\"], most frequently used in Chinese \"xinyuanyima\" 心猿意馬 and Japanese \"ibashin'en\" 意馬心猿. The \"Monkey King\" Sun Wukong in the \"Journey to the West\" personifies the mind-monkey. Note that much of the following summarizes Carr (1993).\n\n\"Mind-monkey\" 心猿 is an exemplary animal metaphor. Some figures of speech are cross-linguistically common, verging upon linguistic universals; many languages use \"monkey\" or \"ape\" words to mean \"mimic\", for instance, Italian \"to mock; to mimic\" < \"monkey; ape\", Japanese \"sarumane\" 猿真似 [lit. \"monkey imitation\"] \"copycat; superficial imitation\", and English \"monkey see, monkey do\" or \"\"). Other animal metaphors have culture-specific meanings; compare English \"\" \"cowardly; timid'; easily frightened\" and Chinese \"jixin\" 雞心 [lit. \"chicken heart\"] \"heart-shaped; cordate\".\n\nThe four morphological elements of Chinese \"xinyuanyima\" or Japanese \"shin'en'iba\" are \"xin\" or \"shin\" 心 \"heart; mind\", \"yi\" or \"i\" 意 \"thought\", \"yuan\" or \"en\" 猿 \"monkey\", and \"ma\" or \"ba\" 馬 \"horse\"'.\n\nThe psychological components of the \"mind-monkey will-horse\" metaphor are Chinese \"xin\" or Sino-Japanese \"shin\" or \"kokoro\" \"heart; mind; feelings, affections; center\" and \"yi\" or \"i\" 'thought, idea; opinion, sentiment; will, wish; meaning'. This Chinese character 心 was graphically simplified from an original pictogram of a heart, and 意 \"thought; think\" is an ideogram combining 心 under \"yin\" \"sound; tone; voice\" denoting \"sound in the mind; thought; idea\".\n\nIn Chinese Buddhism and Japanese Buddhism, \"xin\"/\"shin\" 心 \"heart; mind\" generally translates Sanskrit \"\" \"the mind; state of mind; consciousness\" and \"yi\"/\"i\" 意 translates Sanskrit \"\" \"the mental organ; deliberation\". Some Buddhist authors have used 心 and 意 interchangeably for \"mind; cognition; thought\". Compare these \"Digital Dictionary of Buddhism\" glosses \nFor example, take the Buddhist word Chinese \"xin-yi-shi\" or Japanese \"shin-i-shiki\" 心意識 [lit. \"mind, thought, and cognition\"] that compounds three near-synonyms. Abhidharma theory uses this word as a general term for \"mind; mentality\", but Yogacara theory of Eight Consciousnesses distinguishes \"xin\"/\"shin\" 心 \"store consciousness\", \"yi\"/\"i\" 意 \"\"manas\" consciousness\", and \"shi\"/\"shiki\" 識 \"six object-contingent consciousnesses\".\n\n\"Xinyuanyima\" 心猿意馬 [lit. \"mind-monkey idea-horse\"] \"distracted; indecisive; restless\" is comparable with some other Chinese collocations.\n\nThe animal components of the \"mind-monkey will-horse\" metaphor are Chinese \"yuan\" or Japanese \"en\" \"gibbon; monkey; ape\" and \"ma\" or \"ba\" \"horse\".\n\nChinese \"yuan\" 猿 (\"yuan\" or \"nao\" ) originally meant the \"agile gibbon, black-handed gibbon, \"Hylobates agilis\"\" but now generally means \"ape; monkey\" (e.g., \"yuanren\" 猿人 [\"ape-man\"] \"Homo erectus; anthropoid apes'\"). Robert van Gulik (1967:33) concludes that until about the 14th century, \"yuan\" designated the gibbon, but due to extensive deforestation, its habitat shrank to remote southern mountains; from then on, \"the majority of Chinese writers knowing about the gibbon only by hearsay, they began to confuse him with the macaque or other Cynopithecoids.\" Other common Chinese \"monkey\" names include \"feifei\" 狒狒 \"hamadryas baboon, \"Papio hamadryas\"\", \"hou\" \"monkey; ape\", and \"mihou\" 獼猴 (\"muhou\" 母猴) or \"husun\" 猢猻 \"rhesus macaque, rhesus monkey, \"Macaca mulatta\"\", Victor H. Mair (1990:36) reconstructs Old Sinitic *\"mug-gug\", which \"probably ultimately derives from the same African word as English 'macaque'\" and is reminiscent of Sanskrit \"maraṭāsana ('monkey posture')\" (see Hanumanasana). These \"monkey; ape\" characters combine the \"dog radical\" with different phonetic elements, such as the \"yuan\" phonetic in \"yuan\" 猿.\n\nIn Chinese mythology, \"yuan\" \"gibbons\" were supposedly long-lived because they could \"yinqi\" 引氣 [\"pull qi\"] \"absorb life-force\", which is a \"daoyin\" 導引 [\"guiding and pulling\"] \"Daoist gymnastic technique\". Chinese classic texts mentioned \"monkey leaping\" and \"monkey bowing\" yoga (Miura 1989:354). One of the 2nd-century BCE Mawangdui Silk Texts depicts 28 Daoist gymnastic exercises, many of which are named after animals, including number 22 \"muhou\" \"macaque\". In the present day, \"houquan\" 猴拳 [\"monkey fist/boxing\"] \"Monkey Kung Fu\" is a Chinese martial arts style and \"xinyuanyima\" \"mind-monkey will-horse\" is a Daoist breath meditation technique. \nWhen one breathes in and out, one's concentration causes the generative force to rise and fall (in the microcosmic orbit) thus slowly turning the wheel of the law. Count from one to ten and then from ten to one hundred breaths with the heart (mind) following the counting to prevent it from wandering outside. When the heart and breathing are in unison, this is called \"locking up the monkey heart\" and \"tying up the running horse of intellect\". (Luk 1990:48) \n\nThe Japanese kanji 猿 is pronounced as Sino-Japanese \"en\" < \"yuan\" or native \"saru\" \"monkey\", especially the indigenous \"Japanese macaque, \"Macaca fuscata\"\". In Japanese Shinto tradition, the monkey deity Sarutahiko was a divine messenger. Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney (1987:41) contrasts how, \"in earlier periods the dominant meaning of the monkey was that of mediator between deities and humans. Later in history, its meaning as a scapegoat became increasingly dominant.\"\n\nChinese \"ma\" 馬 \"horse\", which was the linguistic source for Sino-Japanese \"ba\" or \"ma\" 馬 \"horse\", originally referred to Przewalski's horse and later the Mongolian horse, Ferghana horse, etc. Horses were considered divine animals in both China (see Creel 1968) and Japan. For the Chinese, Edward H. Schafer says,\nHe was invested with sanctity by ancient tradition, endowed with prodigious qualities, and visibly stamped with the marks of his divine origin. A revered myth proclaimed him a relative of the dragon, akin to the mysterious powers of water. Indeed, all wonderful horses, such as the steed of the pious Hsüan-tsang which, in later legend [see the \"Xiyouji\" below], carried the sacred scriptures from India, were avatars of dragons, and in antiquity the tallest horses owned by the Chinese were called simply \"dragons.\" (1963:59) \nFor the Japanese, the ancient Shinto practice of offering \"shinme\" 神馬 \"sacred (esp. white) horses\" to shrines has evolved into the modern donation of symbolic \"Shinto ema\" 絵馬 [lit. \"picture horse\"] \"votive tablets\"'.\n\nBesides the \"mind-monkey idea-horse\" metaphor, monkeys and horses have further associations. In Chinese astrology, \"wu\" \"Horse\" and \"shen\" \"Monkey\" are the 7th and 9th of the 12 zodiacal animals. In Chinese animal mythology, monkeys supposedly bring good health to horses. The \"Bencao Gangmu\" (tr. Read 1931, no. 400) records the \"custom of keeping a female monkey in the horse's stable to ward off sickness (the menstrual discharge of the monkey is said to give immunity to the horse against infectious diseases)\".\n\nThis section summarizes Chinese and Japanese developments of \"xinyuan\" or \"shin'en\" 心猿 \"mind-monkey\" and \"yima\" or \"iba\" 意馬 \"idea-horse\" collocations and their synonyms. The earliest known textual usages are presented chronologically.\n\nChinese authors coined \"mind monkey\" expressions from the Later Qin Dynasty (384-417 CE) through the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE). In modern usage, some terms are considered Classical Chinese, but others like \"xinyuanyima\" \"mind-monkey will-horse\" are Modern Standard Chinese. Unless otherwise noted, translations are by Carr (1993:154-159).\n\nThe c. 406 \"Weimojie suoshuo jing\" 維摩詰所說經 was Kumarajiva's groundbreaking CE Chinese translation of the \"Vimalakirti Sutra\". It introduced \"mind-monkey\" in the simile \"xin ru yuanhou\" 心如猨猴 \"heart/mind like a monkey/ape\" (with \"yuan\" 猿's variant Chinese character 猨). \"Since the mind of one difficult to convert is like an ape, govern his mind by using certain methods and it can then be broken in\" (tr. Dudbridge 1970:168). Carr (1993:169) suggests the subsequent line about \"xiang ma\" 象馬 \"elephants and horses\" having unruly natures could have affected the later \"yima\" \"idea-horse\" term.\n\nThe \"Mengyu chanhui shi\" 蒙預懺悔詩 \"Poem Repenting Foolish Pleasure\" is attributed to Emperor Jianwen of Liang (503-550 CE), who was a renowned author. This poem has the oldest known usage of \"xinyuan\" \"mind-monkey\", but with (the possibly miscopied) \"aima\" 愛馬 \"love-horse\" instead of \"yima\" 意馬 \"idea-horse\". \"The [三循/修] three disciplines/cultivations expel the [愛馬] love-horse, and the [六意/念] six recollections/ideas still the [心猿] mind-monkey.\" This Buddhistic poem has numerous graphic variants, including these \"sanxun\" 三循 \"three disciplines\" for \"sanxiu\" 三修 \"three cultivations\" (meditation on impermanence, awareness, and selflessness) and \"liuyi\" 六意 \"six ideas\" for \"liunian\" 六念 \"six recollections\" (mindfulness about Buddha, dharma, sangha, precepts, almsgiving, and heaven). Based on these contextual graphic inconsistencies, Carr (1993:156) suggests the possibility that a scribe transposed Jianwen's original \"yima\" 意馬 \"idea-horse\" as \"aima\" 愛馬 \"love-horse\".\n\nThe \"Daci'ensi sanzang fashizhuan\" 大慈恩寺三藏法師傳 \"Biography of the Tripitaka Dharma Master of the Temple of Great Compassionate Blessings\" is a biography of Xuanzang (see the \"Xiyouji\" below) written by his disciple Kuiji (or Ci'en, the namesake temple in Luoyang, see Emperor Gaozong of Tang). This record of the Consciousness-Only (Yogacara) Buddhism, has a memorial dated 657 CE that parallels \"yima\" \"idea-/will-horse\" with \"qingyuan\" 情猿 \"emotion-/feeling-monkey\": \"Now if you wish to entrust your thoughts to the Chan sect, you must make your mind as pure as still water, control your emotion-monkey's indolence and fidgeting, and restrain your idea-horse's haste and galloping.\"\n\nThe Tang Dynasty poet Xu Hun 許渾 (fl. 832-844) wrote the first known parallel between \"mind-monkey\" and \"idea-horse.\" His \"Zengti Du yinju\" 贈題杜隱居 \"Poem Written for Sir Du the Recluse\" says: \"Nature exhausts the mind-monkey's hiding, spirit disperses the idea-horse's moving/stopping. Guests who come ought to know this: both self and world are unfeeling.\"\n\nThe common \"xinyuanyima\" \"mind-monkey will-horse\" phrase dates back to a \"bianwen\" 變文 \"Vernacular Chinese transformation text\" narrative version of the \"Weimojie suoshuo jing\" (above) that was discovered in the Mogao Caves. This \"jiangjingwen\" 講經文 \"sutra lecture text\" dated 947 CE says: \"Within the indeterminable and unfathomable depths, the mind-monkey and idea-horse cease their craziness.\" \n\nThe 1075 CE \"Wuzhen pian\", which is a Daoist classic on \"Neidan\"-style internal alchemy, used \"xinyuan\" \"mind-monkey\" without \"horse\".\nThoroughly understanding the mind-monkey, the machinations in the heart, by three thousand achievements one becomes a peer of heaven. There naturally is a crucible to cook the dragon and tiger; Why is it necessary to support a household and be attached to spouse and children? (tr. Cleary 1987:118) \nCleary (1987:198) glosses \"xinyuan\" as \"the unruly mind, jumping from one object to another.\"\n\nThe Song Dynasty poet Zhu Yi 朱翌 (1098–1186 CE) reversed the Tang lyrical \"xinyuanyima\" expression into \"yimaxinyuan\" \"will-horse mind-monkey\". His \"Shuixuanshi\" 睡軒詩 \"Sleeping Porch Poem\" says: \"Haste is useless with the idea-horse and mind-monkey, so take off your baggage someplace deep within dreamland.\"\n\nThe c. 1200 \"Nan Tang shu\" 南唐書 \"History of the Southern Tang\" used the simile \"yi ru ma xin ru nao\" 意如馬心如猱 \"ideas like a horse and mind like a gibbon/monkey\". Congshan 從善 (939-987), seventh son of the figurehead Emperor Yuanzong of Southern Tang, confesses: \"Long ago in my youth, my ideas were like a horse and my mind was like a monkey. I was indolent with happiness and enjoyed lust, was pleased with rewards and forgot toil.\" \nThe c. 1590 \"Xiyouji\" 西遊記 \"\"Journey to the West\" (or \"Monkey\"\") popularized \"mind-monkey\" more than any other text. This famous Chinese novel centers upon the pilgrimage of Xuanzang to India, and frequently uses \"xinyuan\" and \"yima\" expressions (Dudbridge 1970:167, Chang 1983:200). Many are found in the couplet titles of chapters, for instance, 30 \"The evil demon attacks the true Dharma; The Horse of the Will recalls the Monkey of the Mind\". The preeminent translator Anthony C. Yu (1977:59) describes controlling the mind-monkey and will-horse as \"a theme central to the entire narrative and which receives repeated and varied developments.\" Chapter 7 has this exemplary poem:\nA monkey's transformed body weds the human mind. Mind is a monkey – this, the truth profound. The Great Sage [Buddha], Equal to Heaven, is no idle thought. For how could the post of [Bima \"Assistant of Horses\"] justly show his gifts? The Horse works with the Monkey – and this means both Mind and Will, Must firmly be harnessed and not ruled without. All things return to Nirvāna, taking this one course: In union with Tathāgata [Buddha] to live beneath twin trees. (tr. Yu 1977:168)\nMany \"Xiyouji\" scholars allegorically interpret \"xinyuan\" \"heart-/mind-monkey\" as the protagonist monkey-man Sun Wukong and \"yima\" \"idea-/will-horse\" as the dragon prince White Horse that enters the story in chapter 15. There are long-standing scholarly disagreements over whether Sun Wukong evolved from Hanuman, the monkey hero in the (3rd century BCE) \"Ramayana\". It is \"imagistically proper\" for Sun to be a monkey, says Mair (1989:662), because \"Zen thought symbolizes the restless and unbridled mind of man as an \"ape/monkey-mind\" 心猿.\"\n\nJapanese Buddhist monks not only imported Sino-Japanese vocabulary such as \"shin'en\" < \"xinyuan\" 心猿 \"mind-monkey\" and \"iba\" < \"yima\" 意馬 \"idea-horse\", but also invented analogous Japanese words like \"i'en\" 意猿 \"idea-monkey\" and \"shinba\" 心馬 \"mind-horse\". Unless otherwise noted, translations are by Carr (1993:159-161). The earliest known usages of relevant \"mind-monkey\" terminology are shown in the table below.\n\nDuring the Heian period (794-1185 CE), the Chinese \"mind-monkey\" and \"idea-horse\" were paraphrased as \"i'en\" 意猿 \"idea-monkey\" and \"shinba\" 心馬 \"mind-horse\". The 797 CE \"Sangō Shiiki\" 三教指帰 \"Indications of the Three teachings (Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism)\" was written by Kūkai, who founded esoteric Shingon Buddhism. Two passages introduced Japanese \"mind-monkey\" and \"will-horse\" neologisms. One used \"i'en\" 意猿 \"idea/will monkey\" with the common word \"nouma\" 野馬 \"wild horse\": \"The four great difficulties overexcite the wild horse's fast gallop, the twenty-six contributory causes mislead the plans of the idea-monkey.\" Another passage used \"shinba\" 心馬 \"heart/mind horse\" and \"isha\" 意車 \"idea-chariot\": \"Whip the mind-horse to gallop off in the eight directions, grease the idea chariot and gambol within the nine heavens.\"\nDuring the Kamakura period (1185–1333 CE), Pure Land Buddhism introduced the Sino-Japanese terms \"shin'en\" 心猿 \"mind-monkey\" and \"iba\" 意馬 \"idea-horse\", and an early travelogue popularized them. The \"Genkyū hōgo\" 元久法語 \"Genkyū era (1204–1206) Buddhist Sermons\" is a collection of writings by Hōnen, the founder of the Jōdo Shū. His c. 1205 \"Tozanjō 登山状 \"Mountain Climbing Description\" (tr. adapted from Carr 1993:159) uses \"iba\" with \"shin'en\": \"When you wish to enter the gate of determined goodness, then your idea-horse runs wild within the bounds of the six sense objects [\"rokujin\" 六塵 < Ayatana: \"form, sound, smell, taste, tangibility, and dharma\"]. When you wish to enter the gate of scattered goodness, then your mind-monkey gambols and jumps across the branches of the ten evil deeds [\"jūaku\" 十悪: killing, stealing, adultery, lying, cursing, slandering, equivocating, coveting, anger, and false views].\" The 1223 \"Kaidōki\" 海道記 \"Record of Coast Road Travels\" was a travelogue of the Tōkaidō (road) from Kyoto to Kamakura. It used \"shinsen\" 心船 \"heart/mind boat\" meaning \"imaginary journey\" with \"iba\" 意馬 \"idea/will horse\" and wrote \"arasaru\" 荒猿 \"wild monkey\" for \"arasu\" 荒す \"treat roughly/wildly\": \"I rowed the mind-boat for make-believe. As yet, I neither poled across myriad leagues of waves on the Coast Road, nor roughly rode the idea-horse to urge it on through clouds of the distant mountain barrier.\" \n\nDuring the early Edo period (1603–1868), the four-character Chinese collocations \"yimashinen\" 意馬心猿 and \"shinenyima\" 心猿意馬 were introduced into Japanese. The 1675 \"Man'an kana hōgo\" 卍庵仮名法語, which was a vernacular collection of Zen sermons, first used \"shin'en'iba\" 意馬心猿. \"For this reason, even if you reside somewhere with remote mountain streams and desolate tranquillity, and sit in silent contemplation, you will only be passing idle time because you are isolated from the road of the mind-monkey and idea-horse.\" The 1699 Kabuki play \"Wakoku gosuiten\" 和国五翠殿 \"Japan's Five Green Palaces\" repeatedly used \"ibashin'en\". For instance, the first act described two prisoners tied to a tree: \"They are the idea-horse and mind-monkey themselves. So if this pine tree is the pole of Absolute Reality, then these two prisoners are a greedy monkey – no, a cat – and a horse running wild; and they are just like the idea-horse and mind-monkey.\"\n\nMind monkey and monkey mind both occur in English usage, originally as translations of \"xinyuan\" or \"shin'en\" and later as culturally-independent images. Michael Carr concludes,\n\nEnglish translations of Chinese \"xinyuan\" or Japanese \"shin'en\" commonly include \"mind monkey\", \"monkey mind\", and \"monkey of the mind\".\n\nThis first list (expanded from Carr 1993:179, Table 5 Chinese-English Translation Equivalents) compares how 11 bilingual Chinese dictionaries translate \"xinyuanyima\" 心猿意馬 and \"yimaxinyuan\" 意馬心猿.\nSix of these 11 Chinese–English dictionaries enter only the common \"xinyuanyima\" \"mind-monkey idea-horse,\" 2 only the reverse \"yimaxinyuan\", and 3 enter both. Three translation equivalents give English \"ape\" rather than \"gibbon\" or \"monkey\" for \"yuan\" 猿, and \"ape\" sounds metaphorically stronger than \"monkey.\" Note how several of these dictionaries have identical translations. \n\nThis second list (expanded from Carr 1993:179, Table 7 Japanese-English Translation Equivalents) compares how 9 bilingual Japanese dictionaries translate \"ibashin'en\" 意馬心猿, none enters \"shin'en'iba\" 心猿意馬.\n\nAll 9 Japanese–English dictionaries mention \"passion\" or \"passions.\" Note how Saito's \"uncontrollable passions\" first appeared in 1930 and was copied into 6 other dictionaries. The 5 editions of Kenkyūsha's New Japanese–English Dictionary illustrate lexicographical modifications. Editors copied the \"clamorous demands of passion\" phrase from the 1st edition (\"Takenobu's …\" 1918) into all the subsequent versions. The 2nd (1931) first added \"uncontrollable\" to \"passions,\" which was copied in later editions. The 3rd edition (1954) included a literal translation \"wild horses of passions and flighty monkeys of desires\", but this was omitted from the 4th (1974) and 5th (2003, which added the definite article \"the\").\n\nExamples of \"mind monkey\" are predictably common in Chinese popular culture. For instance, \"Sam yuen yi ma\" 心猿意馬 – the Cantonese pronunciation of \"Xinyuanyima\" \"mind-monkey will-horse\" – was a 1999 Hong Kong movie (known in English as \"The Accident\") by Stanley Kwan. However, examples of \"mind monkey\" are surprisingly widespread in modern English culture. For instance, there are blogs named \"Mind Monkey!\", \"Mind of the Monkey\", \"Monkey Mind\", and \"No monkey mind\". Author Steve Michael Reedy explores the concept of the Monkey Mind through his collection of children's fantasy stories in \"Tales For Your Monkey's Mind.\"\n\nIn English-language publishing, fewer books are titled with \"mind monkey\", such as \"Master the Mind Monkey\" (Patkar 2007), than \"monkey mind\". \"Taming\" is common among \"Taming the Monkey Mind\" (Chodron 1999), \"Taming the Monkey Mind; A Guide to Pure Land Practice\" (Cheng 2000), and \"Taming Our Monkey Mind: Insight, Detachment, Identity\" (Krystal 2007). Other examples of book titles include \"Samba and the Monkey Mind\" (Williams 1965), \"Meeting the Monkey Halfway\" (Sumano and Popp 2000), \"Your Monkey Mind Connection\" (Antoinette 2007), and \"Still the Monkey\" (Alivia 2007). \n\nThe originally Buddhist \"mind monkey\" metaphor is also known in popular English-language music. \"Mad Melancholy Monkey Mind\" is a band. There are albums entitled \"Mind Monkey\" (Bill Foreman 1999), \"Monkey Mind\" (Wonder Stump, 2003), and \"Monkey Mind Control\" (Jay Roulston 2003).

{"id": "32128954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32128954", "title": "Motivated reasoning", "text": "Motivated reasoning\n\nMotivated reasoning is an emotion-biased decision-making phenomenon studied in cognitive science and social psychology. This term describes the role of motivation in cognitive processes such as decision-making and attitude change in a number of paradigms, including:\n\nThe processes of motivated reasoning are a type of inferred justification strategy which is used to mitigate cognitive dissonance. When people form and cling to false beliefs despite overwhelming evidence, the phenomenon is labeled \"motivated reasoning\". In other words, \"rather than search rationally for information that either confirms or disconfirms a particular belief, people actually seek out information that confirms what they already believe\".\nThis is \"a form of implicit emotion regulation in which the brain converges on judgments that minimize negative and maximize positive affect states associated with threat to or attainment of motives\".\n\nEarly research on the evaluation and integration of information supported a cognitive approach consistent with Bayesian probability, in which individuals weighted new information using rational calculations.\nMore recent theories endorse cognitive processes as partial explanations of motivated reasoning but have also introduced motivational or affective processes to further illuminate the mechanisms of the bias inherent in cases of motivated reasoning. To further complicate the issue, the first neuro-imaging study designed to test the neural circuitry of individuals engaged in motivated reasoning found that motivated reasoning \"was not associated with neural activity in regions previously linked with cold reasoning tasks [Bayesian reasoning] and conscious (explicit) emotion regulation\". \nThis section focuses on two theories that elucidate the mechanisms involved in motivated reasoning. Both theories distinguish between mechanisms present when the individual is trying to reach an accurate conclusion, and those present when the individual has a directional goal.\n\nOne review of the research develops the following theoretical model to explain the mechanism by which motivated reasoning results in bias. The model is summarized as follows:\n\nMotivation to arrive at a desired conclusion provides a level of arousal, which acts as an initial trigger for the operation of cognitive processes. Historically, motivated reasoning theory identifies that directional goals enhance the accessibility of knowledge structures (memories, information, knowledge) that are consistent with desired conclusions. This theory endorses previous research on accessing information, but adds a procedural component in specifying that the motivation to achieve directional goals will also influence which rules (procedural structures such as inferential rules) and which beliefs are accessed to guide the search for information. In this model the beliefs and rule structures are instrumental in directing which information will be obtained to support the desired conclusion.\n\nIn comparison, Milton Lodge and Charles Taber (2000) introduce an empirically supported model in which affect is intricately tied to cognition, and information processing is biased toward support for positions that the individual already holds.\n\nThis model has three components:\n\n\nThis theory of motivated reasoning is fully developed and tested in Lodge and Taber's \"The Rationalizing Voter\" (2013). David Redlawsk (2002) found that the timing of when disconfirming information was introduced played a role in determining bias. When subjects encountered incongruity during an information search, the automatic assimilation and update process was interrupted. This results in one of two outcomes: subjects may enhance attitude strength in a desire to support existing affect (resulting in degradation in decision quality and potential bias) or, subjects may counter-argue existing beliefs in an attempt to integrate the new data. This second outcome is consistent with the research on how processing occurs when one is tasked with accuracy goals.\n\nKunda asserts that accuracy goals delay the process of coming to a premature conclusion, in that accuracy goals increase both the quantity and quality of processing—particularly in leading to more complex inferential cognitive processing procedures.\nWhen researchers manipulated test subjects motivation to be accurate by informing them that the target task was highly important or that they would be expected to defend their judgments, it was found that subjects utilized deeper processing, and that there was less biasing of information. This was true when accuracy motives were present at the initial processing and encoding of information. Tetlock (1983, 1985) \nIn reviewing a line of research on accuracy goals and bias, Kunda concludes, \"several different kinds of biases have been shown to weaken in the presence of accuracy goals\". She asserts that for accuracy to reduce bias the following conditions must be present. \n\nThese last two conditions introduce the construct that accuracy goals include a conscious process of utilizing cognitive strategies in motivated reasoning. This construct is called into question by later neuroscience research that concludes that motivated reasoning is qualitatively distinct from reasoning (in instances when there is no strong emotional stake in the outcomes), (Weston, 2006 ).\n\nIn summary, both models differentiate between accuracy goals, and goal directed processing. They differ in that Redlawsk identifies a primary role for affect in guiding cognitive processes and in maintaining bias. In contrast, Kunda identifies a primary role for cognitive processes such as memory processes, and the use of rules in determining biased information selection. At least one study in neuroscience does not support the use of cognitive processes in motivated reasoning, lending greater support to affective processing as a key mechanism in supporting bias. \nOf interest, neuroscience is consistent with Freud's (1933) theory of \"defensive processing\" which occurred in the unconscious, and was seen as a mechanism to avoid feelings of anxiety and guilt.\n\nNeuroscientific research suggest that \"motivated reasoning is qualitatively distinct from reasoning when people do not have a strong emotional stake in the conclusions reached.\"\n\nSocial science research suggests that reasoning away contradictions is psychologically easier than revising feelings. In this sense, emotions are shown to color how \"facts\" are perceived. Feelings come first, and evidence is used mostly in service of those feelings. Evidence that supports what is already believed is accepted, that which contradicts it is not.\n\nThe outcomes of motivated reasoning derive from \"a biased set of cognitive processes—that is, strategies for accessing, constructing, and evaluating beliefs. The motivation to be accurate enhances use of those beliefs and strategies that are considered most appropriate, whereas the motivation to arrive at particular conclusions enhances use of those that are considered most likely to yield the desired conclusion.\"\n\nResearch on motivated reasoning tested accuracy goals (i.e., reaching correct conclusions) and directional goals (i.e., reaching preferred conclusions). Factors such as these affect perceptions; and results confirm that motivated reasoning affects decision-making and estimates.\n\n"}

(for) the performers of works…the discipline of works may promote life’s ends by endowing the agent with the fitness to adopt the discipline of knowledge, and not independently, by itself, whereas the discipline of knowledge, generated by that of works, is totally independent means to life’s supreme end.\" In this Sloka, the word \"Nishtha\" means ‘devoted to’, ‘established in’. Faith with trust and dedication is called \"shraddha\"; faith with trust and confidence is \"nishtha\", in this \"sloka\", Krishna speaks about the twofold path of faith and confidence. Self-knowledge (\"atma jnana\") can exist when self-knowledge is not fully established; \"Jnana-nishtha\" refers to self-knowledge that is fully assimilated and established.\n\nSanatkumara tells Narada (Chandogya Upanishad VII.xx.1 and VII.xxi.1) that when one serves devotedly, then one becomes endowed with faith; without serving devotedly one does not acquire faith, and that when one acts, then one serves devotedly. The word \"Nishtha\" or 'devotion', appearing in the former passage, is used to mean - 'steadiness'. Even though the text says nothing about a teacher, to Sankara it indicates the steadfast seeking of a teacher’s wisdom for acquiring knowledge of Brahman; and to Prabhavananda it indicates gain of faith by attending on a teacher. Sankara states – A distinction has been made between \"Jnana-nishtha\" (ज्ञान-निष्ठा) and \"Karma-nishtha\" (कर्म-निष्ठा).Vedic works are intended for him only who has desires; the renunciation of these works is enjoined on him who seeks only the Self.

{"id": "30210829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30210829", "title": "Object-oriented ontology", "text": "Object-oriented ontology\n\nIn metaphysics, object-oriented ontology (OOO) is a 21st-century Heidegger-influenced school of thought that rejects the privileging of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects. This is in contrast to what it calls the \"anthropocentrism\" of Kant's Copernican Revolution, as accepted by most other current metaphysics, in which phenomenal objects are said to conform to the mind of the subject and, in turn, become products of human cognition. Object-oriented ontology maintains that objects exist independently (as Kantian noumena) of human perception and are not ontologically exhausted by their relations with humans or other objects. Thus, for object-oriented ontologists, all relations, including those between nonhumans, distort their related objects in the same basic manner as human consciousness and exist on an equal footing with one another.\n\nObject-oriented ontology is often viewed as a subset of speculative realism, a contemporary school of thought that criticizes the post-Kantian reduction of philosophical enquiry to a correlation between thought and being, such that the reality of anything outside of this correlation is unknowable. Object-oriented ontology predates speculative realism, however, and makes distinct claims about the nature and equality of object relations to which not all speculative realists agree. The term \"object-oriented philosophy\" was coined by Graham Harman, the movement's founder, in his 1999 doctoral dissertation \"Tool-Being: Elements in a Theory of Objects\". In 2009, Levi Bryant rephrased Harman's original designation as \"object-oriented ontology\", giving the movement its current name.\n\nThe term \"object-oriented philosophy” was coined by speculative philosopher Graham Harman in his 1999 doctoral dissertation \"Tool-Being: Elements in a Theory of Objects\" (later revised and published as \"Tool-Being: Heidegger and the Metaphysics of Objects\"). For Harman, Heideggerian \"Zuhandenheit\", or readiness-to-hand, refers to the withdrawal of objects from human perception into a reality that cannot be manifested by practical or theoretical action. Furthering this idea, Harman contends that when objects withdraw in this way, they distance themselves from other objects, as well as humans. Resisting pragmatic interpretations of Heidegger's thought, then, Harman is able to propose an object-oriented account of metaphysical substances. Following the publication of Harman's early work, several scholars from varying fields began employing object-oriented principles in their own work. Levi Bryant began what he describes as \"a very intense philosophical email exchange\" with Harman, over the course of which Bryant became convinced of the credibility of object-oriented thought. Bryant subsequently coined the term \"object-oriented ontology\" in 2009 to distinguish those ontologies committed to an account of being composed of discrete beings from Harman's object-oriented philosophy, thus marking a difference between object-oriented philosophy (OOP) and object-oriented ontology (OOO).\n\nWhile object-oriented philosophers reach different conclusions, they share common precepts, including a critique of anthropocentrism and correlationism and a rejection of \"preservation of finitude\", \"withdrawal\", and philosophies that undermine or \"overmine\" objects.\n\nAnthropocentrism is the privileging of humans as \"subjects\" over and against nonhuman beings as \"objects\". The widespread tendency frequently limits attributes such as mind, autonomy, moral agency, reason, and the like to humans, while contrasting all other beings as variations of \"object\", or things obeying deterministic laws, impulses, stimuli, instincts, and so on. Beginning with Kant's epistemology, modern philosophers began articulating a \"transcendent\" anthropocentrism, whereby the Kantian argument that objects are unknowable outside of the imposed, distorting categories of the human mind in turn shores up discourses wherein objects frequently become effectively reduced to mere products of human cognition. In contrast to Kant's view, object-oriented philosophers maintain that objects exist independently of human perception, and that nonhuman object relations distort their related objects in the same fundamental manner as human consciousness. Thus, all object relations, human and nonhuman, are said to exist on equal ontological footing with one another.\n\nRelated to 'anthropocentrism', object-oriented thinkers reject correlationism, which the French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux defines as \"the idea according to which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the other\". Because object-oriented ontology is the realist philosophy, it stands in contradistinction to the anti-realist trajectory of correlationism, which restricts philosophical understanding to the correlation of being with thought by disavowing any reality external to this correlation as inaccessible, and, in this way, fails to escape the ontological reification of human experience.\n\nObject-oriented thought holds that there are two principal strategies for devaluing the philosophical import of objects. First, one can undermine objects by claiming that they are an effect or manifestation of a deeper, underlying substance or force. Second, one can \"overmine\" objects by either an idealism which holds that there is nothing beneath what appears in the mind or, as in social constructionism, by positing no independent reality outside of language, discourse or power. Object-oriented philosophy rejects both undermining and \"overmining\".\n\nUnlike other speculative realisms, object-oriented ontology maintains the concept of finitude, whereby relation to an object cannot be translated into direct and complete knowledge of an object. Since all object relations distort their related objects, every relation is said to be an act of translation, with the caveat that no object can perfectly translate another object into its own nomenclature. Object-oriented ontology does not restrict finitude to humanity, however, but extends it to all objects as an inherent limitation of relationality.\n\nObject-oriented ontology holds that objects are independent not only of other objects, but also from the qualities they animate at any specific spatiotemporal location. Accordingly, objects cannot be exhausted by their relations with humans or other objects in theory or practice, meaning that the reality of objects is always present-at-hand. The retention by an object of a reality in excess of any relation is known as \"withdrawal\".\n\nIn \"Tool-Being: Heidegger and the Metaphysics of Objects\", Graham Harman interprets the tool-analysis contained in Martin Heidegger's \"Being and Time\" as inaugurating an ontology of objects themselves, rather than the valorization of practical action or networks of signification. According to Harman, Heideggerian \"Zuhandenheit\", or readiness-to-hand, indicates the withdrawal of objects from both practical and theoretical action, such that objectcal reality cannot be exhausted by either practical usage or theoretical investigation. Harman further contends that objects withdraw not just from human interaction, but also from other objects. He maintains:\n\nFrom this, Harman concludes that the primary site of ontological investigation is objects and relations, instead of the post-Kantian emphasis on the human-world correlate. Moreover, this holds true for all entities, be they human, nonhuman, natural, or artificial, leading to the downplayment of \"dasein\" as an ontological priority. In its place, Harman proposes a concept of substances that are irreducible to both material particles and human perception, and \"exceed every relation into which they might enter\".\n\nCoupling Heidegger's tool-analysis with the phenomenological insights of Edmund Husserl, Harman introduces two types of objects: \"real objects\" and \"sensual objects\". Real objects are objects that withdraw from all experience, whereas sensual objects are those that exist only in experience. Additionally, Harman suggests two kinds of qualities: \"sensual qualities\", or those found in experience, and \"real qualities\", which are accessed through intellectual probing. Pairing sensual and real objects and qualities yields the following framework:\n\n\nTo explain how withdrawn objects make contact with and relate to one another, Harman submits the theory of \"vicarious causation\", whereby two hypothetical entities meet in the interior of a third entity, existing side-by-side until something occurs to prompt interaction. Harman compares this idea to the classical notion of formal causation, in which forms do not directly touch, but influence one another in a common space \"from which all are partly absent\". Causation, says Harman, is always vicarious, asymmetrical, and buffered:\n\nThus, causation entails the connection between a real object residing within the directionality of consciousness, or a unified \"intention,\" with another real object residing outside of the intention, where the intention itself is also classified as a real object. From here, Harman extrapolates five types of relations between objects. \"Containment\" describes a relation in which the intention \"contains\" both the real object and sensual object. \"Contiguity\" connotes relations between sensual objects lying side-by-side within an intention, not affecting one another, such that a sensual object's bystanders can be rearranged without disrupting the object's identity. \"Sincerity\" characterizes the absorption of a real object by a sensual object, in a manner that \"takes seriously\" the sensual object without containing or being contiguous to it. \"Connection\" conveys the vicarious generation of intention by real objects indirectly encountering one another. Finally, \"no relation\" represents the typical condition of reality, since real objects are incapable of direct interaction and are limited in their causal influence upon and relation to other objects.\n\nSince its inception by Graham Harman in 1999, many authors in a variety of disciplines have adapted and expanded upon Harman's ideas.\n\nLike Harman, Levi Bryant opposes post-Kantian anthropocentrism and philosophies of access. From Bryant's perspective, the Kantian contention that reality is accessible to human knowledge because it is structured by human cognition limits philosophy to a self-reflexive analysis of the mechanisms and institutions through which cognition structures reality. He states:\n\nTo counter the form of post-Kantian epistemology, Bryant articulates an object-oriented philosophy called onticology, grounded in three principles. First, the \"Ontic Principle\" states that \"there is no difference that does not make a difference\". Following from the premises that questions of difference precede epistemological interrogation and that to be is to create differences, this principle posits that knowledge cannot be fixed prior to engagement with difference. And so, for Bryant, the thesis that there is a thing-in-itself which we cannot know is untenable because it presupposes forms of being that make no differences. Similarly, concepts of difference predicated upon negation—that which objects are not or lack when placed in comparison with one another—are dismissed as arising only from the perspective of consciousness, rather than an ontological difference that affirms independent being. Second, the \"Principle of the Inhuman\" asserts that the concept of difference producing difference is not restricted to human, sociocultural, or epistemological domains, thereby marking the being of difference as independent of knowledge and consciousness. Humans exist as difference-making beings among other difference-making beings, therefore, without holding any special position with respect to other differences. Third, the \"Ontological Principle\" maintains that if there is no difference that does not also make a difference, then the making of difference is the minimal condition for the existence of being. In Bryant's words, \"if a difference is made, then the being is\". Bryant further contends that differences produced by an object can be \"inter-ontic\" (made with respect to another object) or \"intra-ontic\" (pertaining the internal constitution of the object).\n\nOnticology distinguishes between four different types of objects: bright objects, dim objects, dark objects, and rogue objects. \"Bright objects\" are objects that strongly manifest themselves and heavily impact other objects, such as the ubiquity of cell phones in high-tech cultures. \"Dim objects\" lightly manifest themselves in an assemblage of objects; for example, a neutrino passing through solid matter without producing observable effects. \"Dark objects\" are objects that are so completely withdrawn that they produce no local manifestations and do not affect any other objects. \"Rogue objects\" are not chained to any given assemblage of objects, but instead wander in and out of assemblages, modifying relations within the assemblages into which they enter. Political protestors exemplify rogue objects by breaking with the norms and relations of a dominant political assemblage in order to forge new relations that challenge, change, or cast off the prior assemblage. Additionally, Bryant has proposed the concept of 'wilderness ontology' to explain the philosophical pluralization of agency away from human privilege.\n\nTimothy Morton became involved with object-oriented ontology after his ecological writings were favorably compared with the movement's ideas. In \"The Ecological Thought\", Morton introduced the concept of \"hyperobjects\" to describe objects that are so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend spatiotemporal specificity, such as global warming, styrofoam, and radioactive plutonium. He has subsequently enumerated five characteristics of hyperobjects:\n\n\nAccording to Morton, hyperobjects not only become visible during an age of ecological crisis, but alert humans to the ecological dilemmas defining the age in which they live. Additionally, the existential capacity of hyperobjects to outlast a turn toward less materialistic cultural values, coupled with the threat many such objects pose toward organic matter gives them a potential spiritual quality, in which their treatment by future societies may become indistinguishable from reverential care.\n\nIan Bogost, a video game researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology and founding partner of Persuasive Games, has articulated an \"applied\" object-oriented ontology, concerned more with the being of specific objects than the exploration of foundational principles. Bogost calls his approach \"alien phenomenology\", with the term \"alien\" designating the manner in which withdrawal accounts for the inviolability of objectal experience. From this perspective, an object may not recognize the experience of other objects because objects relate to one another using metaphors of selfhood.\n\nAlien phenomenology is grounded in three \"modes\" of practice. First, \"ontography\" entails the production of works that reveal the existence and relation of objects. Second, \"metaphorism\" denotes the production of works that speculate about the \"inner lives\" of objects, including how objects translate the experience of other objects into their own terms. Third, \"carpentry\" indicates the creation of artifacts that illustrate the perspective of objects, or how objects construct their own worlds. Bogost sometimes refers to his version of object-oriented thought as a \"tiny ontology\" to emphasize his rejection of rigid ontological categorization of forms of being, including distinctions between \"real\" and \"fictional\" objects.\n\nSome commentators contend that object-oriented ontology degrades meaning by placing humans and objects on equal footing. Matthew David Segall has argued that object-oriented philosophers should explore the theological and anthropological implications of their ideas in order to avoid \"slipping into the nihilism of some speculative realists, where human values are a fluke in an uncaring and fundamentally entropic universe\". Other critical commentators such as David Berry and Alexander Galloway have commented on the historical situatedness of an ontology that mirrors computational processes and even the metaphors and language of computation.\n\nCultural critic Steven Shaviro has criticized object-oriented ontology as too dismissive of process philosophy. According to Shaviro, the process philosophies of Alfred North Whitehead, Gilbert Simondon, and Gilles Deleuze account for how objects come into existence and endure over time, in contrast to the view that objects \"are already there\" taken by object-oriented approaches. Shaviro also finds fault with Harman's assertion that Whitehead, Simondon, and Iain Hamilton Grant undermine objects by positing objects as manifestations of a deeper, underlying substance, saying that the antecedence of these thinkers, particularly Grant and Simondon, includes the \"plurality of actually existing objects\", rather than a single substance of which objects are mere epiphenomena.\n\n"}

The term \"outgroup homogeneity effect\", \"outgroup homogeneity bias\" or \"relative outgroup homogeneity\" has been explicitly contrasted with \"outgroup homogeneity\" in general, the latter referring to perceived outgroup variability unrelated to perceptions of the ingroup.\n\nThe out-group homogeneity effect is part of a broader field of research that examines perceived group variability. This area includes in-group homogeneity effects as well as out-group homogeneity effects, and it also deals with perceived group variability effects that are not linked to in-group/out-group membership, such as effects that are related to the power, status, and size of groups.\n\nThe out-group homogeneity effect has been found using a wide variety of different social groups, from political and racial groups to age and gender groups.\n\nThe implications of this effect on stereotyping have been noted. Perceivers tend to have impressions about the diversity or variability of group members around those central tendencies or typical attributes of those group members. Thus, outgroup stereotypicality judgments are overestimated, supporting the view that out-group stereotypes are overgeneralizations.\n\nThe outgroup homogeneity effect is sometimes referred to as \"outgroup homogeneity bias\".

This debate centres on the validity of heightened perceptions of ingroup and outgroup homogeneity, where some researchers view the homogeneity effect as an example of cognitive bias and error, while other researchers view the effect as an example of normal and often adaptive social perception.\n\nAnother example of this phenomenon comes from a study where researchers asked 90 sorority members to judge the degree of within-group similarity for their own and 2 other groups. It was found that every participant judged their own sorority members to be more dissimilar than the members of the other groups.\n\nIn an experiment, researchers revealed that people of other races do seem to look more alike than members of one's own race. When white students were shown faces of a few white and a few black individuals, they later more accurately recognized white faces they had seen and often falsely recognized black faces not seen before. The opposite results were found when subjects consisted of black individuals.\n\nThis bias was found to be unrelated to the number of group and non-group members individuals knew. One might think that people thought members of their own groups were more varied and different simply because they knew them better and thus have more information about ingroups, but this is actually not the case. The out-group homogeneity bias was found between groups such as \"men\" and \"women\" who obviously interact frequently.\n\nElsewhere, this difference is attributed to differences in how people store or process in-group versus out-group information. However, this concept has been challenged due to some cases in which in-groups view themselves as homogeneous. Researchers have postulated that such an effect is present when viewing a group as homogeneous helps to promote in-group solidarity. Experiments on the topic found that in-group homogeneity is displayed when people who highly identify with a group are presented with stereotypical information about that group.\n\nSelf-categorization theory attributes the outgroup homogeneity effect to the differing contexts that are present when perceiving outgroups and ingroups. For outgroups, a perceiver will experience an intergroup context and therefore attend to differences between the two groups. Consequently, less attention is paid to differences between outgroup members and this leads to perceptions of outgroup homogeneity. When perceiving ingroup members a perceiver may experience either an intergroup context or an \"intragroup\" context. In an intergroup context the ingroup would also be predicted to be seen as comparatively homogeneous as the perceiver attends to the differences between “us” and “them” (in other words, depersonalization occurs). However, in an intragroup context the perceiver may be motivated to attend to differences with the group (between “me” and “others in the group”) leading to perceptions of comparative ingroup heterogeneity. As perceivers are less often motivated to perform intra-group outgroup comparison, this leads to an overall outgroup homogeneity effect.\n\nThe self-categorization theory account is supported by evidence showing that in an intergroup context both the ingroup and outgroup will be perceived as more homogenous, while when judged in isolation the ingroup will be perceived as comparatively heterogeneous. The self-categorization theory account eliminates the need to posit differing processing mechanisms for ingroups and outgroups, as well as accounting for findings of outgroup homogeneity in the minimal group paradigm.\n\nAnother body of research looked at ingroup and outgroup homogeneity from the perspective of social identity theory. While complementary to the self-categorization theory account, this body of research was concerned more with specific homogeneity effects associated with the motivations of perceivers. They derived from social identity theory the prediction that comparative \"ingroup\" homogeneity will at times arise due to demands to establish a positive and distinct social identity. For example, members of minority groups would be particularly likely to accentuate intragroup solidity through the emphasis of ingroup homogeneity. This is because minority group members, due to their minority status, are likely to experience threat to their self-esteem. This was empirically supported.\n\nWithin the same tradition it was also hypothesised that an ingroup homogeneity effect would emerge on ingroup defining dimensions for both minority and majority group members. This too was empirically supported. Recent research also has reaffirmed that this effect of in-group homogeneity on in-group defining dimensions and out-group homogeneity on out-group defining dimensions may occur because people use their ratings of perceived group variability to express the extent to which social groups possess specific characteristics. Like the self-categorization theory account, this recent research also suggests that the effect may occur \"independent\" of the motivational concerns described in social identity theory.\n\n\n\n"}

Aspects of a complex technical specification may necessarily have more than one interpretation, and there are probably many optional features. These aspects constitute a profile of the standard. Two implementations engineered from the same description may not interoperate due to having a different profile of the standard. Vendors can even ignore features that they view as unimportant, yet prevail in the long run. \n\nThe use of profiles in these ways can force one interpretation, or create de facto standards from official standards. Engineers can design or procure by using a profile to ensure interoperability. For example, the International Standard Profile, ISP, is used by the ISO in their ISO ISP series of standards; in the context of OSI networking, Britain uses the UK-GOSIP profile and the US uses US-GOSIP; there are also various mobile profiles adopted by the W3C for web standards. In particular, implementations of standards on mobile devices often have significant limitations compared to their traditional desktop implementations, even if the standard which governs both permits such limitations. \n\nIn structural engineering a profile means a hot rolled structural steel shape like an -beam.\n\nIn civil engineering, a profile consists of a plotted line which indicates grades and distances (and typically depths of cut and/or elevations of fill) for excavation and grading work. Constructors of roadways, railways (and similar works) normally chart the profile along the centerline. A profile can also indicate the vertical slope(s) (changes in elevation) in a pipeline or similar structure. Civil engineers always depict profile as a side (cross section) view (as opposed to an overhead (plan) view).\n\nIn fabricating, a profile consists of the more-or-less complex outline of a shape to be cut in a sheet of material such as laminated plastic, aluminium alloy or steel plate. In modern practice, a drawing office determines the shape and dimensions required to fit the sheet into a larger work and feeds directions to a computer controlling a profile cutter. This then cuts the shape from a standard-sized sheet. The cutting head may use a rotating cutter like that of a spindle router or (in the case of steel plate) a torch which burns oxy-acetylene or other oxy-gas. \n\n"}
{"id": "456706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=456706", "title": "Rebirth (Buddhism)", "text": "Rebirth (Buddhism)\n\nRebirth in Buddhism refers to its teaching that the actions of a person lead to a new existence after death, in endless cycles called \"saṃsāra\". This cycle is considered to be \"dukkha\", unsatisfactory and painful. The cycle stops only if liberation is achieved by insight and the extinguishing of desire. Rebirth is one of the foundational doctrines of Buddhism, along with Karma, nirvana and moksha.\n\nThe rebirth doctrine in Buddhism, sometimes referred to as reincarnation or metempsychosis, asserts that rebirth does not necessarily take place as another human being, but as an existence in one of the six \"Gati\" (realms) called \"Bhavachakra\". The six realms of rebirth include Deva (heavenly), Asura (demigod), Manusya (human), Tiryak (animals), Preta (ghosts), and Naraka (resident of hell). This rebirth, state Buddhism traditions, is determined by karma, with good realms favored by \"Kushala\" (good karma), while a rebirth in evil realms is a consequence of \"Akushala\" (bad karma). While Nirvana is the ultimate goal of Buddhist teaching, much of traditional Buddhist practice has been centered on gaining merit and merit transfer, whereby one gains rebirth in the good realms and avoids rebirth in the evil realms.\n\nThe rebirth doctrine has been a subject of scholarly studies within Buddhism since ancient times, particularly in reconciling the rebirth doctrine with its \"Anatman\" (no self, no soul) doctrine. The Buddhist traditions have disagreed on what it is in a person that is reborn, as well as how quickly the rebirth occurs after each death. Some Buddhist traditions assert that \"no self\" doctrine means that there is no perduring self, but there is \"avacya\" (inexpressible) self which migrates from one life to another. The majority of Buddhist traditions, in contrast, assert that Vijnana (a person's consciousness) though evolving, exists as a continuum and is the mechanistic basis of what undergoes rebirth, rebecoming and redeath. Some traditions assert that the rebirth occurs immediately, while others such as the Tibetan Buddhism posits an interim state wherein as many of 49 days pass between death and rebirth and this belief drives the local funerary rituals.\n\nThere is no word corresponding exactly to the English terms \"rebirth\", \"metempsychosis\", \"transmigration\" or \"reincarnation\" in the traditional Buddhist languages of Pāli and Sanskrit. Rebirth is referred to by various terms, representing an essential step in the endless cycle of \"samsara\", terms such as \"re-becoming\" or \"becoming again\"(Sanskrit: punarbhava, Pali: punabbhava), re-born (\"punarjanman\"), re-death (\"punarmrityu\"), or sometimes just \"becoming\" (Pali/Sanskrit: bhava), while the state one is born into, the individual process of being born or coming into the world in any way, is referred to simply as \"birth\" (Pali/Sanskrit: jāti). The entire universal process of beings being reborn again and again is called \"wandering about\" (Pali/Sanskrit: ).\n\nSome English-speaking Buddhists prefer the term \"rebirth\" or \"re-becoming\" (Sanskrit: \"punarbhava\"; Pali: \"punabbhava\") to \"reincarnation\" as they take the latter to imply an entity (soul) that is reborn. Buddhism denies there is any such soul or self in a living being, but does assert that there is a cycle of transmigration consisting of rebirth and redeath as the fundamental nature of existence.\n\nBefore the time of the Buddha, many ideas on the nature of existence, birth and death were in vogue. The ancient Indian Vedic and Sramana schools affirmed the idea of soul, karma and cycle of rebirth. The competing Indian materialist schools denied the idea of soul, karma and rebirth, asserting instead that there is just one life, there is no rebirth, and death marks complete annihilation. From these diverse views, Buddha accepted the premises and concepts related to rebirth, but introduced innovations. According to various Buddhist scriptures, Buddha believed in other worlds,\n\nBuddha also asserted that there is karma, which influences the future suffering through the cycle of rebirth, but added that there is a way to end the cycle of karmic rebirths through \"nirvana\". The Buddha introduced the concept that there is no soul (self) tying the cycle of rebirths, in contrast to themes asserted by various Hindu and Jaina traditions, and this central concept in Buddhism is called \"anattā\"; Buddha also affirmed the idea that all compounded things are subject to dissolution at death or \"anicca\". The Buddha's detailed conception of the connections between action (karma), rebirth and causality is set out in the twelve links of dependent origination.\n\nThere are many references to rebirth in the early Buddhist scriptures. These are some of the more important; Mahakammavibhanga Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 136); Upali Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 56); Kukkuravatika Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 57); Moliyasivaka Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya 36.21); Sankha Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya 42.8).\nRebirth is discussed in Buddhist scriptures with various terms, such as \"Āgati-gati\", \"Punarbhava\" and others. The term \"Āgati\" literally means 'coming back, return', while \"Gati\" means 'going away' and \"Punarbhava\" means 're-becoming'. \"Āgati-gati\" in the sense of rebirth and re-death appears in many places in early Buddhist texts, such as in Samyutta Nikaya III.53, Jataka II.172, Digha Nikaya I. 162, Anguttara III.54-74 and Petavatthu II.9. \"Punarbhava\" in the sense of rebirth, similarly appears in many places, such as in Digha II.15, Samyutta I.133 and 4.201, Itivuttaka 62, Sutta-nipata 162, 273, 502, 514 and 733. Numerous other terms for rebirths are found in the Buddhist scriptures, such as \"Punagamana\", \"Punavasa\", \"Punanivattati\", \"Abhinibbatti\", and words with roots of \"*jati\" and \"*rupa\".\n\nWhile all Buddhist traditions except Navayana accept some notion of rebirth, they differ in their theories about rebirth mechanism and precisely how events unfold after the moment of death. The early Buddhist texts suggest that Buddha faced a difficulty in explaining what is reborn and how rebirth occurs, after he innovated the concept that there is \"no self\" (Anatta). The texts also suggest that the \"Anicca\" theory led to difficulties in explaining that there is a permanent consciousness that moves from life to life. Later Buddhist scholars such as Buddhaghosa suggested that the lack of a self or soul does not mean lack of continuity; and the rebirth across different realms of birth – such as heavenly, human, animal, hellish and others – occurs in the same way that a flame is transferred from one candle to another.\n\nThe Sautrantika sub-school of the Saravastivada Buddhist tradition, that emerged in 2nd century BCE, and influenced the 4th-century CE Yogacara school of Buddhism, introduced the idea of \"transmigrating substratum of consciousness\". It stated that each personal act \"perfumes\" the individual and leads to the planting of a \"seed\" that would later germinate as a good or bad karmic result.\n\nThe Pudgalavada school of early Buddhism accepted the core premise of Buddhism that there is no \"attā\" (ātman, soul, self), but asserted that there is a \"personal entity\" (\"pudgala\", \"puggala\") that retains a karma balance sheet and is mechanistically involved in rebirth; this personal entity, stated Pudgalavada Buddhists, is neither different nor identical to the five aggregates (skandhas). This concept of personal entity to explain rebirth by Pudgalavada Buddhists was polemically attacked by Theravada Buddhists in early 1st millennium CE. The personal entity concept was rejected by the mid-1st millennium CE Pali scholar Buddhaghosa, who attempted to explain rebirth mechanism with \"rebirth-linking consciousness\" (\"patisandhi\").\nSome schools conclude that karma continued to exist and adhere to the person until it had worked out its consequences. Theravada Buddhists assert that rebirth is immediate while the Tibetan schools hold to the notion of a bardo (intermediate state) that can last up to forty-nine days.\n\nThe \"bardo\" rebirth concept of Tibetan Buddhism, along with \"Yidam\", developed independently in Tibet, and involves forty two peaceful deities, and fifty eight wrathful deities. These ideas led to mechanistic maps on karma and what form of rebirth one takes after death, discussed in texts such as \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\".\n\nAnother mechanistic rebirth theory that emerged in Buddhism posits that a being is reborn through \"evolving consciousness\" (Pali: \"samvattanika viññana,\" M.1.256) or \"stream of consciousness\" (Pali: \"viññana sotam\", D.3.105) that reincarnates. Death dissolves all prior aggregates (Pali: \"khandha\"s, Sanskrit: \"skandha\"s), and this consciousness stream combined with karma of a being contributes to a new aggregation, which is rebirth. Nirvana is the state that marks the end of this consciousness continuum and the associated karmic cycle of suffering through rebirths and redeaths.\n\nIn traditional Buddhist cosmology the rebirth, also called reincarnation or metempsychosis, can be in any of six realms. These are called the \"Gati\" in cycles of re-becoming, \"Bhavachakra\". The six realms of rebirth include three good realms – Deva (heavenly, god), Asura (demigod), Manusya (human); and three evil realms – Tiryak (animals), Preta (ghosts), and Naraka (hellish). The realm of rebirth is conditioned by the karma (deeds, intent) of current and previous lives; good karmas will yield a happier rebirth into good realm, bad karmas is believed to produce rebirth which is more unhappy and evil .\n\nThe release from this endless cycle of rebirths, rebecoming and redeaths is called nirvana (nibbana) in Buddhism, and achievement of nirvana is the ultimate goal of Buddhist teaching. However, much of traditional Buddhist practice has been centered on gaining merit and merit transfer, whereby an individual gains rebirth for oneself or one's family members in the good realms, and avoids rebirth in the evil realms.\n\nAncient Buddhists as well as some moderns cite the reports of the Buddha and his disciples of having gained direct knowledge into their own past lives as well as those of other beings through a kind of parapsychological ability or extrasensory perception (termed \"abhiñña\"). Likewise, Buddhist philosophers have defended the concept of special yogic perception (\"yogipratyakṣa\") which is able to empirically verify the truth of rebirth.\n\nModern Buddhists have also pointed to parapsychological phenomena as possible empirical evidence for rebirth, mainly near-death experiences, past life regression, reincarnation research and xenoglossy.\n\nBesides defending the status of the Buddha as an epistemically authoritative or reliable person (\"pramāṇa puruṣa\"), Indian Buddhist philosophers like Dignaga (c. 480–540 CE) and Dharmakirti (fl. c. 6th or 7th century), as well as later commentators on their works, also put forth philosophical arguments in favor of rebirth and especially directed against the reductionist materialist philosophy of the Carvaka school. To defend rebirth, Dharmakirti initially focuses on refuting the materialist doctrine of the Carvaka school, which held that the support (\"asraya\") for cognition is the body and that when the body is destroyed, cognition is destroyed.\n\nAccording to Richard P. Hayes, Dharmakirti denied that mental events were a mere byproduct of the body, instead holding that \"both mental events and physical events can be seen as effects of the same set of causal conditions.\" For Dharmakirti, all events are dependent on multiple causes, and they must be preceded by an \"antecendent causal condition\" of the same class. This means that all mental events \"must have\" a previous mental event as part of its causal nexus (presumably stretching back before one's birth). According to Hayes, Dharmakirti holds therefore that \"both physical factors and nonphysical factors play a role in the formation of mental events\", if not there would be no difference between sentient beings and inanimate matter. Eli Franco mentions that for Dharmakirti, the position that cognition \"can arise from the body alone, independent of their similar causes\" at the moment of birth is irrational. That is, if the mind is not being conditioned by a previous cognitive event, then it cannot arise from inert matter. Dharmakirti also argues that mental events can causally condition physical events, and thus there is no reason to privilege matter as being primary. According to Martin Willson, this kind of argument is the most commonly used in the Tibetan philosophical tradition to establish the truth of rebirth and in its most simple form can be put as follows: With respect to the knowing (consciousness or mind) of an ordinary being just born: it is preceded by earlier knowing; because it is knowing.Willson notes that this relies on two further assumptions, the first is that any mental continuum must have previous causes, the second is that materialism is false and that mind cannot emerge solely from matter (emergentism). Because of this, Indian Buddhist philosophers who argued in this way attempted to disprove the theories of materialists (Carvaka).\n\nTheravada Abhidhamma makes a similar argument. According to the Abhidhamma teacher Nina van Gorkom, physical and mental events (\"dhammas\") both depend on each other and on previous events of the same category (i.e. mental events must also be conditioned by previous mental events, and so on). In Abhidhamma, the mental event (\"citta\") which arises at the first moment of life is called the rebirth consciousness or \"patisandhi-citta.\" According to van Gorkom, \"there isn’t any citta which arises without conditions, the \"patisandhi-citta\" must also have conditions. The \"patisandhi-citta\" is the first \"citta\" of a new life and thus its cause can only be in the past.\"\n\nVarious Buddhists and interpreters of the Buddhist texts such as David Kalupahana and Etienne Lamotte, have argued that the Buddha is a kind of pragmatist regarding truth, and that he saw truths as important only when they were soteriologically useful. Thus, the Buddhist position on rebirth could be defended on pragmatic grounds instead of empirical or logical grounds. Some modern Buddhists have taken this position.\n\nThe American monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu has argued for the acceptance of the Buddhist idea of rebirth as a type of pragmatic wager argument (Pali: \"apaṇṇaka\", \"safe bet\" or \"guarantee\"). Thanissaro argues that \"the Buddha stated that it's a safe wager to assume that actions bear results that can affect not only this lifetime for also lifetimes after this than it is to assume the opposite.\" Thanissaro cites Majjhima Nikaya 60 (\"Apaṇṇaka sutta\") where the Buddha says that if there is an afterlife, those who perform bad actions have \"made a bad throw twice\" (because they are harmed in this world and in the next) while those who perform good actions will not, and thus he calls his teaching a \"safe-bet teaching\". According to Thanissaro:The Buddha's main pragmatic argument is that if one accepted his teachings, one would be likely to pay careful attention to one's actions, so as to do no harm. This in and of itself is a worthy activity regardless of whether the rest of the path was true. When applying this argument to the issue of rebirth and karmic results, the Buddha sometimes coupled it with a second pragmatic argument that resembles Pascal's wager: If one practices the Dhamma, one leads a blameless life in the here-and-now. Even if the afterlife and karmic results do not exist, one has not lost the wager, for the blamelessness of one's life is a reward in and of itself. If there is an afterlife with karmic results, then one has won a double reward: the blamelessness of one's life here and now, and the good rewards of one's actions in the afterlife. These two pragmatic arguments form the central message of this sutta.Sri Lankan Buddhist philosopher K.N. Jayatilleke writes that the Buddha's \"wager argument\" in MN 60 is that a rational person (\"viññu puriso\") would reason as follows:\n\nThe Kalama Sutta also contains a similar wager argument towards rebirth, called the \"four assurances\" or \"four consolations\".\n\nThe rebirth theories in different traditions within Hinduism rely on their foundational assumption that soul exists (Atman, attā), in contrast to Buddhist assumption that there is no soul. Hindu traditions consider soul to be the unchanging eternal essence of a living being, and in many of its theistic and non-theistic traditions the soul asserted to be identical with Brahman, the ultimate reality. Thus while both Buddhism and Hinduism accept the karma and rebirth doctrine, and both focus on ethics in this life as well as liberation from rebirth and suffering as the ultimate spiritual pursuit, they have a very different view on whether a self or soul exists, which impacts the details of their respective rebirth theories.\n\nRebirth and karma doctrine in Jainism differ from those in Buddhism, even though both are non-theistic Sramana traditions. Jainism, in contrast to Buddhism, accepts the foundational assumption that soul exists (\"Jiva\") and is involved in the rebirth mechanism. Further, Jainism considers that the rebirth has a start, that rebirth and redeath cycle is a part of a progression of a soul, karmic dust particles emanate from ethical or unethical intent and actions, these karmic particles stick to the soul which determines the next birth. Jainism, further asserts that some souls can never achieve liberation, that ethical living such as Ahimsa (non-violence) and asceticism are means to liberation for those who can attain liberation, and that liberated souls reach the eternal \"siddha\" (enlightened state) that ends their rebirth cycles. Jainism, like Buddhism, also believes in realms of birth and is symbolized by its emblematic Swastika sign, with ethical and moral theories of its lay practices focussing on obtaining good rebirth.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8324473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8324473", "title": "Regression (psychology)", "text": "Regression (psychology)\n\nRegression (), according to psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, is a defense mechanism leading to the temporary or long-term reversion of the ego to an earlier stage of development rather than handling unacceptable impulses in a more adaptive way. The defense mechanism of regression, in psychoanalytic theory, occurs when an individual's personality reverts to an earlier stage of development, adopting more childish mannerisms.\n\nFreud saw development, fixation, and regression as centrally formative elements in the creation of a neurosis. Arguing that 'the libidinal function goes through a lengthy development', he assumed that 'a development of this kind involves two dangers - first, of \"inhibition\", and secondly, of \"regression\" '. Inhibitions produced fixations; and the 'stronger the fixations on its path of development, the more readily will the function evade external difficulties by regressing to the fixations'.\n\nNeurosis for Freud was thus the product of a flight from an unsatisfactory reality 'along the path of involution, of regression, of a return to earlier phases of sexual life, phases from which at one time satisfaction was not withheld. This regression appears to be a twofold one: a \"temporal\" one, in so far as the libido, the erotic needs, hark back to stages of development that are earlier in time, and a \"formal\" one, in that the original and primitive methods of psychic expression are employed in manifesting those needs'.\n\nBehaviors associated with regression can vary greatly depending upon which stage the person is fixated at:\nAn individual fixated at the oral stage might begin eating or smoking excessively, or might become very verbally aggressive.\nA fixation at the anal stage might result in excessive tidiness or messiness. Freud recognised that 'it is possible for several fixations to be left behind in the course of development, and each of these may allow an irruption of the libido that has been pushed off - beginning, perhaps, with the later acquired fixations, and going on, as the lifestyle develops, to the original ones'.\n\nErnst Kris supplements Freud's general formulations with a specific notion of \"regression in the service of the ego\"...the specific means whereby preconscious and unconscious material appear in the creator's consciousness'. Kris thus opened the way for ego psychology to take a more positive view of regression. Carl Jung had earlier argued that 'the patient's regressive tendency...is not just a relapse into infantilism, but an attempt to get at something necessary...the universal feeling of childhood innocence, the sense of security, of protection, of reciprocated love, of trust'. Kris however was concerned rather to differentiate the way that 'Inspiration -...in which the ego controls the primary process and puts it into its service - needs to be contrasted with the opposite...condition, in which the ego is overwhelmed by the primary process'.\n\nNevertheless his view of regression in the service of the ego could be readily extended into a quasi-Romantic image of the creative process, in which 'it is only in the fiery storm of a profound regression, in the course of which the personality undergoes both dissolution of structure and reorganization, that the genius becomes capable of wresting himself from the traditional pattern that he had been forced to integrate through the identifications necessitated and enforced by the oedipal constellation'.\n\nFrom there it was perhaps only a small step to the 1960s valorisation of regression as a positive good in itself. 'In this particular type of journey, the direction we have to take is \"back\" and \"in\"...They will say we are regressed and withdrawn and out of contact with them. True enough, we have a long, long way to back to contact the reality'. Jungians had however already warned that 'romantic regression meant a surrender to the non-rational side which had to be paid for by a sacrifice of the rational and individual side'; and Freud for his part had dourly noted that 'this extraordinary plasticity of mental developments is not unrestricted in direction; it may be described as a special capacity for involution - regression - since it may well happen that a later and higher level of development, once abandoned, cannot be reached again'.\n\nAnna Freud (1936) ranked regression first in her enumeration of the defense mechanisms', and similarly suggested that people act out behaviors from the stage of psychosexual development in which they are fixated. For example, an individual fixated at an earlier developmental stage might cry or sulk upon hearing unpleasant news.\n\nMichael Balint distinguishes between two types of regression: a nasty \"malignant\" regression that the Oedipal level neurotic is prone to... and the \"benign\" regression of the basic-fault patient. The problem then is what the analyst can do 'to ensure that his patient's regression should be therapeutic and any danger of a pathological regression avoided'.\n\nOthers have highlighted the technical dilemmas of dealing with regression from different if complementary angles. On the one hand, making premature 'assumptions about the patient's state of regression in the therapy...regarded as still at the breast', for example, might block awareness of more adult functioning on the patient's part: of \"the patient's view of the therapist\" '. The opposite mistake would be 'justifying a retreat from regressive material presented by a patient. When a patient begins to trust the analyst or therapist it will be just such disturbing aspects of the internal world that will be presented for understanding - not for a panic retreat by the therapist'.\n\nPeter Blos suggested that 'revisiting of early psychic positions...helps the adolescent come out of the family envelope', and that 'Regression during adolescence thus advances the cause of development'. Stanley Olinick speaks of 'regression in the service of the other' on the part of the analyst 'during his or her clinical work. Such ego regression is a pre-condition for empathy'.\n\n"}
{"id": "171409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171409", "title": "Roussillon", "text": "Roussillon\n\nRoussillon ( or ; ; , ) is one of the historical counties of the former Principality of Catalonia, corresponding roughly to the present-day southern French \"département\" of Pyrénées-Orientales (Eastern Pyrenees) save Fenouillèdes. It may also refer to \"Northern Catalonia\" () or \"French Catalonia\", the first used by Catalan-speakers and the second used by French-speakers. A 1998 survey found that 34% of respondents stated they speak Catalan, and a further 21% understand it.\n\nIts name is derived from Ruscino (Rosceliona, Castel Rossello), a small fortified place near modern-day Perpignan where Gaulish chieftains met to consider Hannibal's request for a conference. The region formed part of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis from 121 BC to AD 462, when it was ceded with the rest of Septimania to the Visigoth Theodoric II. His successor, Amalaric, on his defeat by Clovis I in 531, retired to Hispania, leaving a governor in Septimania.\n\nIn 719, the Saracens crossed the Pyrenees and maintained political hegemony of Septimania until their final defeat in 759 by Pepin the Short, who went on to occupy Roussillon after conquering Narbonne. Roussillon was occupied by the Carolingians in 760. On the invasion of Hispania in 778, Charlemagne found the Marca Hispanica wasted by war and the inhabitants settled in the mountains. He granted some lands in the plains to Visigothic refugees from Moorish Hispania and founded several monasteries. In 792, the Saracens again invaded France, but they were repulsed by Count Guillaume of Toulouse - regent of the child Louis the Pious, King of Aquitaine - whose hegemony extended into Catalonia.\n\nThe different portions of his kingdom in time grew into allodial fiefs and, in 893, Sunyer II became the first hereditary Count of Roussillon. But his rule only extended over the eastern part of what became the later province. The western part, the Cerdanya (French, Cerdagne), was ruled in 900 by Miró as first count, and one of his grandsons, Bernat, became the first hereditary count of the middle portion, or Besalú. The Counts of Roussillon were allied to their cousins the Counts of Empúries in a centuries-long conflict with the surrounding great nobles. Count Girard I participated in the First Crusade in the following of Raymond IV of Toulouse, and was one of the first to set foot in Jerusalem when it was stormed by the Crusaders in 1099. At the beginning of the 12th century, the prestige of the Counts of Barcelona began to rise to such a height that the Counts of Roussillon had no choice but to swear fealty to them.\n\nIn 1111, Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, inherited the fief of Besalú, to which was added in 1117 Cerdanya. The possession of Roussillon by its last count, Girard II, was challenged by his illegitimate brothers. To ensure that his brothers would not inherit his territories, in his will Girard II left all his lands to Alfonso II of Aragon, who took possession in 1172. Under the Aragonese monarchs, economic and demographic growth of the region continued, and Collioure (), the port of Perpignan, became an important locus of Mediterranean trade.\n\nAs the French and Spanish crowns grew in power, the region of Roussillon, forming part of the border between them, was frequently a site of military conflict. By the Treaty of Corbeil (1258), Louis IX of France formally surrendered sovereignty over Roussillon and his claim to the title of Count of Barcelona to the Crown of Aragon, recognizing a centuries-old reality.\n\nJames I of Aragon had wrested the Balearic Isles from the Moors and joined these islands with Roussillon to create the Kingdom of Majorca, with its capital at Perpignan. In 1276, James I granted this kingdom to his son, who became James II. The subsequent disputes of this monarch with his brother Peter III were exploited by Philip III of France in his quarrel with Peter III for the crown of the Two Sicilies. Philip III espoused James II's cause and led an army into Aragon but, retreating, died at Perpignan in 1285. Lacking the resources to continue the struggle, James then became reconciled to his brother Peter, and in 1311 the former was succeeded by his son Sanç I, or Sancho I, who founded the cathedral of Perpignan shortly before his death in 1324. His successor, James III of Majorca, refused to do homage to Philip VI of France for the seigneury of Montpellier, and applied to Peter IV of Aragon for aid. Peter not only refused, but declared war and seized Majorca and Roussillon in 1344.\n\nThe province was now reunited to the Crown of Aragon, and it enjoyed peace until 1462. In that year, the disputes between John II of Aragon and his son over the Crown of Navarre spurred Louis XI of France to support John against his subjects, who had risen in revolt. The province, having been pledged as collateral to Louis for 300,000 crowns, was occupied by French troops until 1493, when Charles VIII evacuated the region as part of a settlement with the Catholic Monarchs (Isabel I of the Crown of Castile and Ferdinand II of the Crown of Aragon, they were second-cousins, creators of the Trastamara dynasty that ruled over the two Crowns).\n\nDuring a subsequent war between France and the Trastamara dynasty (1496–1498), the people suffered equally from the Castilian garrisons and the French invaders.\n\nThe Habsburg dynasty took control of both the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1516 and the two crowns were for the first time ruled by the same physical person. This was under Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (called Charles I of Spain), grandson of the Catholic Monarchs.\n\nThe dislike caused by the Castilians during the Trastamara rule was effaced in the pride of sharing the glory of the Emperor Charles I of Spain. When Perpignan was besieged by the forces of Henry, Dauphin of France in 1542, the inhabitants were loyal to Charles V. Perpignan earned the royal sobriquet of \"Fedelissima\" (\"Most Faithful City\").\n\nWhen the Catalans rose against the Spanish Crown in 1641, Louis XIII of France entered the conflict on the side of the former. After a protracted war, the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) secured Roussillon and part of the Cerdanya (Cerdagne) to the French crown, creating the French province of Roussillon.\n\nThe next fifty years saw a concerted effort by Louis XIV both to ensure the political allegiance of his new subjects and to alter their cultural identity. He was successful in the former but failed in the latter. Outside the capital of Perpignan, Roussillon remained distinctly Catalan in outlook and culture until the late nineteenth century, when industrialization began to replace Catalan identity with French.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the Ancien Régime province of Roussillon was abolished and a new department, the Department of Pyrénées-Orientales, was created instead. This department corresponds roughly to the old Roussillon, with the addition of the comarca of Fenouillèdes. Pyrénées-Orientales is the name by which this department is officially known in France. The old name of Roussillon did contribute to the French \"région\" of Languedoc-Roussillon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5009118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5009118", "title": "Social Distance Corollary", "text": "Social Distance Corollary\n\nThe Social Distance Corollary is a theory in communication research that concerns the tendency of people to perceive others to be more susceptible to media influence than they actually are.\n\nThis tendency is at the heart of the third-person effect, a phenomenon first defined and investigated by Davison (1983). Since then, much research has born out Davidson’s (1983) statement that “in the view of those trying to evaluate the effects of communication, its greatest impact will not be on “me” or “you,” but on “them”—the third persons.” Although “me” and “you” are put in one category, it is implied that some degree of distance exists between self and such close others as friends and lovers (Tsfati & Cohen, 2004). More explicit remoteness exists between “me” and ”you” as a single unit and “them,” or others.\n\nThe notion of social distance was first introduced by the sociologist Emory Bogardus (1925), who referred to it as the degrees of understanding and feeling that people experience regarding each other. Considering the social distance phenomenon an aspect of Davison’s (1983) third-person perception, Perloff (1993) articulated it as a complex variable including perceived similarity, familiarity, and identification, and pointed that there are at least two different ways to conceptualize social distance. First, social distance is a continuum going from “just like me” to “not at all like me.” Second, social distance reflects the heterogeneity and size of the audience. Perloff (1993), reviewing 16 studies of the third-person effect, acknowledged that the phenomenon is magnified when the hypothetical others are defined in broad terms. Thus, in Perloff’s (2002) terms, social distance corollary is “the notion that self-other disparities grow in magnitude with increases in perceived distance between self and comparison others.” \n\nThe social distance corollary is not dependent on whether there are media effects or not; rather, it is a perceptual phenomenon. To measure estimates of effects on self and others, Brosius and Engel (1996) constructed a questionnaire comprising three independent variables: First person; Third person, close distance; and Third person, remote distance. In other words, Brosius and Engel varied psychological distance and found that perceived effects were greater for “remote” others. Also it was found that third-person effects reveal itself most strongly among people of higher age and education. \n\nCohen, Mutz, Price, and Gunther (1988) found that Stanford students perceived media effects to be less on themselves than on other Stanford students; also, other Californians were considered to be more susceptible to media impact than “other Stanford students.” A similar study (Gunther, 1991) was done at the University of Minnesota, and the social distance phenomenon was supported. As groups became more broadly defined (other University of Minnesota students, other Minnesota residents), participants’ perception of media effects on the groups increased. \n\nInvestigating the third-person effect in regard to political identification, Duck, Hogg, and Terry (1995) found that perception of self-other differences in media vulnerability are influenced by the subjectively salient social relationship between self and other, and are governed by motivational needs, such as self-esteem, social-identity, and differentiation from others. Other researchers (e.g., Burger, 1981; Schlenker & Miller, 1977) suggested that self-serving biases consider close friends and relatives as an extension of self, whereas such a vague category as “other” might evoke stereotypes in people’s minds (Perloff & Fetzer, 1986). \n\nAfter several studies, the notion of social distance was enshrined as the “social distance corollary” (Meirick, 2005). According to Perloff’s review (1999), of the 11 studies that have tested the social-distance notion, 9 confirmed it, articulating this phenomenon as “another factor on which the strength of the third-person effect hinges.”\n\n"}
{"id": "26077118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26077118", "title": "Southern Student Organizing Committee", "text": "Southern Student Organizing Committee\n\nThe Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC) was a student activist group in the southern United States during the 1960s, which focused on many political and social issues including: African-American civil rights, opposition to the Vietnam War, worker's rights, and feminism. It was intended, in part, to be SDS for Southerners and SNCC for white students at a time when it was dangerous for SDS to attempt to organize in the Deep South and when SNCC was starting to discuss expelling white volunteers. It was felt that students at the traditionally white and black colleges in the South could be more effectively organized separately than in an integrated student civil rights organization; however, this was controversial and initially opposed by advisors like Anne Braden. Sue Thrasher and Archie Allen of the Christian Action Fellowship were among the founders of the group, with the support of Bob Moses and others. At its inception, the group had close ties to controversial Louisville, Kentucky radicals Carl and Anne Braden and their organization, the Southern Conference Education Fund, but a deliberate effort was later made to put some distance between the SSOC and the Bradens to avoid the appearance that the SSOC was a Communist front.\n\nAfter its founding, SSOC came to be formally tied to the SDS as a fraternal organization with a regional mandate in the South, and joint SDS-SSOC chapters existed at some schools like the University of North Carolina. A monthly organ,\"The New South Student\", was published on a regular basis. In 1967, SSOC organizers led by Gene Guerrero and Lynn Wells, worked with TWUA on a unionization drive in North Carolina textile mills, involving more than 300 students in the campaign. In 1968, Gene Guerrero and Howard Romaine were among the SSOC activists involved in founding Atlanta's widely circulated underground newspaper, The Great Speckled Bird.\n\nSSOC considered itself a distinctly Southern organization and sometimes embraced traditional Confederate symbols and language. In 1968, SSOC staged a series of antiwar protests called \"Southern Days of Secession,\" in which they urged Southerners to \"secede\" from the Vietnam War. The SSOC button was a Confederate flag with black and white hands shaking in front of it. The hands were modeled on a handshake between SSOC organizer Archie Allen and SNCC chairman John Lewis. It was designed by an artist on the SNCC staff.\n\nSSOC had an extensive literature program, printing thousands of copies of pamphlets on civil rights, the Vietnam war, poverty and campus reform that were sold on campus literature tables across the south. The bestseller was entitled \"Vietnam: The Myth and Reality of American Policy.\" During the school year, it published a monthly magazine called The New South Student, copies now sell for a high premium on the internet. One of the magazine's features was a series called \"The Roots of Southern Radicalism\", which featured stories on historic predecessors of SSOC back to slave revolts, the American revolution, the abolition movement, the Populists, the union organizing drives of the 1930s, and institutions and organizations like Highlander Center, Koinonia Farms, and the Southern Conference for Human Welfare. SSOC also organized a conference in Atlanta on Radical Southern History.\n\nSSOC had four chairmen during its five-year history: Gene Guerrero, Howard Romaine, Steve Wise, and Tom Gardner. During its last year, it changed the post to two secretaries, Mike Welch and Lyn Wells, and added a newspaper called The Phoenix, to SSOC's list of publications.\n\nSSOC leased the historic camp at Buckeye Cove in Swannanoa, North Carolina from the Fellowship of Southern Churchmen and held many conferences there. SSOC conferences had a variety of topics but were a way for southern activists, who often felt isolated on the conservative and largely segregated campuses of the time to meet like-minded students from other places and draw strength and inspiration from their activities.\n\nThrough a traveling teach-in on Vietnam and American foreign policy that toured southern states between 1967 and 1969, SSOC helped to organize the antiwar movement in the south. The appearance of SSOC delegations at national antiwar marches always resulted in enthusiastic applause.\n\nFor some Southern schools, even though SSOC had a presence, the numbers were so small in comparison to the size of the student bodies that it could not gain traction as anything but protest theatre. For example, SSOC organizers came to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, connected with a few individuals and left buttons and flyers with them and then departed. Of the 26,000 students on campus, only about ten were recruited.\n\nEarly in 1969 these individuals gathered in a highly resonant hallway and staged an \"organizational meeting\". On audiotape it sounded like hundreds were attending and a motion was made to follow SDS's example at Columbia University and take over the campus Administration building the next day.\n\nThe tape was \"leaked\" to the Administration of U.T. and, to the surprise of the participants, the next morning the campus was flooded with police, the windows of the Administration building were shuttered with wooden boards, and a truck was backed up to the doorway blocking entry while keeping the Administration locked inside. One of the members volunteered to brandish a toy water-pistol machine gun and parade back and forth in front of the building. Everyone else stayed out of sight. The individual was arrested and subsequently released. Nothing more happened.\n\nOver time, radicals in SDS increasingly saw SSOC as too liberal and too timid. SSOC finally dissolved itself in 1969 as the result of an internal struggle with members of Progressive Labor, a Maoist sect, after members of PL had successfully passed a resolution at an SDS convention condemning SSOC's \"anachronistic\" regionalism and breaking the ties between the organizations.\n\nThe breakup of SSOC came in 1969, the same year that its counterpart New Left Organizations, SNCC and SDS, collapsed—in part because of the COINTELPRO efforts, but in larger part because the movement had grown so widespread that the organizational forms of the early 1960s were no longer able to handle it. What SSOC organizer Ed Hamlett called \"the radical beer-drinking five\" on southern campuses became the long-haired pot-smoking hundreds (or thousands), and instead of getting ideas from mimeographed pamphlets, they could turn on the nightly news and see massive demonstrations and dramatic trials like those of the Chicago 7.\n\nIn the bitterness following the breakup of SSOC, the organization's papers were taken and burned, lest they fall into the hands of the FBI. This also threatened the memory of the organization and its efforts with becoming historically extinct. However, in the 1990s, a graduate student at the University of Virginia, Gregg Michel, decided to write his dissertation on SSOC and began contacting and interviewing old activists, and organized a reunion of them in Charlottesville, VA in 1994. It turned out that many people had saved SSOC material, and were willing to donate them to an archive that was established at the University of Virginia Library. Michel's dissertation was published as \"Struggle for a Better South\" in 2004 and the memory of the organization was brought back from the brink of historic oblivion. The book was launched with a panel at the American Studies Association convention in Atlanta in 2004 that brought together many SSOC and SNCC activists (including all four SSOC chairmen).\n\nAfter the breakup of SSOC, two former members, Howard Romaine and Sue Thrasher, were instrumental in forming the Institute for Southern Studies with Julian Bond.\n\nRaymond Luc Levasseur, later the leader of the United Freedom Front, worked with the SSOC.\n\n"}

{"id": "1241988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1241988", "title": "System of measurement", "text": "System of measurement\n\nA system of measurement is a collection of units of measurement and rules relating them to each other. Systems of measurement have historically been important, regulated and defined for the purposes of science and commerce. Systems of measurement in modern use include the metric system, the imperial system, and United States customary units.\n\nThe French Revolution gave rise to the metric system, and this has spread around the world, replacing most customary units of measure. In most systems, length (distance), mass, and time are \"base quantities\".\n\nLater science developments showed that either electric charge or electric current could be added to extend the set of base quantities by which many other metrological units could be easily defined. (However, electrical units are not necessary for such a set. Gaussian units, for example, have only length, mass, and time as base quantities, and the ampere is defined in terms of other units.) Other quantities, such as power and speed, are derived from the base set: for example, speed is distance per unit time. Historically a wide range of units was used for the same type of quantity: in different contexts, length was measured in inches, feet, yards, fathoms, rods, chains, furlongs, miles, nautical miles, stadia, leagues, with conversion factors which were not powers of ten. Such arrangements were satisfactory in their own contexts.\n\nThe preference for a more universal and consistent system (based on more rational base units) only gradually spread with the growth of science. Changing a measurement system has substantial financial and cultural costs which must be offset against the advantages to be obtained from using a more rational system. However pressure built up, including from scientists and engineers for conversion to a more rational, and also internationally consistent, basis of measurement.\n\nIn antiquity, \"systems of measurement\" were defined locally: the different units might be defined independently according to the length of a king's thumb or the size of his foot, the length of stride, the length of arm, or maybe the weight of water in a keg of specific size, perhaps itself defined in \"hands\" and \"knuckles\". The unifying characteristic is that there was some definition based on some standard. Eventually \"cubits\" and \"strides\" gave way to \"customary units\" to meet the needs of merchants and scientists.\n\nIn the metric system and other recent systems, a single basic unit is used for each base quantity. Often secondary units (multiples and submultiples) are derived from the basic units by multiplying by powers of ten, i.e. by simply moving the decimal point. Thus the basic metric unit of length is the metre; a distance of 1.234 m is 1,234 millimetres, or 0.001234 kilometres.\n\nMetrication is complete or nearly complete in almost all countries. US customary units are heavily used in the United States and to some degree in Liberia. Traditional Burmese units of measurement are used in Burma. U.S. units are used in limited contexts in Canada due to the large volume of trade; there is also considerable use of Imperial weights and measures, despite \"de jure\" Canadian conversion to metric.\n\nA number of other jurisdictions have laws mandating or permitting other systems of measurement in some or all contexts, such as the United Kingdom – whose road signage legislation, for instance, only allows distance signs displaying imperial units (miles or yards) – or Hong Kong.\n\nIn the United States, metric units are used almost universally in science, widely in the military, and partially in industry, but customary units predominate in household use. At retail stores, the liter is a commonly used unit for volume, especially on bottles of beverages, and milligrams, rather than grains, are used for medications. Some other standard non-SI units are still in international use, such as nautical miles and knots in aviation and shipping.\n\nMetric systems of units have evolved since the adoption of the first well-defined system in France in 1795. During this evolution the use of these systems has spread throughout the world, first to non-English-speaking countries, and then to English speaking countries.\n\nMultiples and submultiples of metric units are related by powers of ten and their names are formed with prefixes. This relationship is compatible with the decimal system of numbers and it contributes greatly to the convenience of metric units.\n\nIn the early metric system there were two base units, the metre for length and the gram for mass. The other units of length and mass, and all units of area, volume, and derived units such as density were derived from these two base units.\n\nMesures usuelles (French for \"customary measurements\") were a system of measurement introduced as a compromise between the metric system and traditional measurements. It was used in France from 1812 to 1839.\n\nA number of variations on the metric system have been in use. These include gravitational systems, the centimetre–gram–second systems (cgs) useful in science, the metre–tonne–second system (mts) once used in the USSR and the metre–kilogram–second system (mks).\n\nThe current international standard metric system is the International System of Units (\"Système international d'unités\" or SI) It is an mks system based on the metre, kilogram and second as well as the kelvin, ampere, candela, and mole.\n\nThe SI includes two classes of units which are defined and agreed internationally. The first of these classes includes the seven SI base units for length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, luminous intensity and amount of substance. The second class consists of the SI derived units. These derived units are defined in terms of the seven base units. All other quantities (e.g. work, force, power) are expressed in terms of SI derived units.\n\nBoth imperial units and US customary units derive from earlier English units. Imperial units were mostly used in the former British Empire and the British Commonwealth, but in all these countries they have been largely supplanted by the metric system. They are still used for some applications in the United Kingdom but have been mostly replaced by the metric system in commercial, scientific, and industrial applications.\nUS customary units, however, are still the main system of measurement in the United States. While some steps towards metrication have been made (mainly in the late 1960s and early 1970s), the customary units have a strong hold due to the vast industrial infrastructure and commercial development.\n\nWhile imperial and US customary systems are closely related, there are a number of differences between them. Units of length and area (the inch, foot, yard, mile etc.) are identical except for surveying purposes. The Avoirdupois units of mass and weight differ for units larger than a pound (lb). The imperial system uses a stone of 14 lb, a long hundredweight of 112 lb and a long ton of 2240 lb. The stone is not used in the US and the hundredweights and tons are short: 100 lb and 2000 lb respectively.\n\nWhere these systems most notably differ is in their units of volume. A US fluid ounce (fl oz), about 29.6 millilitres (ml), is slightly larger than the imperial fluid ounce (about 28.4 ml). However, as there are 16 US fl oz to a US pint and 20 imp fl oz per imperial pint, the imperial pint is about 20% larger. The same is true of quarts, gallons, etc. Six US gallons are a little less than five imperial gallons.\n\nThe Avoirdupois system served as the general system of mass and weight. In addition to this there are the Troy and the Apothecaries' systems. Troy weight was customarily used for precious metals, black powder and gemstones. The troy ounce is the only unit of the system in current use; it is used for precious metals. Although the troy ounce is larger than its Avoirdupois equivalent, the pound is smaller. The obsolete troy pound was divided into 12 ounces, rather than the 16 ounces per pound of the Avoirdupois system. The Apothecaries' system was traditionally used in pharmacology, but has now been replaced by the metric system; it shared the same pound and ounce as the troy system but with different further subdivisions.\n\nNatural units are physical units of measurement defined in terms of universal physical constants in such a manner that selected physical constants take on the numerical value of one when expressed in terms of those units. Natural units are so named because their definition relies on only properties of nature and not on any human construct. Various systems of natural units are possible.\n\nSome other examples are as follows:\n\nNon-standard measurement units, sometimes found in books, newspapers etc., include:\n\n\n\nA unit of measurement that applies to money is called a unit of account in economics and unit of measure in accounting. This is normally a currency issued by a country or a fraction thereof; for instance, the US dollar and US cent ( of a dollar), or the euro and euro cent.\n\nISO 4217 is the international standard describing three letter codes (also known as the currency code) to define the names of currencies established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nThroughout history, many official systems of measurement have been used. While no longer in official use, some of these customary systems are occasionally used in day-to-day life, for instance in cooking.\n\n\n\n"}

In physics, temporal paradoxes fall into two broad groups: consistency paradoxes exemplified by the grandfather paradox; and causal loops. More broadly, a variation of the Fermi paradox also applies to time travel.\n\nA causal loop is a paradox of time travel that occurs when a future event is the cause of a past event, which in turn is the cause of the future event. Both events then exist in spacetime, but their origin cannot be determined. A causal loop may involve an event, a person or object, or information. The terms boot-strap paradox, predestination paradox or ontological paradox are sometimes used in fiction to refer to a causal loop.\n\nThe consistency paradox or grandfather paradox occurs when the past is changed in any way, thus creating a contradiction. A time traveler \"can\" do anything that \"did\" happen, but \"can't\" do anything that \"didn't\" happen. Doing something that didn't happen results in a contradiction. Consistency paradoxes occur whenever changing the past is possible.\n\nThe Fermi paradox can be adapted for time travel, and phrased \"if time travel were possible, where are all the visitors from the future?\" Answers vary, from time travel not being possible, to the possibility that visitors from the future can not reach any arbitrary point in the past, or that they disguise themselves to avoid detection.\n\n"}

As \"the religion of pity\", it elevates the weak over the strong, exalting that which is \"ill-constituted and weak\" at the expense of that which is full of life and vitality.\n\nNietzsche compares Christianity to Buddhism. He posits that Christianity is \"the struggle against sin\", whereas Buddhism is \"the struggle against suffering\"; to Nietzsche, Christianity limits and lowers humankind by assailing its natural and inevitable instincts as depraved (\"sin\"), whereas Buddhism advises one merely to eschew suffering. While Christianity is full of \"revengefulness\" and \"antipathy\" (e.g., the Last Judgment), Buddhism promotes \"benevolence, being kind, as health-promoting.\" Buddhism is also suggested to be the more \"honest\" of the two religions, for its being strictly \"phenomenalistic\", and because \"Christianity makes a thousand promises but \"keeps none\".\" Martyrdom, rather than being a moral high ground or position of strength, is indicative of an \"\"obtuseness\" to the question of truth.\"\n\nSimilarly, Nietzsche contrasts 19th-century European morality to that of pre-Christian Greek civilization. Because sex is, in Nietzsche's thought, a fundamental affirmation of life, for its being the very process by which human life is created, Christianity's elevation of chastity (including, for example, the story of Mary's virginal pregnancy) is counter to the natural instincts of humanity, and therefore a contradiction of \"natural values\".\n\nNietzsche's enthusiasm for what he called \"transvaluation\" stemmed from his contempt for Christianity and the entirety of the moral system that flowed from it: indeed, \"contempt of man\", as Nietzsche states near the end of \"The Antichrist\". Nietzsche perceived the moral framework of Christian civilization to be oppressive: \n\nTransvaluation would mean the exaltation of life rather than the exaltation of suffering, and an acceptance of every instinct or lust as organic and therefore valid, and so beyond the scope of moral condemnation. What one desires would be merely what one desires, rather than either sinful or pious. What one desires would be the product of stimuli rather than the product of \"will\".\n\n\"The Revaluation of All Values\" was also the working title of a series of four books Nietzsche was planning to write, only the first of which—\"The Antichrist\"—he ever completed. However, one of his schemas for \"The Will to Power\" used \"The Revaluation of All Values\" as a subtitle, and it was this scheme that his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche used to assemble his notes into the final book with that title.\n"}

This applies to the rights of Alaska Natives and Native Americans in the United States and First Nations in Canada, as well as to a smaller number of Inuit and Metis in Canada who have entered into treaties.\n\nTreaty rights are not the only rights claimed by indigenous peoples. Indigenous people claim inherent rights to self-determination, which implies that they be recognized as rights-bearing groups (called \"tribes\", \"bands\", or \"nations\" depending on the place and time) capable of self-determination and cultural survival. Once the state recognizes that there is another body corporate with legal personality capable of making binding agreements on behalf of its members, then negotiations can begin for mutual exchange and aid: a treaty. The earliest of these agreements, between colonial powers such the French, British, and the Dutch and various indigenous peoples of the Atlantic coastal regions had the character of military alliances, as between peers. Later treaties, however, were generally about the cession of land from weakened Aboriginal peoples to expanding settler states. By the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British Crown (i.e. the state) declared that individual British subjects could not buy land from native nations; only the Crown could obtain land from native nations through treaty, which it could then redistribute to individuals. This principle, which was adopted by both Canada and the United States upon gaining independence from Britain, became the legal impetus for all subsequent treaties in North America.\n\nBy signing treaties, indigenous peoples traded vast amounts of their land and resources in exchange for reserved areas of land (Indian reservations [US terminology] and Indian reserves [Canadian terminology]) and things like protection (from attacks on their lands), health care, , and religious freedom, protection of hunting and fishing rights, and sometimes some monies as well. Because Article Six of the United States Constitution declares treaties to be the supreme law of the land, treaties are just as valid today as they were the day they were signed, and treaty rights are still legally binding as well. Likewise treaty rights were enshrined in Canada under section 35 by the package of constitutional reforms of 1982.\n\nA common critique of the treaty relationship is that treaty rights are \"special\" rights given to indigenous people by the state because of their racial status. Defenders of the treaty system argue however, that the government does not \"give\" treaty rights to anyone – native people reserved them when they signed treaties in a government-to-government relationship.\n\nTreaty rights are frequently subject to public debate, particularly hunting and fishing rights. Many Native nations have reserved rights to hunt and fish in their accustomed places, which are often lands that was given up at the treaty signing, or \"ceded land\". This leads to conflict with sports and commercial hunters and fishers, who are competing for the same limited resource in the same place.\n\nAnother common source of conflict is management decisions about the land or rivers on which Native people have rights. Things like dams and logging have huge effects on fish and wildlife populations. In Canadian law, government how have a court-mandated \"duty to consult\" indigenous peoples regarding the management process of these lands and rivers. In the United States, no such mandate exists.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s and extending into the early 1990s, Northern Wisconsin was rife in protests against Ojibwe spearfishing. The Voigt decision in 1983 had reaffirmed that the treaties made in 1837 and 1842 still stood. These treaties gave the Ojibwe the rights to hunt, fish, and gather off-reservation, which was not subject to state regulation. This heralded a backlash of non-Natives, who believed the Ojibwe had been granted special rights. Spearheaded by groups like Stop Treaty Abuse (STA), often violent and racially discriminatory protests against spearfishing covered boat landings across northern Wisconsin. This led to the case \"Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin\", which culminated with Judge Barbara Crabb upholding the Voigt decision and many members, donors, and politicians distancing themselves from the STA, which many believed was racist.\n\nThe right to hunt North Pacific Gray Whales has been a contentious issue for the Makah people in Washington state. The Makah people ceded much of their traditional lands in the Treaty of Neah Bay in 1855, but retained the right to whale. The tribe voluntarily gave up this practice in 1915 because of decimated Grey Whale populations, but once the species was taken off the Federal Endangered Species List in 1993, the tribe sought to continue whaling. In 1999, they killed one whale, but faced immediate backlash from environmental groups and animal rights groups. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) believed that the Makah tribe’s quota of harvesting up to five whales a year would not hurt the recovering population. Because of a number of new studies garnishing evidence for and against this practice, the issue has been tied up in court since 1999, with the tribe being unable to exercise the right given to them in the Treaty of Neah Bay.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century, the United States made a number of treaties with the then Kingdom of Hawaii, the final being in 1887. These treaties recognized the Kingdom of Hawaii as being sovereign and independent. In 1893, John L. Stevens, US minister assigned to the Kingdom of Hawaii, led a group of non-indigenous people to overthrow Queen Lili‘uokalani, which was backed by United States naval forces. They established a Provisional government, which then declared itself the Republic of Hawaii. In 1899, the US annexed Hawaii. Many Hawaiian sovereignty activists feel that because of the aforementioned treaties, Hawaii should today be its own Nation instead of part of the United States.\n\nThe Indigenous people of Standing Rock reservation in North and South Dakota believe that the Dakota Access Pipeline, which runs near their main source of water, could contaminate that source of water should it leak. The also cite the Fort Laramie Treaties of 1851 and 1868, which promised the land that DAPL runs through to the Sioux Tribe. Lands were seized in 1877 (8) and 1887 with the Dawes Allotment Act that broke up reservations (9). Some call for these treaties to be reinstated and enforced today, which would put the course of the DAPT straight through Sioux lands.\n"}

A common approach in monetary economics is to either require that agents hold money for institutional reasons (for example, to pay taxes, or because the government forces individuals to accept it), to enter money holdings directly into individual's utility functions (the so-called \"money in utility\" or Sidrauski model), or to impose an arbitrary Cash-in-advance constraint (the so-called Clower constraint). However all of these approaches are somewhat ad hoc and do not explain why intrinsically worthless money can have value as medium of exchange. The turnpike model of money is one of the possible resolutions of this theoretical problem.\n\n"}

C. Wren and H. Martin. Written primarily for the children of British officers residing in India, these books were widely adopted by Indian and Pakistani schools in the post-colonial era and missionary schools in Burma. The books were published in 1935, with a discussion on composition added later. The content in the books is largely based on \"The Manual of English Grammar and Composition\" by J. C. Nesfield.\n\nOther books in this series are \"Elementary English Grammar\", \"A First Book of English Grammar and Composition\", \"High School English Grammar and Composition\" and \"A Final Course of Grammar & Composition\". The series of textbooks is still in use at many Indian schools. While semantic change has dated the original books, they continue to enjoy considerable popularity and updated versions are now in common use. Copies of the different versions of this series are available online.\n"}
