{"id": "2661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2661", "title": "Affection", "text": "Affection\n\nAffection, attraction, infatuation, or fondness is a \"disposition or state of mind or body\" that is often associated with a feeling or type of love. It has given rise to a number of branches of philosophy and psychology concerning emotion, disease, influence, and state of being. \"Affection\" is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of love, amounting to more than goodwill or friendship. Writers on ethics generally use the word to refer to distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic. Some contrast it with \"passion\" as being free from the distinctively sensual element.\n\nEven a very simple demonstration of affection can have a broad variety of emotional reactions, from embarrassment to disgust to pleasure and annoyance. It also has a different physical effect on the giver and the receiver.\n\nMore specifically, the word has been restricted to emotional states, the object of which is a living thing such as a human or animal. Affection is compared with passion, from the Greek \"pathos\". As such it appears in the writings of French philosopher René Descartes, Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza, and most of the writings of early British ethicists. However, on various grounds (e.g., that it does not involve anxiety or excitement and that it is comparatively inert and compatible with the entire absence of the sensuous element), it is generally and usefully distinguished from passion. In this narrower sense, the word has played a great part in ethical systems, which have spoken of the social or parental \"affections\" as in some sense a part of moral obligations. For a consideration of these and similar problems, which depend ultimately on the degree in which the affections are regarded as voluntary.\n\nAffection can be communicated by looks, words, gestures, or touches. Affectionate behavior may have evolved from parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards. Such affection has been shown to influence brain development in infants. \nExpressions of affection can be unwelcome if they pose implied threats to one's well being. If welcomed, affectionate behavior may be associated with various health benefits. It has been proposed that positive sentiments increase the propensity of people to interact and that familiarity gained through affection increases positive sentiments among them.\n\nAffection exchange is seen as an adaptive human behavior that contributes to greater physical and mental well-being. The expression of affection mediates emotional, physical, and relational benefits for the individual and significant counterparts. The communication of positive feelings towards others has shown health benefits that include; lower stress hormones, lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure and stronger immune system. Affection Expression Benefits are internally noticed when the emotion is expressed and not merely felt, if affection is not reciprocated through the receiver, effects of the affection are still felt through the giver. \n\nAffectionate behavior is often regarded as the result of parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards. Positive and negative parental behaviors can be linked to later life health problems. Abuse is a common attribute to poor health in later life, as the lack of affection leads to naturally poorer well-being and mental health. A 2013 study, UCLA affection showed the effects of early child abuse and the outcome between lack of affection and the strong biological link for how these negative early-life experiences affect physical health. \n"}

And, as consequence, if the converse is true, and you \"do\" know the attributes, properties and/or other descriptive markers of this thing, then you shouldn't need to seek it out at all. The result of this line of thinking is that, in either instance, there is no point trying to gain that \"something\"; in the case of Plato's aforementioned work, there is no point in seeking knowledge.\n\nSocrates' response is to develop his theory of \"anamnesis\". He suggests that the soul is immortal, and repeatedly incarnated; knowledge is in the soul from eternity (86b), but each time the soul is incarnated its knowledge is forgotten in the trauma of birth. What one perceives to be learning, then, is the recovery of what one has forgotten. (Once it has been brought back it is true belief, to be turned into genuine knowledge by understanding.) And thus Socrates (and Plato) sees himself, not as a teacher, but as a midwife, aiding with the birth of knowledge that was already there in the student.\n\nThe theory is illustrated by Socrates asking a slave boy questions about geometry. At first the boy gives the wrong answer; when this is pointed out to him, he is puzzled, but by asking questions Socrates is able to help him to reach the correct answer. This is intended to show that, as the boy wasn't told the answer, he could only have reached the truth by recollecting what he had already known but forgotten.\n\nIn \"Phaedo\", Plato develops his theory of \"anamnesis\", in part by combining it with his theory of Forms. First, he elaborates how \"anamnesis\" can be achieved: whereas in \"Meno\" nothing more than Socrates' method of questioning is offered, in \"Phaedo\" Plato presents a way of living that would enable one to overcome the misleading nature of the body through \"katharsis\" (Greek: κάθαρσις; “cleansing” (from guilt or defilement), “purification”). The body and its senses are the source of error; knowledge can only be regained through the use of our reason, contemplating things with the soul (noesis) (see 66 b–d).\n\nSecondly, he makes clear that genuine knowledge, as opposed to mere true belief (doxa), is distinguished by its content. One can only know eternal truths, for they are the only truths that can have been in the soul from eternity. Though it can be very useful to have a true belief about, say, the best way to get from London to Oxford, such a belief does not qualify as knowledge; how could the human soul know such factually contingent propositions for all eternity?\n\nFor the later interpreters of Plato, \"anamnesis\" was less an epistemic assertion than an ontological one. Plotinus himself did not posit recollection in the strict sense of the term, because all knowledge of universally important ideas (logos) came from a source outside of time (Dyad or the divine nous), and was accessible, by means of contemplation, to the soul as part of noesis. They were more objects of experience, of inner knowledge or insight, than of recollection. Despite this, in Neoplatonism, the theory of \"anamnesis\" became part of the mythology of the descent of the soul.\n\nPorphyry's short work \"De Antro Nympharum\" (ostensibly a commentary on the brief passage in \"Odyssey\" 13) elucidated this notion, as did Macrobius's much longer \"Commentary on the Dream of Scipio\". The idea of psychic memory was used by Neoplatonists to demonstrate the celestial and immaterial origins of the soul, and to explain how memories of the world-soul could be recalled by everyday human beings. As such, psychic recollection was intrinsically connected to the Platonic conception of the soul itself. Since the contents of individual \"material\" or physical memories were trivial, only the universal recollection of Forms, or divine objects, drew one closer to the immortal source of being.\n\n\"Anamnesis\" is the closest that human minds can come to experiencing the freedom of the soul prior to its being encumbered by matter. The process of incarnation is described in Neoplatonism as a trauma that causes the soul to forget its experiences (and often its divine origins as well). The storyteller's voice is concealed by John and Plato in order to pursue their anamnetic efforts and to encourage the following generations to not only be readers but partakers in their original discussions on the soul. Gratitude as an example of divine salvation was expressed by offering to God the first fruits of the harvest which maintains an identity with those who performed these actions in the past and therefore actualising them in the present.\n\n"}
{"id": "272456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272456", "title": "Aspect ratio (aeronautics)", "text": "Aspect ratio (aeronautics)\n\nIn aeronautics, the aspect ratio of a wing is the ratio of its span to its mean chord. It is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing area. Thus, a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio, whereas a short, wide wing has a low aspect ratio.\n\nAspect ratio and other features of the planform are often used to predict the aerodynamic efficiency of a wing because the lift-to-drag ratio increases with aspect ratio, improving fuel economy in aircraft.\n\nThe aspect ratio formula_1 is the ratio of the square of the wingspan formula_2 to the projected wing area formula_3, which is equal to the ratio of the wingspan formula_2 to the standard mean chord formula_5:\n\nformula_6\n\nRoughly speaking, an airplane in flight can be imagined to affect a circular cylinder of air with a diameter equal to the wingspan. A large wingspan affects a large cylinder of air, and a small wingspan affects a small cylinder of air. A small air cylinder must be pushed down with a greater power (energy change per unit time) than a large cylinder in order to produce an equal upward force (momentum change per unit time). This is because giving the same momentum change to a smaller mass of air requires giving it a greater velocity change, and a much greater energy change because energy is proportional to the square of the velocity while momentum is only linearly proportional to the velocity. The aft-leaning component of this change in velocity is proportional to the induced drag, which is the force needed to take up that power at that airspeed. \n\nThe interaction between undisturbed air outside the cylinder of air, and the downward-moving cylinder of air occurs at the wingtips and can be seen as wingtip vortices.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that this is a drastic oversimplification, and an airplane wing affects a very large area around itself.\n\nAlthough a long, narrow wing with a high aspect ratio has aerodynamic advantages like better lift-to-drag-ratio (see also details below), there are several reasons why not \"all\" aircraft have high aspect wings:\n\n\n\nAircraft which approach or exceed the speed of sound sometimes incorporate variable-sweep wings. These wings give a high aspect ratio when unswept and a low aspect ratio at maximum sweep.\n\nIn subsonic flow, steeply swept and narrow wings are inefficient compared to a high-aspect-ratio wing. However, as the flow becomes transonic and then supersonic, the shock wave first generated along the wing's upper surface causes wave drag on the aircraft, and this drag is proportional to the span of the wing. Thus a long span, valuable at low speeds, causes excessive drag at transonic and supersonic speeds.\n\nBy varying the sweep the wing can be optimised for the current flight speed. However the extra weight and complexity of a moveable wing mean that it is not often used.\n\nThe aspect ratios of birds' and bats' wings vary considerably. Birds that fly long distances or spend long periods soaring such as albatrosses and eagles often have wings of high aspect ratio. By contrast, birds which require good maneuverability, such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, have wings of low aspect ratio.\n\nFor a constant-chord wing of chord \"c\" and span \"b\", the aspect ratio is given by:\n\nIf the wing is swept, \"c\" is measured parallel to the direction of forward flight.\n\nFor most wings the length of the chord is not a constant but varies along the wing, so the aspect ratio \"AR\" is defined as the square of the wingspan \"b\" divided by the wing area \"S\". In symbols,\n\nFor such a wing with varying chord, the standard mean chord \"SMC\" is defined as \n\nThe performance of aspect ratio AR related to the lift-to-drag-ratio and wingtip vortices is illustrated in the formula used to calculate the drag coefficient of an aircraft formula_12\n\nwhere\n\nThe wetted aspect ratio considers the whole wetted surface area of the airframe, formula_14, rather than just the wing. It is a better measure of the aerodynamic efficiency of an aircraft than the wing aspect ratio. It is defined as:\n\nwhere formula_2 is span and formula_14 is the wetted surface.\n\nIllustrative examples are provided by the Boeing B-47 and Avro Vulcan. Both aircraft have very similar performance although they are radically different. The B-47 has a high aspect ratio wing, while the Avro Vulcan has a low aspect ratio wing. They have, however, a very similar wetted aspect ratio.\n\n\n"}

Its purpose is to regulate assisted human reproduction (AHR) and related research. It is one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation in the world concerning reproductive technologies and related research. It was introduced and passed in 2004 and was fully in force by 2007.\n\nThe \"Act\" was meant to provide Canadians with a system of licensing, monitoring, inspection and enforcement of activities relating to AHR in order to protect and promote Canadians' health, safety and values. It identifies prohibited activities, as well as controlled activities, which are AHR activities that can be performed in Canada but require a licence and adherence to the regulations. However, a 2010 Supreme Court case that ruled that certain sections of the Act exceeded the federal government's legislative power means that the scope of the Act's regulatory framework was significantly reduced (see below).\n\nOn December 22, 2010, the Supreme Court of Canada declared some sections of the \"Assisted Human Reproduction Act\" unconstitutional. It was ruled that the sections listed below exceeded the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada under the \"Constitution Act, 1867\":\n\n\nProhibited activities, defined in sections 5 to 9 of the \"Act\", are AHR activities that Parliament has determined to be ethically unacceptable or incompatible with Canadian values, or to pose significant risks to the health, safety and values of Canadians. These activities are not allowed in Canada. Prohibitions include:\n\nThis last prohibition prevents the \"commercialization\" of human reproduction in Canada. While the \"Act\" currently allows donors and surrogate mothers to be reimbursed for legitimate expenses, Health Canada is developing specific regulations about what constitutes a legitimate expenditure.\n\nControlled activities, set out in sections 10 to 12 of the \"Act\", are AHR activities permitted if performed in accordance with regulations and by a licensed clinic or individual in licensed premises. However, section 10, which addressed the \"use of human reproductive material,\" and section 11, which addressed \"transgenics,\" were ruled \"ultra vires\". Section 12, which addresses the \"reimbursement of expenditures\" for providing gametes and surrogacy services, is \"intra vires\" but is not yet in force.\n\n"}

{"id": "4211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4211", "title": "Bootstrapping", "text": "Bootstrapping\n\nIn general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input. In computer technology the term (usually shortened to booting) usually refers to the process of loading the basic software into the memory of a computer after power-on or general reset, especially the operating system which will then take care of loading other software as needed.\n\nThe term appears to have originated in the early 19-century United States (particularly in the phrase \"pull oneself over a fence by one's bootstraps\") to mean an absurdly impossible action, an adynaton.\n\nTall boots may have a tab, loop or handle at the top known as a bootstrap, allowing one to use fingers or a boot hook tool to help pulling the boots on. The saying \"to \" was already in use during the 19 century as an example of an impossible task. The idiom dates at least to 1834, when it appeared in the \"Workingman's Advocate\": \"It is conjectured that Mr. Murphee will now be enabled to hand himself over the Cumberland river or a barn yard fence by the straps of his boots.\" In 1860 it appeared in a comment on philosophy of mind: \"The attempt of the mind to analyze itself [is] an effort analogous to one who would lift himself by his own bootstraps.\" Bootstrap as a metaphor, meaning to better oneself by one's own unaided efforts, was in use in 1922. This metaphor spawned additional metaphors for a series of self-sustaining processes that proceed without external help.\n\nThe term is sometimes attributed to a story in Rudolf Erich Raspe's \"\", but in that story Baron Munchausen pulls himself (and his horse) out of a swamp by his hair (specifically, his pigtail), not by his bootstraps and no explicit reference to bootstraps has been found elsewhere in the various versions of the Munchausen tales.\n\nBooting is the process of starting a computer, specifically with regard to starting its software. The process involves a chain of stages, in which at each stage a smaller, simpler program loads and then executes the larger, more complicated program of the next stage. It is in this sense that the computer \"pulls itself up by its bootstraps\", \"i.e.\" it improves itself by its own efforts. Booting is a chain of events that starts with execution of hardware-based procedures and may then hand-off to firmware and software which is loaded into main memory. Booting often involves processes such as performing self-tests, loading configuration settings, loading a BIOS, resident monitors, a hypervisor, an operating system, or utility software.\n\nThe computer term bootstrap began as a metaphor in the 1950s. In computers, pressing a bootstrap button caused a hardwired program to read a bootstrap program from an input unit. The computer would then execute the bootstrap program, which caused it to read more program instructions. It became a self-sustaining process that proceeded without external help from manually entered instructions. As a computing term, bootstrap has been used since at least 1953.\n\nBootstrapping can also refer to the development of successively more complex, faster programming environments. The simplest environment will be, perhaps, a very basic text editor (\"e.g.\", ed) and an assembler program. Using these tools, one can write a more complex text editor, and a simple compiler for a higher-level language and so on, until one can have a graphical IDE and an extremely high-level programming language.\n\nHistorically, bootstrapping also refers to an early technique for computer program development on new hardware. The technique described in this paragraph has been replaced by the use of a cross compiler executed by a pre-existing computer. Bootstrapping in program development began during the 1950s when each program was constructed on paper in decimal code or in binary code, bit by bit (1s and 0s), because there was no high-level computer language, no compiler, no assembler, and no linker. A tiny assembler program was hand-coded for a new computer (for example the IBM 650) which converted a few instructions into binary or decimal code: A1. This simple assembler program was then rewritten in its just-defined assembly language but with extensions that would enable the use of some additional mnemonics for more complex operation codes. The enhanced assembler's source program was then assembled by its predecessor's executable (A1) into binary or decimal code to give A2, and the cycle repeated (now with those enhancements available), until the entire instruction set was coded, branch addresses were automatically calculated, and other conveniences (such as conditional assembly, macros, optimisations, etc.) established. This was how the early assembly program SOAP (Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program) was developed. Compilers, linkers, loaders, and utilities were then coded in assembly language, further continuing the bootstrapping process of developing complex software systems by using simpler software.\n\nThe term was also championed by Doug Engelbart to refer to his belief that organizations could better evolve by improving the process they use for improvement (thus obtaining a compounding effect over time). His SRI team that developed the NLS hypertext system applied this strategy by using the tool they had developed to improve the tool.\n\nThe development of compilers for new programming languages first developed in an existing language but then rewritten in the new language and compiled by itself, is another example of the bootstrapping notion. Using an existing language to bootstrap a new language is one way to solve the \"chicken or the egg\" causality dilemma.\n\nDuring the installation of computer programs it is sometimes necessary to update the installer or package manager itself. The common pattern for this is to use a small executable bootstrapper file (\"e.g.\" setup.exe) which updates the installer and starts the real installation after the update. Sometimes the bootstrapper also installs other prerequisites for the software during the bootstrapping process.\n\nA bootstrapping node, also known as a rendezvous host, is a node in an overlay network that provides initial configuration information to newly joining nodes so that they may successfully join the overlay network.\n\nA type of computer simulation called discrete event simulation represents the operation of a system as a chronological sequence of events. A technique called \"bootstrapping the simulation model\" is used, which bootstraps initial data points using a pseudorandom number generator to schedule an initial set of pending events, which schedule additional events, and with time, the distribution of event times approaches its steady state—the bootstrapping behavior is overwhelmed by steady-state behavior.\n\nBootstrapping is a technique used to iteratively improve a classifier's performance. Seed AI is a hypothesized type of artificial intelligence capable of recursive self-improvement. Having improved itself, it would become better at improving itself, potentially leading to an exponential increase in intelligence. No such AI is known to exist, but it remains an active field of research.\n\nSeed AI is a significant part of some theories about the technological singularity: proponents believe that the development of seed AI will rapidly yield ever-smarter intelligence (via bootstrapping) and thus a new era.\n\nBootstrapping is a resampling technique used to obtain estimates of summary statistics.\n\nBootstrapping in business means starting a business without external help or capital. Such startups fund the development of their company through internal cash flow and are cautious with their expenses. Generally at the start of a venture, a small amount of money will be set aside for the bootstrap process. Bootstrapping can also be a supplement for econometric models. Bootstrapping was also expanded upon in the book \"Bootstrap Business\" by Richard Christiansen, the Harvard Business Review article \"The Art of Bootstrapping\" and the follow-up book \"The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses\" by Amar Bhide.\n\n\nRichard Dawkins in his book \"River Out of Eden\" used the computer bootstrapping concept to explain how biological cells differentiate: \"Different cells receive different combinations of chemicals, which switch on different combinations of genes, and some genes work to switch other genes on or off. And so the bootstrapping continues, until we have the full repertoire of different kinds of cells.\"\n\nBootstrapping analysis gives a way to judge the strength of support for clades on phylogenetic trees. A number is written by a node, which reflects the percentage of bootstrap trees which also resolve the clade at the endpoints of that branch.\n\nBootstrapping is a rule preventing the admission of hearsay evidence in conspiracy cases.\n\nBootstrapping is a theory of language acquisition.\n\nBootstrapping is using very general consistency criteria to determine the form of a quantum theory from some assumptions on the spectrum of particles or operators.\n\nIn tokamak fusion devices, bootstrapping refers to the process in which a bootstrap current is self-generated by the plasma, which reduces or eliminates the need for an external current driver. Maximising the bootstrap current is a major goal of advanced tokamak designs.\n\nBootstrapping in inertial confinement fusion refers to the alpha particles produced in the fusion reaction providing further heating to the plasma. This heating leads to ignition and an overall energy gain.\n\nBootstrapping is a form of positive feedback in analog circuit design.\n\nAn electric power grid is almost never brought down intentionally. Generators and power stations are started and shut down as necessary. A typical power station requires power for start up prior to being able to generate power. This power is obtained from the grid, so if the entire grid is down these stations cannot be started.\n\nTherefore, to get a grid started, there must be at least a small number of power stations that can start entirely on their own. A black start is the process of restoring a power station to operation without relying on external power. In the absence of grid power, one or more black starts are used to bootstrap the grid.\n\nA Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) is an intermediary element in cellular networks which provides application independent functions for mutual authentication of user equipment and servers unknown to each other and for 'bootstrapping' the exchange of secret session keys afterwards. The term 'bootstrapping' is related to building a security relation with a previously unknown device first and to allow installing security elements (keys) in the device and the BSF afterwards.\n\nA media bootstrap is the process whereby a story or meme is deliberately (but artificially) produced by self and peer-referential journalism, originally within a tight circle of media content originators, often commencing with stories written within the same media organization. This story is then expanded into a general media \"accepted wisdom\" with the aim of having it accepted as self-evident \"common knowledge\" by the reading, listening and viewing publics. The key feature of a media bootstrap is that as little hard, verifiable, external evidence as possible is used to support the story, preference being given to the citation (often unattributed) of other media stories, \"i.e.\" \"journalists interviewing journalists\".\n\nBecause the campaign is usually originated and at least initially concocted internally by a media organization with a particular agenda in mind, within a closed loop of reportage and opinionation, the campaign is said to have \"pulled itself up by its own bootstraps\".\n\nA bootstrap campaign should be distinguished from a genuine news story of genuine interest, such as a natural disaster that kills thousands, or the death of a respected public figure. It is legitimate for these stories to be given coverage across all media platforms. What distinguishes a bootstrap from a real story is the contrived and organized manner in which the bootstrap appears to come out of nowhere. A bootstrap commonly claims to be tapping a hitherto unrecognized phenomenon within society.\n\nAs self-levitating by pulling on one's bootstraps is physically impossible, this is often used by the bootstrappers themselves to deny the possibility that the bootstrap campaign is indeed concocted and artificial. They assert that it has arisen via a groundswell of public opinion. Media campaigns that are openly admitted as concocted (\"e.g.\" a public service campaign titled \"Let's Clean Up Our City\") are usually ignored by other media organizations for reasons related to competition. On the other hand, the true bootstrap welcomes the participation of other media organizations, indeed encourages it, as this participation gains the bootstrap notoriety and, most importantly, legitimacy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21707946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21707946", "title": "Bubble chart", "text": "Bubble chart\n\nA bubble chart is a type of chart that displays three dimensions of data. Each entity with its triplet (\"v\", \"v\", \"v\") of associated data is plotted as a disk that expresses two of the \"v\" values through the disk's \"xy\" location and the third through its size. Bubble charts can facilitate the understanding of social, economical, medical, and other scientific relationships.\n\nBubble charts can be considered a variation of the scatter plot, in which the data points are replaced with bubbles. As the documentation for Microsoft Office explains, \"You can use a bubble chart instead of a scatter chart if your data has three data series that each contain a set of values. The sizes of the bubbles are determined by the values in the third data series.\".\n\nThe human visual system naturally experiences a disk's size in terms of its area. And the area of a disk—unlike its diameter or circumference—is not proportional to its radius, but to the square of the radius. So if one chooses to scale the disks' radii to the third data values directly, then the apparent size differences among the disks will be non-linear (quadratic) and misleading. To get a properly weighted scale, one must scale each disk's radius to the square root of the corresponding data value \"v\".\nThis scaling issue can lead to extreme misinterpretations, especially where the range of the data has a large spread. And because many people are unfamiliar with—or do not stop to consider—the issue and its impact on perception, those who are aware of it often have to hesitate in interpreting a bubble chart because they cannot assume that the scaling correction was indeed made. So it is important that bubble charts not only be scaled in this way, but also be clearly labeled to document that it is area, rather than radius or diameter, that conveys the data.\n\nThe metaphoric representation of data values as disk areas cannot be extended for displaying values that are negative or zero.\nAs a fallback, some users of bubble charts resort to graphic symbology to express nonpositive data values. As an example, a negative value formula_1 can be represented by a disk of area formula_2 in which is centered some chosen symbol like \"×\" to indicate that the size of the bubble represents the absolute value of a negative data value. And this approach can be reasonably effective in situations where data values' magnitudes (absolute values) are themselves somewhat important—in other words, where values of formula_2 and formula_4 are similar in some context-specific way—so that their being represented by congruent disks makes sense.\n\nTo represent zero-valued data, some users dispense with disks altogether, using, say, a square centered at the appropriate location. Others use full circles for positive, and empty circles for negative values.\n\nAdditional information about the entities beyond their three primary values can often be incorporated by rendering their disks in colors and patterns that are chosen in a systematic way. And, of course, supplemental information can be added by annotating disks with textual information, sometimes as simple as unique identifying labels for cross-referencing to explanatory keys and the like.\n\n"}

It consists of two microscopes connected by an optical bridge, which results in a split view window enabling two separate objects to be viewed simultaneously. This avoids the observer having to rely on memory when comparing two objects under a conventional microscope.\n\nIn the 1920s forensic ballistics was waiting at its inception. In 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the purpose by Calvin Goddard and his partner Phillip Gravelle used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.\n\n Philip O. Gravelle, a chemist, developed a comparison microscope for use in the identification of fired bullets and cartridge cases with the support and guidance of forensic ballistics pioneer Calvin Goddard. It was a significant advance in the science of firearms identification in forensic science. The firearm from which a bullet or cartridge case has been fired is identified by the comparison of the unique striae left on the bullet or cartridge case from the worn, machined metal of the barrel, breach block, extractor, or firing pin in the gun. It was Gravelle who mistrusted his memory. \"As long as he could inspect only one bullet at a time with his microscope, and had to keep the picture of it in his memory until he placed the comparison bullet under the microscope, scientific precision could not be attained. He therefore developed the comparison microscope and Goddard made it work.\" Calvin Goddard perfected the comparison microscope and subsequently popularized its use.Sir Sydney Smith also appreciated the idea, emphasizing its importance in forensic science and firearms identification. He took the comparison microscope to Scotland and introduced it to the European scientists for firearms identification and other forensic science needs.\n\nThe modern instrument has many optical, mechanical and electronic refinements, including fiber optic illumination, video capabilities, digital imaging, automatic exposure for conventional photography, etc. Despite this evolution, however, the basic tools and techniques have remained unchanged which are to determine whether or not ammunition components were fired by a single firearm based on unique and reproducible microscopic and class characteristics, or to reach a \"no conclusion\" result if insufficient marks are present.\n\nSince, ballistic identification has benefited from a long series of structural, scientific and technological advances, law enforcement agencies have established forensic laboratories and researchers have learned much more about how to match bullets and cartridge cases to the guns used to fire them, and comparison microscopes have become more sophisticated. By the end of the 1980s, ballistic identification was an established sub-specialty of forensic science.\n\nVisualization tools have also been developed to allows the firearms examiner to verify the degree of similarity between any two tool-marks in question. These are designed to simulate the operation of the comparison microscope but is capable of rendering a 2D view of the 3D surfaces in a manner similar to that of the conventional comparison microscope.\n\nThe prevalence of hand-gun related crime in the United States compared to most other developed countries provided the impetus for the development of the comparison microscope. As with most firearms, the fired ammunition components may acquire sufficient unique and reproducible microscopic marks to be identifiable as having been fired by a single firearm. Making these comparisons is correctly referred to as firearms identification, or sometimes called as \"ballistics\".\n\nHistorically, and currently, this forensic discipline ultimately requires a microscopic side-by-side comparison of fired bullets or cartridge cases, one pair at a time, by a forensic examiner to confirm or eliminate the two items as having been fired by a single firearm. For this purpose, the traditional tool of the firearms examiner has been what is often called the ballistics comparison microscope.\n\nThe interior of a gun's barrel is machined to have grooves (called rifling) that force the bullet to rotate as it travels along it. These grooves and their counterpart, called \"lands\" imprint groove and land impressions on the surface of the bullet. Together with these land and groove impressions, imperfections on the barrel surface are incidentally transferred to the bullet's surface. Because these imperfections are randomly generated, during manufacture or due to use, they are unique to each barrel. These patterns or imperfections, therefore, amount to a \"signature\" that each barrel imprints on each of the bullets fired through it. It is this \"signature\" on the bullets imparted due to the unique imperfections on the barrel that enable the validation and identification of bullets as having originated from a particular gun. Comparison microscope is used to analyze the matching of the microscopic impressions found on the surface of bullets and casings.\n\nWhen a firearm or a bullet or cartridge case are recovered from a crime scene, forensic examiners compare the ballistic fingerprint of the recovered bullet or cartridge case with the ballistic fingerprint of a second bullet or cartridge case test-fired from the recovered firearm. If the ballistic fingerprint on the test-fired bullet or cartridge case matches the ballistic fingerprint on the recovered bullet or cartridge case, investigators know that the recovered bullet or cartridge case was also fired from the recovered gun. A confirmed link between a specific firearm and a bullet or cartridge case recovered from a crime scene constitutes a valuable lead, because investigators may be able to connect the firearm to a person, who may then become either a suspect or a source of information helpful to the investigation.\n\nForensic innovator Calvin Goddard offered ballistic identification evidence in 1921 to help secure convictions of accused murderers and anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. On April 8, 1927, Sacco and Vanzetti were finally sentenced to death in the electric chair. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the executions and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that a semi-automatic pistol could be traced by several different methods if both bullet and casing were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by firing pin indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and extractor marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of Calvin Goddard in 1927.\nGoddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted magnifier probe used to inspect gun barrels, to make an examination of Sacco's .32 Colt, the bullet that killed Berardelli, and the spent casings recovered from the scene of the crime. In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired a bullet from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and then put the ejected casing on the comparison microscope next to casings found at the scene. Then he looked at them carefully. The first two casings from the robbery did not match Sacco's gun, but the third one did. Even the defense expert agreed that the two cartridges had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions.\nIn October 1961, ballistics tests were run with improved technology using Sacco's Colt automatic. The results confirmed that the bullet that killed the victim, Berardelli in 1920 came from the same .32 Colt Auto taken from the pistol in Sacco's possession. Subsequent investigations in 1983 also supported Goddard's findings.\n\nColonel Goddard was the key forensic expert in solving the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre in which seven gangsters were killed by rival Al Capone mobsters dressed as Chicago police officers. It also led to the establishment of the United States' first independent criminological laboratory, which was located at Northwestern University and headed by Goddard. At this new lab, ballistics, fingerprinting, blood analysis and trace evidence were all brought under one roof.\nIn 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the ballistics comparison by his partner, Phillip Gravelle, Goddard used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. The case of Sacco and Vanzetti, which took place in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, is responsible for popularizing the use of the comparison microscope for bullet comparison. Forensic expert Calvin Goddard's conclusions were upheld when the evidence was re-examined in 1961.\n\n\n"}

In MMA fights are competed over, in contrast to professional wrestling where the outcomes and moves performed are often scripted or predetermined. Despite the differences in competition, there have been people that have competed in both professional wrestling and MMA. \nProfessional wrestling could be considered a performance art which combines athletics with theatrical performance. Matches are contested on a pre-determined basis, where the fight on display is merely for entertainment purposes. Viewers are integral to a professional wrestling match, as the audience is who the action is for. Professional wrestling mixes many styles of amateur wrestling, striking and showmanship to display a fight, whilst the two performers work together to achieve a \"worked\" fight. Professional wrestling was first popularized in the 19th century Europe as a carnival attraction.\n\nMixed Martial Arts, is a hybrid of many types of physical full-contact sports; including wrestling, boxing and Martial Arts, such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The early 1990s saw the Ultimate Fighting Championship popularize the term \"Mixed Martial Arts\", for such a bout. Competitors in MMA are generally skilled in many different styles, however, it is possible to be only proficient in one type of combat. As some professional wrestling moves are simply worked versions of legitimate holds, there can be a crossover between the two.\n\nPossibly the most successful pro wrestler and MMA star is Brock Lesnar, who has won the world championships in both the WWE and UFC. Other wrestlers to have won a championship in both MMA and Pro Wrestling include Bobby Lashley (Shark Fights Heavyweight Championship as well as the Impact Global Championship), and Dan Severn who won the UFC Superfight Championship, and the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nSince MMA's rise to prominence in the 1990s, some pro wrestlers or MMA fighters have been cynical against the other's profession.

A \"cue\" in perception is a that can be measured by an observer's perceptual system, that is informative about the state of some property of the world. A \"trusted cue\" is one that the system utilizes to construct appearance, i.e. to build a percept (what one \"sees\") that depends on the world state. In a \"cue recruitment experiment\", an arbitrarily chosen signal is put into correlation with trusted cues, which makes the signal into an artificial cue. If the artificial cue acquires the ability to affect appearance in a manner similar to the trusted cues, it is said to have been \"recruited\".\n\nThe cue recruitment experiment is a form of classical conditioning experiment, the simplest test for associative learning in which one (or at most a few) new signal(s) are put into correlation with one or a few trusted cues. Cue recruitment (a change in perceptual appearance) does not always occur during a cue recruitment experiment.\n\nPerceptually bistable stimuli are often used to test for cue recruitment because they allow the experimenter to measure very small cue-contingent biases in appearance. Bistable stimuli are useful for a second reason as well: trainees can easily report appearance for these stimuli. As a result, if learning occurs during the experiment, the experimenter can be sure that the learning caused a change in how the stimulus looked, rather than a change in the explicit strategy used by the trainee during responding.\n\nCue recruitment is one of many types of \"cue learning\", a more general framework due to Egon Brunswik that also encompasses other adaptive changes in the system's use of cues. Examples of cue learning that are not cue recruitment include:\n\nCue recruitment was demonstrated by Haijiang et al. (2006) using a computer-generated rotating Necker cube stimulus. This stimulus is perceptually bistable and may appear to rotate either left or right. To test for cue recruitment, binocular disparity cues (3D cues) were added to the Necker cube, to specify which part of the cube was in front and which was in back. The apparent direction of rotation was thereby brought under experimenter control. The new cue was that the cube moved upward or downward on every trial (contingent on its direction of rotation). Test trials contained the new cue but not the trusted cue. On these trials, trainees tended to see the cube rotating in the same direction it had during training (depending on whether its motion was upward or downward).\n\n"}

The \"dharmakāya\" constitutes the unmanifested, \"inconceivable\" (\"acintya\") aspect of a buddha out of which buddhas arise and to which they return after their dissolution. Buddhas are manifestations of the \"dharmakāya\" called the \"nirmāṇakāya\", \"transformation body\". Reginald Ray writes of it as \"the body of reality itself, without specific, delimited form, wherein the Buddha is identified with the spiritually charged nature of everything that is.\"\n\nThe Dhammakaya tradition of Thailand and the \"Tathāgatagarbha sūtras\" of the ancient Indian tradition view the \"dharmakāya\" as the \"ātman\" (true self) of the Buddha present within all beings.\n\nIn Tibetan, the term \"chos sku\" glosses \"dharmakāya\"; it is composed of \"chos\" \"religion, dharma\" and \"sku\" \"body, form, image, bodily form, figure\". Thondup & Talbott render it as the \"ultimate body\". In a key scholarly collaborative, Nyingma translation work published in 2005, furthermore notable as the first complete rendering of the \"Bardo Thodol\" into the English language from the Tibetan, this technical term was configured into English as \"Buddha-body of Reality\".\n\nThe Yungdrung Bon term for \"dharmakāya\" is \"rdzogs sku\", where \"rdzogs\" means \"perfection\".\n\nIn the Pāli Canon, Gautama Buddha tells Vasettha that the Tathāgata (the Buddha) is \"Dhammakaya\", the \"Truth-body\" or the \"Embodiment of Truth\", as well as \"Dharmabhuta\", \"Truth-become\", that is, \"One who has become Truth.\"\nDuring the Buddha's life great veneration was shown to him. A mythology developed concerning the physical characteristics of Universal Buddhas.\n\nAfter the Buddha's \"Parinirvana\" a distinction was made between the Buddha’s physical body or \"rūpakaya\" and his \"dharmakaya\" aspect. As the Buddha told Vakkali, he was a living example of the \"Truth\" of the \"Dharma\". Without that form to relate to, the Buddha's followers could only relate to the \"dharmakaya\" aspect of him.\n\nIn SN 6.2 – Garava sutta. Buddha paid homage to the \"Dhamma\" and tell, that he will respect it.\n\nThe \"Trikaya doctrine\" (Sanskrit, literally \"three bodies\" or \"three personalities\") is a Buddhist teaching both on the nature of reality, and the appearances of a Buddha.\n\nThe \"dharmakaya\"-doctrine was possibly first expounded in the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā\", composed in the 1st century BCE.\n\nAround 300 CE, the Yogacara school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the \"Trikaya\" \"three-body\" doctrine. According to this doctrine, Buddhahood has three aspects:\n\nTulku Thondup states that \"dharmakaya\" must possess three great qualities:\n\nAccording to Guang Xing, two main aspects of the Buddha can be seen in Mahāsāṃghika teachings: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through skillful means. For the Mahāsaṃghikas, the historical Gautama Buddha was one of these transformation bodies (Skt. \"nirmāṇakāya\"), while the essential real Buddha is equated with the \"dharmakāya\".\n\nSarvāstivādins viewed the Buddha's physical body (Skt. \"rūpakāya\") as being impure and improper for taking refuge in, and they instead regarded taking refuge in the Buddha as taking refuge in the dharmakāya of the Buddha. As stated in the \"Mahāvibhāṣā\":\nIn the Pali Canon of Theravada Buddhism, the \"Dhammakāya\" (\"dharmakāya\") is explained as a figurative term, meaning the \"body\" or the sum of the Buddha's teachings. The Canon does not invest the term \"dhammakāya\" with a metaphysical or unrealistic connotation. Jantrasrisalai disagrees though, arguing that the term originally was more connected with the process of enlightenment than the way it later came to be interpreted.\n\nIn the \"atthakathā\"s (commentaries on the Buddhist texts), the interpretation of the word depends on the author. Though both Buddhaghoṣa and Dhammapāla describe \"dhammakāya\" as the nine supramundane states (\"navalokuttaradhamma\"), their interpretations differ in other aspects. Buddhaghoṣa always follows the canonical interpretation, referring to the \"teaching\" of the \"lokuttaradhamma\"s, but Dhammapāla interprets \"dhammakāya\" as the \"spiritual attainments\" of the Buddha. Dhammapāla's interpretation is still essentially Theravāda though, since the Buddha is still considered a human being, albeit an enlightened one. The Buddha's body is still subject to \"kamma\" and limited in the same way as other people's bodies are.\n\nIn a post-canonical text Sri Lankan text called Saddharmaratnākaraya, a distinction is drawn between four different \"kāya\"s: the \"rūpakāya\", \"dharmakāya\", \"nimittakāya\" and \"suñyakāya\". The \"rūpakāya\" refers to the four \"jhāna\"s here; the \"dharmakāya\" refers to the attainment of the first eight of the nine \"lokuttaradhamma\"s; the \"nimittakāya\" refers to the final \"lokuttaradhamma\": \"Nibbāna\" with a physical remainder (\"sopadisesanibbāna\"); and the \"suñyakāya\" refers to \"Nibbāna\" without physical remainder (\"anupādisesanibbāna\"). However, even this teaching of four \"kāya\"s does not really stray outside of orthodox Theravāda tradition.\n\nIn a more unorthodox approach, Maryla Falk has made the argument that in the earliest form of Buddhism, a yogic path existed which involved the acquisition of a \"manomayakāya\" or \"dhammakāya\" and an \"amatakāya\", in which the \"manomayakāya\" or \"dhammakāya\" refers to the attainment of the \"jhānas\", and the \"amatakāya\" to the attainment of insight and the culmination of the path. In this case, the \"kāyas\" refer to a general path and fruit, not only to the person of the Buddha. Although Reynolds does not express agreement with Falk's entire theory, he does consider the idea of an earlier yogic strand worthy of investigation. Furthermore, he points out that there are remarkable resemblances with interpretations that can be found in \"Yogāvacara\" texts, often called Tantric Theravada.\n\nThe usage of the word \"dhammakāya\" is common in Tantric Theravāda texts. It is also a common term in later texts concerning the consecration of Buddha images. In these later texts, which are often descriptions of \"kammaṭṭhāna\" (meditation methods), different parts of the body of the Buddha are associated with certain spiritual attainments, and the practitioner determines to pursue these attainments himself. The idea that certain characteristics or attainments of the Buddha can be pursued is usually considered a Mahāyāna idea, but unlike Mahāyāna, Yogāvacara texts do not describe the Buddha in ontological terms, and commonly use only Theravāda terminology.\n\nThe Dhammakaya Movement of Thai Theravada Buddhism has doctrinal elements which distinguish it from conventional Theravāda Buddhism. Basing itself on the Pali suttas and meditative experience, the movement teaches that the \"Dhammakaya\" is the eternal Buddha within all beings. The \"dhammakaya\" is \"Nibbāna\", and \"Nibbāna\" is equated with the true Self (as opposed to the non-self). In some respects its teachings resemble the Buddha-nature doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism. Paul Williams has commented that this view of Buddhism is similar to ideas found in the shentong teachings of the Jonang school of Tibet made famous by Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen.\n\nThe Thai meditation masters who teach of a true self of which they claim to have gained meditative experience are not rejected by Thai Buddhists in general, but tend, on the contrary, to be particularly revered and worshipped in Thailand as arahats or even \"bodhisattvas\", far more so than more orthodox Theravada monks and scholars.\n\nAccording to Paul Williams, there are three ways of seeing the concept of the \"dharmakaya\" in the \"prajnaparamita \" sutras:\nIn the tathagatagarbha sutric tradition, the \"dharmakaya\" is taught by the Buddha to constitute the transcendental, blissful, eternal, and pure Self of the Buddha. \"These terms are found in sutras such as the \"Lankavatara\", \"Gandavyuha\", \"Angulimaliya\", \"Srimala\", and the \"Mahaparinirvana\", where they are used to describe the Buddha, the Truth Body (\"dharmakaya\") and the Buddha-nature.\" They are the \"transcendent results [of spiritual attainment]\".\n\nIn the \"Lotus Sutra\" (sixth fascicle) the Buddha explains that he has always and will always exist to lead beings to their salvation.\n\nPadmasambhava, Karma Lingpa, Gyurme Dorje, Graham Coleman and Thupten Jinpa define \"Buddha-body of Reality\", which is a rendering of the Tibetan \"chos-sku\" and the Sanskrit \"dharmakāya\", as:\nReginald Ray, writing of the Vajrayana view of the \"dharmakaya\", defines it as:\nThe Dalai Lama defines the dharmakaya as \"the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras.\". However he also states that its distinct from the Hindu concept of Brahman because buddhism adheres to the doctrine of emptyness (sunyata).\n\nAccording to Jamgon Kongtrul, the founder of the Rimé movement, in his 19th century commentary to the Lojong slogan, \"To see confusion as the four kayas, the sunyata protection is unsurpassable\", when one meditates on ultimate \"bodhicitta\" and rests in a state where appearances simply appear but there is no clinging to them, the \"dharmakaya\" aspect is that all appearances are empty in nature, the \"sambhogakāya\" is that they appear with clarity, the \"nirmanakaya\" is that this emptiness and clarity occur together, and the natural \"kāya\" aspect is that these are inseparable.\n\nRecently, \"Dharmakaya\" has also become the name for an organization founded by H. E. the 4th Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche, and is affiliated with his global organization the United Trungram Buddhist Fellowship (UTBF). \n\nGyaltrul Rinpoche's Dharmakaya organization was founded for the specific purpose of bringing the teachings and meditation practices from the Trungram Tradition of the Karma Kagyu lineage to North America. \n\nIn the early traditions of Buddhism, depictions of Gautama Buddha were neither iconic nor aniconic but depictions of empty space and absence: petrosomatoglyphs (Images of a part of the body carved in rock), for example.\n\nThondup and Talbott identify dharmakaya with the naked (\"sky-clad\"; Sanskrit: \"Digāmbara\"), unornamented, sky-blue Samantabhadra:\nFremantle states:\nThe colour blue is an iconographic polysemic rendering of the \"mahābhūta\" element of the \"pure light\" of space (Sanskrit: \"ākāśa\").\n\nThe conceptually bridging and building poetic device of analogy, as an exemplar where \"dharmakaya\" is evocatively likened to sky and space, is a persistent and pervasive visual metaphor throughout the early Dzogchen and Nyingma literature and functions as a linkage and conduit between the 'conceptual' and 'conceivable' and the 'ineffable' and 'inconceivable' (Sanskrit: \"acintya\"). It is particularly referred to by the \"terma\" \"Gongpa Zangtel\" , a terma cycle revealed by Rigdzin Gödem (1337–1408) and part of the Nyingma \"Northern Treasures\" ().\n\nSawyer conveys the importance of mirror iconography to \"dharmakaya\":\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9825116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9825116", "title": "Diffraction formalism", "text": "Diffraction formalism\n\nDiffraction processes affecting waves are amenable to quantitative description and analysis. Such treatments are applied to a wave passing through one or more slits whose width is specified as a proportion of the wavelength. Numerical approximations may be used, including the Fresnel and Fraunhofer approximations.\n\nBecause diffraction is the result of addition of all waves (of given wavelength) along all unobstructed paths, the usual procedure is to consider the contribution of an infinitesimally small neighborhood around a certain path (this contribution is usually called a wavelet) and then integrate over all paths (= add all wavelets) from the source to the detector (or given point on a screen). \n\nThus in order to determine the pattern produced by diffraction, the phase and the amplitude of each of the wavelets is calculated. That is, at each point in space we must determine the distance to each of the simple sources on the incoming wavefront. If the distance to each of the simple sources differs by an integer number of wavelengths, all the wavelets will be in phase, resulting in constructive interference. If the distance to each source is an integer plus one half of a wavelength, there will be complete destructive interference. Usually, it is sufficient to determine these minima and maxima to explain the observed diffraction effects. \n\nThe simplest descriptions of diffraction are those in which the situation can be reduced to a two-dimensional problem. For water waves, this is already the case, as water waves propagate only on the surface of the water. For light, we can often neglect one dimension if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength. In the case of light shining through small circular holes we will have to take into account the full three-dimensional nature of the problem.\n\nSeveral qualitative observations can be made of diffraction in general:\n\nThe problem of calculating what a diffracted wave looks like, is the problem of determining the phase of each of the simple sources on the incoming wave front. It is mathematically easier to consider the case of far-field or Fraunhofer diffraction, where the point of observation is far from that of the diffracting obstruction, and as a result, involves less complex mathematics than the more general case of near-field or Fresnel diffraction. To make this statement more quantitative, let us consider a diffracting object at the origin that has a size formula_1. For definiteness let us say we are diffracting light and we are interested in what the intensity looks like on a screen a distance formula_2 away from the object. At some point on the screen the path length to one side of the object is given by the Pythagorean theorem\nIf we now consider the situation where formula_4, the path length becomes\nThis is the Fresnel approximation. To further simplify things: If the diffracting object is much smaller than the distance formula_2, the last term will contribute much less than a wavelength to the path length, and will then not change the phase appreciably. That is formula_7. The result is the Fraunhofer approximation, which is only valid very far away from the object \nDepending on the size of the diffraction object, the distance to the object and the wavelength of the wave, the Fresnel approximation, the Fraunhofer approximation or neither approximation may be valid. As the distance between the measured point of diffraction and the obstruction point increases, the diffraction patterns or results predicted converge towards those of Fraunhofer diffraction, which is more often observed in nature due to the extremely small wavelength of visible light.\n\nMultiple-slit arrangements can be mathematically considered as multiple simple wave sources, if the slits are narrow enough. For light, a slit is an opening that is infinitely extended in one dimension, and this has the effect of reducing a wave problem in 3D-space to a simpler problem in 2D-space. \nThe simplest case is that of two narrow slits, spaced a distance formula_1 apart. To determine the maxima and minima in the amplitude we must determine the path difference to the first slit and to the second one. In the Fraunhofer approximation, with the observer far away from the slits, the difference in path length to the two slits can be seen from the image to be\nMaxima in the intensity occur if this path length difference is an integer number of wavelengths.\n\nThe corresponding minima are at path differences of an integer number plus one half of the wavelength:\n\nFor an array of slits, positions of the minima and maxima are not changed, the \"fringes\" visible on a screen however do become sharper, as can be seen in the image. \nTo calculate this intensity pattern, one needs to introduce some more sophisticated methods. The mathematical representation of a radial wave is given by\n\nwhere formula_13, formula_14 is the wavelength, formula_15 is frequency of the wave and formula_16 is the phase of the wave at the slits at time t=0. The wave at a screen some distance away from the plane of the slits is given by the sum of the waves emanating from each of the slits. \nTo make this problem a little easier, we introduce the complex wave formula_17, the real part of which is equal to formula_18\nThe absolute value of this function gives the wave amplitude, and the complex phase of the function corresponds to the phase of the wave. formula_17 is referred to as the complex amplitude.\nWith formula_22 slits, the total wave at point formula_23 on the screen is\n\nSince we are for the moment only interested in the amplitude and relative phase, we can ignore any overall phase factors that are not dependent on formula_23 or formula_26. We approximate formula_27. In the Fraunhofer limit we can neglect terms of order :formula_28 in the exponential, and any terms involving formula_29 or formula_30 in the denominator. The sum becomes\n\nThe sum has the form of a geometric sum and can be evaluated to give\n\nThe intensity is given by the absolute value of the complex amplitude squared \n\nwhere formula_34 denotes the complex conjugate of formula_35.\n\nAs an example, an exact equation can now be derived for the intensity of the diffraction pattern as a function of angle in the case of single-slit diffraction. \n\nA mathematical representation of Huygens' principle can be used to start an equation.\n\nConsider a monochromatic complex plane wave formula_36 of wavelength λ incident on a slit of width \"a\". \n\nIf the slit lies in the x′-y′ plane, with its center at the origin, then it can be assumed that diffraction generates a complex wave ψ, traveling radially in the r direction away from the slit, and this is given by:\n\nLet (x′,y′,0) be a point inside the slit over which it is being integrated. If (x,0,z) is the location at which the intensity of the diffraction pattern is being computed, the slit extends from formula_38 to formula_39, and from formula_40 to formula_41.\n\nThe distance \"r\" from the slot is: \n\nAssuming Fraunhofer diffraction will result in the conclusion formula_44. In other words, the distance to the target is much larger than the diffraction width on the target.\nBy the binomial expansion rule, ignoring terms quadratic and higher, the quantity on the right can be estimated to be:\n\nIt can be seen that 1/\"r\" in front of the equation is non-oscillatory, i.e. its contribution to the magnitude of the intensity is small compared to our exponential factors. Therefore, we will lose little accuracy by approximating it as \"1/z\".\n\nTo make things cleaner, a placeholder 'C' is used to denote constants in the equation. It is important to keep in mind that C can contain imaginary numbers, thus the wave function will be complex. However, at the end, the ψ will be bracketed, which will eliminate any imaginary components.\n\nNow, in Fraunhofer diffraction, formula_47 is small, so formula_48 (note that formula_49 participates in this exponential and it is being integrated).\n\nIn contrast the term formula_50 can be eliminated from the equation, since when bracketed it gives 1.\n\nTaking formula_53 results in:\n\nIt can be noted through Euler's formula and its derivatives that formula_54 and formula_55. \n\nformula_56\n\nwhere the (unnormalized) sinc function is defined by formula_57.\n\nNow, substituting in formula_58, the intensity (squared amplitude) formula_59 of the diffracted waves at an angle θ is given by:\n\nLet us again start with the mathematical representation of Huygens' principle.\n\nConsider formula_61 slits in the prime plane of equal size formula_62 and spacing formula_63 spread along the formula_49 axis. As above, the distance formula_65 from slit 1 is:\n\nTo generalize this to formula_61 slits, we make the observation that while formula_68 and formula_69 remain constant, formula_49 shifts by \n\nThus \n\nand the sum of all formula_61 contributions to the wave function is:\n\nAgain noting that formula_75 is small, so formula_76, we have:\n\nNow, we can use the following identity\n\nformula_77\n\nSubstituting into our equation, we find:\n\nWe now make our formula_78 substitution as before and represent all non-oscillating constants by the formula_79 variable as in the 1-slit diffraction and bracket the result. Remember that \n\nThis allows us to discard the tailing exponent and we have our answer:\n\nIn the far field, where r is essentially constant, then the equation:\n\nis equivalent to doing a fourier transform on the gaps in the barrier.\n\n"}
{"id": "20550772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20550772", "title": "Evidence", "text": "Evidence\n\nEvidence, broadly construed, is anything presented in support of an assertion. This support may be strong or weak. The strongest type of evidence is that which provides direct proof of the truth of an assertion. At the other extreme is evidence that is merely consistent with an assertion but does not rule out other, contradictory assertions, as in circumstantial evidence.\n\nIn law, rules of evidence govern the types of evidence that are admissible in a legal proceeding. Types of legal evidence include testimony, documentary evidence, and physical evidence. The parts of a legal case which are not in controversy are known, in general, as the \"facts of the case.\" Beyond any facts that are undisputed, a judge or jury is usually tasked with being a trier of fact for the other issues of a case. Evidence and rules are used to decide questions of fact that are disputed, some of which may be determined by the legal burden of proof relevant to the case. Evidence in certain cases (e.g. capital crimes) must be more compelling than in other situations (e.g. minor civil disputes), which drastically affects the quality and quantity of evidence necessary to decide a case.\n\nScientific evidence consists of observations and experimental results that serve to support, refute, or modify a scientific hypothesis or theory, when collected and interpreted in accordance with the scientific method.\n\nIn philosophy, the study of evidence is closely tied to epistemology, which considers the nature of knowledge and how it can be acquired.\n\nThe \"burden of proof\" is the obligation of a party in an argument or dispute to provide sufficient evidence to shift the other party's or a third party's belief from their initial position. The burden of proof must be fulfilled by both establishing confirming evidence and negating oppositional evidence. Conclusions drawn from evidence may be subject to criticism based on a perceived failure to fulfill the burden of proof.\n\nTwo principal considerations are:\nThe latter question depends on the nature of the point under contention and determines the quantity and quality of evidence required to meet the burden of proof.\n\nIn a criminal trial in the United States, for example, the prosecution carries the burden of proof since the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Similarly, in most civil procedures, the plaintiff carries the burden of proof and must convince a judge or jury that the preponderance of the evidence is on their side. Other legal standards of proof include \"reasonable suspicion\", \"probable cause\" (as for arrest), \"\"prima facie\" evidence\", \"credible evidence\", \"substantial evidence\", and \"clear and convincing evidence\".\n\nIn a philosophical debate, there is an implicit burden of proof on the party asserting a claim, since the default position is generally one of neutrality or unbelief. Each party in a debate will therefore carry the burden of proof for any assertion they make in the argument, although some assertions may be granted by the other party without further evidence. If the debate is set up as a resolution to be supported by one side and refuted by another, the overall burden of proof is on the side supporting the resolution.\n\nIn scientific research evidence is accumulated through observations of phenomena that occur in the natural world, or which are created as experiments in a laboratory or other controlled conditions. Scientific evidence usually goes towards supporting or rejecting a hypothesis.\n\nThe burden of proof is on the person making a contentious claim. Within science, this translates to the burden resting on presenters of a paper, in which the presenters argue for their specific findings. This paper is placed before a panel of judges where the presenter must defend the thesis against all challenges.\n\nWhen evidence is contradictory to predicted expectations, the evidence and the ways of making it are often closely scrutinized (see experimenter's regress) and only at the end of this process is the hypothesis rejected: this can be referred to as 'refutation of the hypothesis'. The rules for evidence used by science are collected systematically in an attempt to avoid the bias inherent to anecdotal evidence.\n\nEvidence forms the very foundation of a legal system, without which law would be subject to the whims of those with power.\n\nIn law, the production and presentation of evidence depends first on establishing on whom the burden of proof lies. Admissible evidence is that which a court receives and considers for the purposes of deciding a particular case. Two primary burden-of-proof considerations exist in law. The first is on whom the burden rests. In many, especially Western, courts, the burden of proof is placed on the prosecution in criminal cases and the plaintiff in civil cases. The second consideration is the degree of certitude proof must reach, depending on both the quantity and quality of evidence. These degrees are different for criminal and civil cases, the former requiring evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, the latter considering only which side has the preponderance of evidence, or whether the proposition is more likely true or false. The decision maker, often a jury, but sometimes a judge, decides whether the burden of proof has been fulfilled.\n\nAfter deciding who will carry the burden of proof, evidence is first gathered and then presented before the court:\n\nIn criminal investigation, rather than attempting to prove an abstract or hypothetical point, the evidence gatherers attempt to determine who is responsible for a criminal act. The focus of criminal evidence is to connect physical evidence and reports of witnesses to a specific person.\n\nThe path that physical evidence takes from the scene of a crime or the arrest of a suspect to the courtroom is called the chain of custody. In a criminal case, this path must be clearly documented or attested to by those who handled the evidence. If the chain of evidence is broken, a defendant may be able to persuade the judge to declare the evidence inadmissible.\n\nPresenting evidence before the court differs from the gathering of evidence in important ways. Gathering evidence may take many forms; presenting evidence that tend to prove or disprove the point at issue is strictly governed by rules. Failure to follow these rules leads to any number of consequences. In law, certain policies allow (or require) evidence to be excluded from consideration based either on indicia relating to reliability, or broader social concerns. Testimony (which tells) and exhibits (which show) are the two main categories of evidence presented at a trial or hearing. In the United States, evidence in federal court is admitted or excluded under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n\n\n"}

Though it draws heavily from feminist legal theory, feminist interventions in the philosophy of law differs from the more common feminist jurisprudence as it also seeks to explain the justification that a government has in interfering with the lives of its citizenry. Accordingly, then, feminist interventions in legal philosophy specifically addresses the relationship and rationale between a judicial system’s exercise of power and its effects on female citizens. While particular views vary greatly, most feminist interventions in the philosophy of law operate under a belief that many contemporary legal systems are predicated on patriarchal notions of masculinity that result in a system of deeply-rooted bias and inequality.\n\nThe rule of law is generally defined as the fundamental principle that both government and its citizens all operate under a system of general and fair rules that are publicly disclosed. In relation to feminism, feminist philosophers of law typically perceive the current iteration of the rule of law as an institution that perpetuates primarily patriarchal norms, or in terms of power relationships that have been primarily been dominated by males. As such, they perceive the current normativity of law as perpetuating male values as the status quo. Though feminists maintain several different positions in terms of how to address these issues, it is almost universally agreed that these patriarchal structures cannot be properly challenged until their underlying biases are fully exposed.\n\nAs in traditional feminist jurisprudence, feminists hold several competing philosophical positions in regards to ways the law should work to better accommodate women.\n\nCultural feminists contend that the solution to attaining legal equality must come from procedural reform that embraces the differences between men and women. The challenge here derives from acknowledging various differences between men and women without further reinforcing gender stereotypes or promoting sexist practices. As such, the government must intervene insofar as it promotes laws that embrace only the immutable differences between the sexes—such as pregnancy—with the ultimate goal being equal recognition to women's moral voice of caring and communal values. Specifically, whereas women emphasize the importance of relationships and reconciliation of conflicting positions, men emphasize more abstract principles such as rights and logic. Thus, cultural feminists see their intervention into law as a means to achieve balance and reconciliation between the two.\n\nLiberal feminists believe women and men possess the same rational capabilities and have no fundamental differences in capability; therefore, they assert that women should have equal opportunity as men to the extent that some liberal feminists believe there should be no legal distinctions between men or women. Accordingly, the law’s role, according to the liberal feminist, should strive for the utmost equality between men and women. This is because liberal feminists believe that women have long been denied the same bodily autonomy that has been enjoyed by their male counterparts. Such issues manifest themselves in the form of the debate on whether or not the law ought to legally recognize industries like prostitution as a legitimate entity.\n\nAnother noteworthy area in law where parity is specifically desired is in the “standards of reasonableness” that are used in criminal, contract, and tort law, which liberal feminists argue are predicated on masculine assumptions of what is “reasonable.” Thus, liberal feminists seek to articulate how this masculine norm accordingly affects those aspects of law in regards to judging women or other feminine groups as “reasonable” in trial.\n\nFurthermore, liberal feminists also place a particular value on intersectionality theories. The primary reason for this growing movement is that keeping categories such as race and sex separate often made such persons \"invisible\" by making it more difficult to exact equality for persons who were oppressed for their gender, race, or class.\n\nDominant, or \"radical\", feminists maintain that there are differences between men and women, but these differences do not derive from innate differences between men and women; rather, such differences come as a result of women being subjugated by men in larger society. As such, it is not merely enough to embrace the differences between men and women: sexual equality under the rule of law must be established upon a female paradigm that cannot simply be an addition to the current paradigm of masculinity. In terms of philosophical interventions, dominant feminists contend that a systemic reevaluation must take place within any legal system that operates to subjugate women. Moreover, the law must be constructed in such a way that it does not work to a disparate effect of either sex.\n\nYet, some radical feminists even contend that it is fundamentally flawed to have a paradigm based upon only women, because this mistakenly implies women as all having the same interests, identities, needs, and values. Such paradigms are said to be flawed because they privilege the preferences and viewpoints of more privileged white women. Instead, feminist analysis should focus on the intersections of gender, race, class, and sexual orientation and their treatment by law. Still others seek policies or modes of analysis that use both men and women, of all kinds of background, as the starting point of analysis, and design rules for workplaces, families, politics, and society that are fully inclusive of these backgrounds.\n\nFeminist interventions concerning women's issues of bodily autonomy cover a wide range of legal topics, such as abortion, prostitution, and rape.\n\nSeveral American legal feminists have expressed approval of the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in \"Roe v. Wade\", which guaranteed the right to have an abortion in the United States. Lucinda Peach, for example, argued in her 2002 essay that controlling one’s own body was a necessary condition for any other freedom. Other scholars, though generally accepting of the Court's decision, have nevertheless argued that the Court's opinion was based upon \"paternalistic attitudes\" regarding women.\n\nYet, other feminist legal commentators have acknowledged the difficulties associated with the legalization of abortion in the United States. For example, certain feminists concerned with the rights of the disabled argue that abortion decisions that are based on inadequate or biased information about disabilities are inherently problematic. Likewise, certain feminists of color are more concerned with whether some abortion policies themselves are racially biased, implicitly or even explicitly. Some scholars have even gone as far as to suggest that \"Roe v. Wade\" \"was not a victory for women but a victory for the medical profession; it gave physicians, not women, the right to make abortion decisions.\"\n\nSome legal feminists have argued that markets which cater specifically to sexual services should be banned by the state. This is because such markets are viewed as exploitative of marginalized classes of people and pose numerous risks to its workers. In her essay published in 2010, Debrah Satz argued that feminist interventions in the law should be opposed to the legalization of prostitution, as prostitution often employs people from stigmatized or disempowered social classes, fails to create conditions for informed consent, endangers the health of its participants, and reinforces invidious stereotypes about women or other groups. Similarly, Carole Pateman has argued that, because people’s bodies and sexual capacities are an integral part of their identity, the woman who works as a prostitute sells her womanhood and, consequently, her very self.\n\nMartha Nussbaum—who is a Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago—has devoted several of her publications to explaining why the social stigma associated with sex work is irrational. As she believes it, feminists should oppose the stigmatization of sex work, rather than oppose sex work for its contribution to the stigmatization of women. Furthermore, Nussbaum speculated that the problems associated with prostitution are reflective of many other social practices, and that these social practices are not inherent to prostitution but are often a function of the prostitute’s working conditions and treatment by others.\n\nFeminist legal scholars have also attempted to address the many ways in which law fails to protect women and girls against forms of violence such as rape, domestic abuse, sexual harassment, and other forms of sexual abuse. Traditionally, legal scholars acknowledge that a central purpose of civil law has been to keep men from violating one another; however, violation of women by men had historically been largely considered a private matter beyond the purview of law. Domestic chastisement was once considered legitimate discipline of one’s wife and marital rape was excluded from the definition of rape in many criminal law statutes.\n\nWithin the past few decades, however, Feminists have noted that multiple nations have made advances to their legal protections regarding sexual assault. For instance, many western nations no longer require the corroboration of rape by witnesses; additionally, other jurisdictions hold that consent is no longer presumed from the absence of resistance; and most western nations now require far stricter requirements for the relevance of evidence presented in rape trials.\n\n"}

Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) introduced the puzzle at the beginning of his article \"Über Sinn und Bedeutung\" (\"On Sense and Reference\") in 1892 in one of the most influential articles in analytic philosophy and philosophy of language.\n\nThe term \"Frege's puzzle\" is commonly applied to two related problems. One is a problem about identity statements that Frege raised at the beginning of \"On Sense and Reference\", and another concerns propositional attitude reports. For the first problem, consider the following two sentences:\n\n(1) Hesperus is Hesperus.\n\n(2) Hesperus is Phosphorus.\n\nEach of these sentences is true, since 'Hesperus' refers to the same object as 'Phosphorus' (the planet Venus). Nonetheless, (1) and (2) seem to differ in their meaning or what Frege called \"cognitive value\". (1) is just a truth of logic that can be known a priori, whereas (2) records an empirical truth that was discovered by astronomers. The problem, however, is that proper names are often taken to have no meaning beyond their reference (a view often associated with John Stuart Mill). But this seems to imply that the two statements mean the same thing, or have the same cognitive value.\n\nFrege proposed to resolve this puzzle by postulating a second level of meaning besides reference in the form of what he called sense: a difference in the mode of presentation or the way an object can be \"given\" to us. Thus 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' have the same reference, but differ in sense because they present Venus in different ways.\n\nThe second puzzle concerns propositional attitude reports, such as belief reports. Ordinarily, coreferring names are substitutable salva veritate, that is, without change in truth value. For example, if 'Hesperus is bright' is true then 'Phosphorus is bright' is also true given that 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' refer to the same planet. But now consider the following argument:\n\n(3) Alex believes Hesperus is visible in the evening.\n\n(4) Hesperus = Phosphorus.\n\n(5) Alex believes Phosphorus is visible in the evening.\n\nThis argument appears to be invalid: even if (3) and (4) are true, (5) could be false. If Alex is not aware that Hesperus and Phosphorus are the same planet, then it seems that he could believe that Hesperus is visible in the evening while rejecting the claim that Phosphorus is visible in the evening (perhaps he thinks Phosphorus, the morning star, is only visible in the morning). The principle that coreferring names are substitutable \"salva veritate\" thus appears to fail in the context of belief reports (and similarly for other propositional attitude reports).\n\nFrege again proposed to solve this problem by appeal to his distinction between sense and reference. In particular, he held that when a proper name occurs in the context of an attitude report, its reference shifts to its ordinary sense: thus 'Phosphorus', for example, denotes the planet Venus when it occurs in the sentence 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' or in an identity sentence like (4), but when it occurs embedded in an attitude report like (5) it denotes its ordinary \"sense.\"\n\nFrege's puzzle has received a great deal of attention since the attacks on the descriptivist theory of names mounted in the 1970s and 1980s by philosophers such as Keith Donnellan, Saul Kripke, Ruth Barcan Marcus, Hilary Putnam, and David Kaplan. In the wake of these attacks on descriptivism, many philosophers embraced the Millian or direct-reference view of proper names, according to which the meaning of a name is simply its referent. As noted above, this Millian view has the result that (1) and (2) express the same proposition. Similarly, the embedded sentences 'Hesperus is visible in the evening' and 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' from (3) and (5) express the same proposition. It therefore looks like (3) and (5) cannot differ in truth value since they attribute belief in one and the same proposition.\n\nIn view of this problem, many philosophers of language have attempted to work out a solution to the puzzle within the confines of direct-reference theories of proper names. Some of these philosophers include Nathan Salmon (e.g. in \"Frege's puzzle\" and \"Content, Cognition, and Communication\"), Howard Wettstein (e.g. in \"Has Semantics Rested on a Mistake?\"), Scott Soames, David Kaplan, John Perry (e.g. in \"Reference and Reflexivity\"), and Joseph Almog.\n\n"}

During the 1980s, Aoki was part of the production staff for the \"American Top 40\" radio program.\n\nIn July 2001, Aoki became embroiled in a public controversy stemming from his objection to a joke told by comedian Sarah Silverman, which involved her use of the ethnic slur \"chink\", in an interview on the July 11, 2001 episode of \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\".\n\nIn the interview, Silverman explained that a friend had advised her on how to avoid jury duty by writing a racial slur on the selection form, \"something really inappropriate, like, 'I hate chinks'.\" However, Silverman said that she ultimately decided that she did not want to be thought of as a racist and instead wrote, \"I \"love\" chinks.\" The Associated Press quoted Aoki: \"There is no excuse for something like this to have made the air. The term is the most offensive possible reference to a person of Chinese descent.\" NBC and Conan O'Brien issued an apology, but Silverman did not, insisting later on the July 26, 2001 episode of \"Politically Incorrect\" that she did not believe that Aoki was genuinely offended, but exploiting the opportunity for publicity.\n\nSilverman and Aoki later appeared together on the August 22, 2001 episode of \"Politically Incorrect,\" along with host Bill Maher and panelists David Spade and Anne-Marie Johnson, the latter of whom was chair of the Screen Actors Guild Ethnic Employment Opportunity Committee.

Johnson, however, questioned the humor in the joke, and Aoki opined that such slurs should not be used in an off-the-cuff manner because it legitimized their use, and that use of the word \"chink\" was no better than the use of the word \"nigger\". Aoki, while acknowledging that satire was a legitimate practice, asserted that Silverman's execution of it was not successful because it ran the risk that people would assume she actually subscribed to the racist viewpoint of her character.\n\nIn July 2003 Media Action Network protested the British program \"Banzai\", which is produced by Channel 4. Following the first U.S. broadcast of the series on the Fox Network on July 13, 2003, the Media Action Network accused the program, a spoof betting show that parodies Japanese game shows, of employing demeaning stereotypes of Asians. About 20 members of the group carried signs and shouted slogans outside a presentation by the Fox network to TV critics in Hollywood. Aoki commented, \"This is like an Asian minstrel show. Can you imagine the black version of Banzai?\" Fox spokesman Scott Grogin responded by saying, \"We've received an entire range of comments on the show, both pro and con\", and that as a satire, the show should be viewed as \"tongue-in-cheek\". According to Aoki, in discussions with the MANAA, Fox offered to include a disclaimer at the beginning of the show, but Aoki indicated that this would not assuage the MANAA, who wished the program not be broadcast at all.\n\n"}

According to it, scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a hypothesis in a form that can be falsifiable, using a test on observable data where the outcome is not yet known. A test outcome that could have and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis. A test outcome that could have, but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory. It is then proposed to compare the explanatory value of competing hypotheses by testing how stringently they are corroborated by their predictions.\n\nOne example of an algorithmic statement of the hypothetico-deductive method is as follows:\n\nOne possible sequence in this model would be 1, 2, 3, 4. If the outcome of 4 holds, and 3 is not yet disproven, you may continue with 3, 4, 1, and so forth; but if the outcome of 4 shows 3 to be false, you will have to go back to 2 and try to invent a new 2, deduce a new 3, look for 4, and so forth.\n\nNote that this method can never absolutely verify (prove the truth of) 2. It can only falsify 2. (This is what Einstein meant when he said, \"No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.\")\n\nAdditionally, as pointed out by Carl Hempel (1905–1997), this simple view of the scientific method is incomplete; a conjecture can also incorporate probabilities, e.g., the drug is effective about 70% of the time. Tests, in this case, must be repeated to substantiate the conjecture (in particular, the probabilities). In this and other cases, we can quantify a probability for our confidence in the conjecture itself and then apply a Bayesian analysis, with each experimental result shifting the probability either up or down. Bayes' theorem shows that the probability will never reach exactly 0 or 100% (no absolute certainty in either direction), but it can still get very close to either extreme. See also confirmation holism.\n\nQualification of corroborating evidence is sometimes raised as philosophically problematic. The raven paradox is a famous example. The hypothesis that 'all ravens are black' would appear to be corroborated by observations of only black ravens. However, 'all ravens are black' is logically equivalent to 'all non-black things are non-ravens' (this is the contraposition form of the original implication). 'This is a green tree' is an observation of a non-black thing that is a non-raven and therefore corroborates 'all non-black things are non-ravens'. It appears to follow that the observation 'this is a green tree' is corroborating evidence for the hypothesis 'all ravens are black'. Attempted resolutions may distinguish:\n\nEvidence contrary to a hypothesis is itself philosophically problematic. Such evidence is called a falsification of the hypothesis. However, under the theory of confirmation holism it is always possible to save a given hypothesis from falsification. This is so because any falsifying observation is embedded in a theoretical background, which can be modified in order to save the hypothesis. Popper acknowledged this but maintained that a critical approach respecting methodological rules that avoided such \"immunizing stratagems\" is conducive to the progress of science.\n\nPhysicist Sean Carroll claims the model ignores underdetermination.\nThe hypothetico-deductive model (or approach) versus other research models\n\nThe hypothetico-deductive approach contrasts with other research models such as the inductive approach or grounded theory. In the data percolation methodology, \nthe hypothetico-deductive approach is included in a paradigm of pragmatism by which four types of relations between the variables can exist: descriptive, of influence, longitudinal or causal. The variables are classified in two groups, structural and functional, a classification that drives the formulation of hypotheses and the statistical tests to be performed on the data so as to increase the efficiency of the research. \n\n"}

He was considered the \"de facto\" leader (1926–35) of the Second Polish Republic as the Minister of Military Affairs. From World War I he had great power in Polish politics and was a distinguished figure on the international scene. He is viewed as a father of the Second Polish Republic re-established in 1918, 123 years after the 1795 Partitions of Poland by Austria, Prussia and Russia.\n\nDeeming himself a descendant of the culture and traditions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Piłsudski believed in a multi-ethnic Poland—\"a home of nations\" including indigenous ethnic and religious minorities that he hoped would establish a robust union with the independent states of Lithuania and Ukraine. His principal political antagonist, Roman Dmowski, leader of the National Democrat party, by contrast, called for a Poland limited to the pre-Partitions Polish Crown and based mainly on a homogeneous ethnically Polish population and Roman Catholic identity.\n\nEarly in his political career, Piłsudski became a leader of the Polish Socialist Party. Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won militarily, he formed the Polish Legions. In 1914 he correctly predicted the outbreak of a major war, the Russian Empire's defeat by the Central Powers, and the Central Powers' defeat by the western Allies. When World War I began in 1914, Piłsudski's Legions fought alongside Austria-Hungary against Russia. In 1917, with Imperalist Russia faring poorly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers and was imprisoned in Magdeburg by the Germans.\n\nFrom November 1918, when Poland regained its independence, until 1922, Piłsudski was Poland's Chief of State. In 1919–21 he commanded Polish forces in six border wars that re-defined the country's borders. His forces seemed on the verge of defeat in the Polish–Soviet War when, in the August 1920 Battle of Warsaw, they threw back the invading Soviet Russian forces. In 1923, with the government dominated by his opponents, in particular the National Democrats, Piłsudski retired from active politics. Three years later he returned to power in the May 1926 \"coup d'état\" and became Poland's strongman. From then on until his death in 1935, he concerned himself primarily with military and foreign affairs.\n\nIn international affairs, Piłsudski pursued two complementary strategies meant to secure Poland's independence and to enhance her national security: \"Prometheism\", aimed at achieving the disintegration of Imperialist Russia and later the Soviet Union into their constituent nations; and the creation of an Intermarium federation of Central and Eastern European states lying between the Baltic and Black Seas; serving as a bridge between Germany and Russia. The proposed Intermarium's central purpose was to secure its peoples against Western and Eastern European imperialisms.\n\nHistorian Piotr Wandycz characterizes Piłsudski as \"an ardent Polish patriot who on occasion would castigate the Poles for their stupidity, cowardice, or servility. He described himself as a Polish-Lithuanian, and was stubborn and reserved, loath to show his emotions.\" Though some aspects of Piłsudski's administration remain controversial, he is highly esteemed in Polish memory and is regarded, together with his chief antagonist Roman Dmowski, as a founder of the modern independent Poland.\n\nHe was born 5 December 1867 to the noble family Piłsudski, at their manor named \"Zułów\", near the village of Zułowo (now Zalavas, Švenčionys district municipality, Lithuania), in the Russian Empire since 1795 on the territory of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The estate was part of the dowry brought by his mother, Maria, a member of the wealthy Billewicz family. The Piłsudski family, although pauperized, cherished Polish patriotic traditions and has been characterized either as Polish or as Polonized-Lithuanian. Józef was the second son born to the family.\nJózef, when he attended the Russian \"gymnasium\" in \"Wilno\" (now Vilnius, Lithuania), was not an especially diligent student. One of the younger Polish students at this gymnasium was the future Russian communist leader Feliks Dzierżyński, who later would become Piłsudski's arch-enemy. Along with his brothers Bronisław, Adam and Jan, Józef was introduced by his mother Maria, \"née\" Billewicz, to Polish history and literature, which were suppressed by the Russian authorities. His father, likewise named Józef, had fought in the January 1863 Uprising against Russian rule of Poland.\nThe family resented the Russian government's Russification policies. Young Józef profoundly disliked having to attend Russian Orthodox Church service and left school with an aversion not only for the Russian Tsar and the Russian Empire, but for the culture, which he knew well.\n\nIn 1885 Piłsudski started medical studies at Kharkov University (now Kharkiv, Ukraine), where he became involved with \"Narodnaya Volya\", part of the Russian \"Narodniki\" revolutionary movement. In 1886, he was suspended for participating in student demonstrations. He was rejected by the University of Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia), whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation. On 22 March 1887, he was arrested by Tsarist authorities on a charge of plotting with Vilnius socialists to assassinate Tsar Alexander III. In fact, Piłsudski's main connection to the plot was the involvement of his elder brother Bronisław, who was sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor (\"katorga\") in eastern Siberia.\n\nJózef received a milder sentence: five years' exile in Siberia, first at Kirensk on the Lena River, then at Tunka. While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Piłsudski was held for several weeks at a prison in Irkutsk. There, he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt. After one of the inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance; Piłsudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident. For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment. He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him throughout life.\n\nDuring his years of exile in Siberia, Piłsudski met many \"Sybiraks\", including Bronisław Szwarce, who had almost become a leader of the January 1863 Uprising. He was allowed to work in an occupation of his own choosing, and earned his living tutoring local children in mathematics and foreign languages (he knew French, German and Lithuanian in addition to Russian and his native Polish; he would later learn English). Local officials decided that as a Polish noble he was not entitled to the 10-ruble pension received by most other exiles.\n\nIn 1892 Piłsudski returned from exile and settled in Adomavas Manor near Teneniai (now in Šilalė district). In 1893 he joined the Polish Socialist Party (\"PPS\") and helped organize its Lithuanian branch. Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible internationalism he remained a Polish nationalist. In 1894, as its chief editor, he began publishing an underground socialist newspaper, \"Robotnik\" (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a typesetter. In 1895, he became a PPS leader and took the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.\n\nOn 15 July 1899, while an underground organizer, Piłsudski married a fellow socialist organizer, Maria Juszkiewiczowa, \"née\" Koplewska. According to his chief biographer, Wacław Jędrzejewicz, the marriage was less romantic than pragmatic in nature. Both were very involved in the socialist and independence movements. The printing press of \"Robotnik\" was in their apartment first in Wilno, then in Łódź. Having a pretext of regular family life made them less subject to suspicion. Russian law also protected a wife from prosecution for the illegal activities of her husband. The marriage deteriorated when, several years later, Piłsudski began an affair with a younger socialist, Aleksandra Szczerbińska. Maria died in 1921, and in October that year Piłsudski married Aleksandra. By then the couple had two daughters, Wanda and Jadwiga.\nIn February 1900, after Russian authorities found \"Robotnik\"'s underground printing press in Łódź, Piłsudski was imprisoned at the Warsaw Citadel. But, after feigning mental illness in May 1901, he managed to escape from a mental hospital at Saint Petersburg with the help of a Polish physician, Władysław Mazurkiewicz, and others, fleeing to Galicia, then part of Austria-Hungary and thence to Leytonstone in London where he stayed with Leon Wasilewski and his family.\n\nAt the time, when almost all parties in Russian Poland and Lithuania took a conciliatory position toward the Russian Empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for Poland, Piłsudski's PPS was the only political force that was prepared to fight the Empire for Polish independence and to resort to violence in order to achieve that goal.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), in the summer of 1904, Piłsudski traveled to Tokyo, Japan, where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain that country's assistance for an uprising in Poland. He offered to supply Japan with intelligence in support of its war with Russia, and proposed the creation of a Polish Legion from Poles, conscripted into the Russian Army, who had been captured by Japan. He also suggested a \"Promethean\" project directed at breaking up the Russian Empire, a goal that he later continued to pursue. Meeting with Yamagata Aritomo, he suggested that starting a guerrilla war in Poland would distract Russia and asked for Japan to supply him with weapons. Although the Japanese diplomat Hayashi Tadasu supported the plan, the Japanese government, including Yamagata, was more skeptical.\n\nPiłsudski's arch-rival Roman Dmowski travelled to Japan, where he argued against Piłsudski's plan, endeavoring to discourage the Japanese government from supporting a Polish revolution, which Dmowski felt would then be doomed to failure. Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain Piłsudski's political archenemy to the end of Piłsudski's life. In the end, the Japanese offered Piłsudski much less than he had hoped for; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and its combat organisation, and the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.\n\nIn the fall of 1904, Piłsudski formed a paramilitary unit (the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party, or \"bojówki\") aiming to create an armed resistance movement against the Russian authorities. The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in Warsaw; on 28 October 1904, Russian Cossack cavalry attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Piłsudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military. Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.\n\nDuring the Russian Revolution of 1905, Piłsudski played a leading role in events in Congress Poland. In early 1905 he ordered the PPS to launch a general strike there; it involved some 400,000 workers and lasted two months until it was broken by the Russian authorities. In June 1905, Piłsudski sent paramilitary aid to an uprising in Łódź. During the \"June Days\", as the Łódź uprising came to be known, armed clashes broke out between Piłsudski's paramilitaries and gunmen loyal to Dmowski and his National Democrats. On 22 December 1905, Piłsudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; the call went largely unheeded.\n\nUnlike the National Democrats, Piłsudski instructed the PPS to boycott the elections to the First Duma. The decision and his resolve to try to win Polish independence through uprisings caused tensions within the PPS, and in November 1906, the party fractured over Piłsudski's leadership. His faction came to be called the \"Old Faction\" or \"Revolutionary Faction\" (\"\"Starzy\" or \"Frakcja Rewolucyjna\"\"), while their opponents were known as the \"Young Faction\", \"Moderate Faction\" or \"Left Wing\" (\"\"Młodzi\", \"Frakcja Umiarkowana\", \"Lewica\"\"). The \"Young\" sympathized with the Social Democrats of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania and believed that priority should be given to co-operation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the tsarist regime and creating a socialist utopia that would facilitate negotiations for independence.\n\nPiłsudski and his supporters in the Revolutionary Faction continued to plot a revolution against Tsarist Russia that would secure Polish independence. By 1909, his faction would again be the majority in the PPS, and Piłsudski would remain one of the most important PPS leaders until the outbreak of the First World War.\n\nPiłsudski anticipated a coming European war and the need to organize the nucleus of a future Polish Army, which could help win Poland's independence from the three empires that had partitioned it out of political existence in the late 18th century. In 1906 Piłsudski, with the connivance of the Austrian authorities, founded a military school in Kraków for the training of paramilitary units. In 1906 alone, the 800-strong paramilitaries, operating in five-man teams in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; in subsequent years, the number of their casualties declined, and the paramilitaries' numbers increased to some 2,000 in 1908.\n\nThe paramilitaries also held up Russian currency transports that were leaving Polish territories. On the night of 26/27 September 1908, they robbed a Russian mail train that was carrying tax revenues from Warsaw to Saint Petersburg. Piłsudski, who took part in this Bezdany raid near Vilnius, used the funds thus \"expropriated\" to finance his secret military organization. The take from that single raid (200,812 rubles) was a fortune for the time and equaled the paramilitaries' entire takes of the two preceding years.\n\nIn 1908, Piłsudski transformed his paramilitary units into an \"Association for Active Struggle\" (\"Związek Walki Czynnej\", or \"ZWC\"), headed by three of his associates, Władysław Sikorski, Marian Kukiel and Kazimierz Sosnkowski. One of the \"ZWC\"'s main purposes was to train officers and noncommissioned officers for a future Polish Army.\n\nIn 1910, two legal paramilitary organizations were created in the Austrian zone of Poland, one in Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine) and one in Kraków, to conduct training in military science. With the permission of the Austrian authorities, Piłsudski founded a series of \"sporting clubs\", then the Riflemen's Association, which served as cover to train a Polish military force. In 1912 Piłsudski (using the \"nom de guerre\", \"Mieczysław\") became commander-in-chief of a Riflemen's Association (\"Związek Strzelecki\") that grew by 1914 to 12,000 men. In 1914, Piłsudski declared, \"Only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation.\"\n\nAt a meeting in Paris in 1914, Piłsudski presciently declared that in the impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by France, Britain and the United States. By contrast, Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's rival, believed that the best way to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the Triple Entente against the Central Powers.\n\nAt the outbreak of the war on 3 August in Kraków, Piłsudski formed a small cadre military unit, the First Cadre Company, from members of the Riflemen's Association and Polish Rifle Squads. That same day, a cavalry unit under Władysław Belina-Prażmowski was sent to reconnoitre across the Russian border even before the official declaration of war between Austria-Hungary and Russia, which ensued on 6 August.\n\nPiłsudski's strategy was to send his forces north across the border into Russian Poland into an area that the Russian Army had evacuated in the hope of breaking through to Warsaw and sparking a national uprising. Using his limited forces in those early days, he backed his orders with the sanction of a fictitious \"National Government in Warsaw\", and he bent and stretched Austrian orders to the utmost, taking initiatives, moving forward and establishing Polish institutions in liberated towns while the Austrians saw his forces as good only for scouting or for supporting main Austrian formations. On 12 August 1914, Piłsudski's forces took the town of Kielce, of Kielce Governorate, but Piłsudski found the populace less supportive than he had expected.\n\nSoon afterward he officially established the Polish Legions, taking personal command of their First Brigade, which he would lead successfully into several victorious battles. He also secretly informed the British government in the fall of 1914 that his Legions would never fight France or Britain, only Russia.\n\nPiłsudski decreed that Legions' personnel were to be addressed by the French Revolution-inspired \"Citizen\" (\"Obywatel\"), and he was referred to as \"the Commandant\" (\"Komendant\"). Piłsudski enjoyed extreme respect and loyalty from his men, which would remain for years to come. The Polish Legions fought against Russia, at the side of the Central Powers, until 1917.\n\nSoon after forming the Legions, also in 1914, Piłsudski set up another organization, the Polish Military Organisation (\"Polska Organizacja Wojskowa\"), which served as a precursor Polish intelligence agency and was designed to perform espionage and sabotage missions.\n\nIn mid-1916, after the Battle of Kostiuchnówka (4–6 July 1916), in which the Polish Legions delayed a Russian offensive at a cost of over 2,000 casualties, Piłsudski demanded for the Central Powers to issue a guarantee of independence for Poland. He backed that demand with his own proffered resignation and that of many of the Legions' officers. On 5 November 1916 the Central Powers proclaimed the \"independence\" of Poland, hoping to increase the number of Polish troops that could be sent to the Eastern Front against Russia, thereby relieving German forces to bolster the Western Front.\n\nPiłsudski agreed to serve in the Regency Kingdom of Poland, created by the Central Powers, and acted as minister of war in the newly formed Polish Regency government; as such, he was responsible for the Polnische Wehrmacht. After the Russian Revolution in early 1917, and in view of the worsening situation of the Central Powers, Piłsudski took an increasingly uncompromising stance, insisting that his men no longer be treated as \"German colonial troops\" and but be used to fight only Russia. Anticipating the Central Powers' defeat in the war, he did not wish to be allied with the losing side. In the aftermath of a July 1917 \"Oath Crisis\" when Piłsudski forbade Polish soldiers to swear a loyalty oath to the Central Powers, he was arrested and imprisoned at Magdeburg; the Polish units were disbanded and the men were incorporated into the Austro-Hungarian Army while the Polish Military Organization began attacking German targets. Piłsudski's arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among Poles, many of whom began to see him as the most determined Polish leader, who was willing to take on all the partitioning powers.\n\nOn 8 November 1918, three days before the Armistice, Piłsudski and his colleague, Colonel Kazimierz Sosnkowski, were released by the Germans from Magdeburg and soon, like Vladimir Lenin before them, placed on a private train, bound for their national capital, as the collapsing Germans hoped that Piłsudski would create a force that was friendly to them.\n\nOn 11 November 1918 in Warsaw, Piłsudski was appointed Commander in Chief of Polish forces by the Regency Council and was entrusted with creating a national government for the newly independent country. On that very day, which would become Poland's Independence Day, he proclaimed an independent Polish state.\n\nThat week too, Piłsudski also negotiated the evacuation of the German garrison from Warsaw and of other German troops from the \"Ober Ost\" authority. Over 55,000 Germans would peacefully depart Poland, leaving their weapons to the Poles. In coming months, over 400,000 total would depart Polish territories.\n\nOn 14 November 1918, Piłsudski was asked to supervise provisionally the running of the country. On 22 November he officially received, from the new government of Jędrzej Moraczewski, the title of Provisional Chief of State (\"Naczelnik Państwa\") of renascent Poland.\n\nVarious Polish military organizations and provisional governments (the Regency Council in Warsaw; Ignacy Daszyński's government in Lublin; and the Polish Liquidation Committee in Kraków) bowed to Piłsudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the Polish Socialist Party, such as the eight-hour day, free school education and women's suffrage, to avoid major unrest.\n\nHowever, Piłsudski believed that as head of state, he must be above partisan politics. The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as \"Comrade\" (\"Towarzysz\") and asked for his support for their revolutionary policies; he refused it and answered: \"Comrades, I took the red tram of socialism to the stop called Independence, and that's where I got off. You may keep on to the final stop if you wish, but from now on let's address each other as 'Mister' [rather than continue using the socialist term of address, 'Comrade']!\" He declined to support any party and did not form any political organization of his own; instead, he advocated creating a coalition government. He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.\n\nIn the days immediately after the war, Piłsudski attempted to build a government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%. A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: \"I have nowhere seen anything like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn.\"\n\nIn addition, the country had to unify the disparate systems of law, economics, and administration in the former German, Austrian, and Russian sectors of Poland. There were nine legal systems, five currencies, and 66 types of rail systems (with 165 models of locomotives), which all had to be consolidated on an expedited basis.\nWacław Jędrzejewicz, in \"Piłsudski: A Life for Poland\", described Piłsudski as very deliberate in his decision-making: Piłsudski collected all available pertinent information, then took his time weighing it before arriving at a final decision. He drove himself hard, working all day and all night. He maintained a simple lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant. Though he was popular with much of the Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work) and as a man who distrusted almost everyone led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.\n\nPiłsudski and the first Polish government were distrusted in the West because he had co-operated with the Central Powers in 1914 to 1917 and because the governments of Daszyński and Jędrzej Moraczewski were primarily socialist. It was not until January 1919, when the world-famous pianist and composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski became Prime Minister of Poland and foreign minister of a new government, that it was recognized in the West.\n\nThat still left two separate governments claiming to be Poland's legitimate government: Piłsudski's in Warsaw and Dmowski's in Paris. To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Piłsudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Piłsudski acting as Provisional Chief of State and Commander-in-Chief while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the Paris Peace Conference. Articles 87–93 of the Treaty of Versailles and the Little Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, formally established Poland as an independent and sovereign state in the international arena.\nPiłsudski often clashed with Dmowski for viewing the Poles as the dominant nationality in renascent Poland, and attempting to send the Blue Army to Poland through Danzig, Germany (now Gdańsk, Poland). On 5 January 1919, some of Dmowski's supporters (Marian Januszajtis-Żegota and Eustachy Sapieha) attempted a coup against Piłsudski and Prime Minister Moraczewski, but they failed.\n\nOn 20 February 1919, Piłsudski declared that he would return his powers to the newly elected Polish parliament (\"Sejm\"). However, the \"Sejm\" reinstated his office in the Little Constitution of 1919. The word \"Provisional\" was struck from his title, and Piłsudski would hold the office until 9 December 1922, when Gabriel Narutowicz was elected as the first president of Poland.\n\nPiłsudski's major foreign policy initiative was then a proposed federation (to be called \"Międzymorze\" (Polish for \"Between-Seas\"), and also known from the Latin as \"Intermarium\", stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea). It was to consist of Poland, the independent Baltic states, Belarus, and Ukraine, somewhat in emulation of the pre-partition Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nPiłsudski's plan met with opposition from most of the prospective member states, which refused to relinquish any of their hard-won independence, as well as from the Allied powers, who thought it to be too bold a change to the existing balance-of-power structure. According to historian George Sanford, it was around 1920 that Piłsudski came to realize the infeasibility of that version of his Intermarium project.\n\nInstead of a Central and Eastern European alliance, there soon appeared a series of border conflicts, including the Polish-Ukrainian War (1918–19), the Polish-Lithuanian War (1920, culminating in Żeligowski's Mutiny), Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts (beginning in 1918), and most notably the Polish-Soviet War (1919–21). Winston Churchill commented, \"The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies begun.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of World War I, there was unrest on all Polish borders. Regarding Poland's future frontiers, Piłsudski said, \"All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente—on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany\". In the east, \"there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far\". In 1918 in the east, Polish forces clashed with Ukrainian forces in the Polish–Ukrainian War, and Piłsudski's first orders as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, on 12 November 1918, were to provide support for the Polish struggle in Lviv.\n\nPiłsudski was aware that the Bolsheviks were no friends of independent Poland and that war with them was inevitable. He viewed their advance west as a major problem, but he also considered the Bolsheviks less dangerous for Poland than their White opponents. The \"White Russians\", representatives of the old Russian Empire, were willing to accept only limited independence for Poland, probably within borders similar to those of the former Congress Poland, and they clearly objected to Polish control of Ukraine, which was crucial for Piłsudski's Intermarium project.\n\nThat was in contrast to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Lenin's struggling Bolshevik government, Piłsudski probably saved it in the summer and the fall of 1919.\nIn the wake of the Russian westward offensive of 1918–1919 and of a series of escalating battles that resulted in the Poles advancing eastward, on 21 April 1920, Marshal Piłsudski (as his rank had been since March 1920) signed a military alliance (the Treaty of Warsaw) with Ukrainian leader Symon Petliura to conduct joint operations against Soviet Russia. The goal of the Polish-Ukrainian Treaty was to establish an independent Ukraine and independent Poland in alliance, resembling that once existing within Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth In return, Petliura gave up Ukrainian claims to western lands of Galicia being a historical part of the Crown of Poland for which he was denounced by Ukrainian nationalist leaders.\n\nThe Polish and the Ukrainian Armies, under Piłsudski's command, launched a successful offensive against the Russian forces in Ukraine. On 7 May 1920, with remarkably little fighting, they captured Kiev.\n\nThe Bolshevik leadership framed the Polish actions as an invasion; in response, thousands of officers and deserters joined the Red Army, and thousands of civilians volunteered for war work. The Soviets launched a counter-offensive from Belarus and counterattacked in Ukraine, advancing into Poland in a drive toward Germany to encourage the Communist Party of Germany in its struggle to take power. Soviet confidence soared. The Soviets announced their plans to invade Western Europe; Soviet communist theoretician Nikolai Bukharin, writing in \"Pravda\", hoped for the resources to carry the campaign beyond Warsaw \"straight to London and Paris\". Soviet commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky's order of the day for 2 July 1920 read: \"To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to worldwide conflagration. March upon Vilnius, Minsk, Warsaw!\" and \"onward to Berlin over the corpse of Poland!\"\n\nOn 1 July 1920, in view of the rapidly advancing Soviet offensive, Poland's parliament, the \"Sejm\", formed a Council for Defense of the Nation, chaired by Piłsudski, to provide expeditious decision-making as a temporary supplanting of the fractious Sejm. The National Democrats, however, contended that the string of Bolshevik victories had been Piłsudski's fault and demanded that for him to resign; some even accused him of treason. Their 19 July failure to carry a vote of no-confidence in the council led to Dmowski's withdrawal from it. On 12 August, Piłsudski tendered his resignation to Prime Minister Wincenty Witos, offering to be the scapegoat if the military solution failed, but Witos refused to accept his resignation. The Entente pressured Poland to surrender and enter into negotiations with the Bolsheviks. Piłsudski, however, was a staunch advocate of continuing the fight. As Norman Davies noted, at that time, especially abroad, \"Piłsudski had nothing of his later prestige. As a pre-war revolutionary he led his party to splits and quarrels; as a general in World War I he led his legions to internment and disbanding; as a marshal of the Polish Army he led it to Kiev and Vilnius, both now lost to Poles. He left the Polish Socialist Party and his Austro-German allies; refused to ally himself with Entente. In France and England he was considered a treasonous ally who leads Poland into destruction; in Russia he was seen as a false servant of the allies, who will lead imperialism to ruin. All – from Lenin to Lloyd George, from \"Pravda\" to \"Morning Star\" – considered him a military and political failure. In August 1920 all were in agreement that his catastrophic career will be crowned with the fall of Warsaw\".\n\nHowever, over the next few weeks, Poland's risky, unconventional strategy at the August 1920 Battle of Warsaw halted the Soviet advance. The Polish plan was developed by Piłsudski and others, including Tadeusz Rozwadowski. Later, some supporters of Piłsudski would seek to portray him as the sole author of the Polish strategy, but opponents would seek to minimize his role. In the West for a long time a myth persisted that it was General Maxime Weygand of the French Military Mission to Poland who had saved Poland; modern scholars, however, are in agreement that Weygand's role was minimal, at best.\n\nPiłsudski's plan called for Polish forces to withdraw across the Vistula River and to defend the bridgeheads at Warsaw and on the Wieprz River while some 25% of the available divisions concentrated to the south for a strategic counteroffensive. The plan next required two armies under General Józef Haller, facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, to hold their entrenched positions at all costs. At the same time, an army under General Władysław Sikorski was to strike north from outside Warsaw, cutting off Soviet forces that sought to envelope the Polish capital from that direction. The most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small, approximately 20,000-man, newly assembled \"Reserve Army\" (also known as the \"Strike Group\", \"Grupa Uderzeniowa\"), comprising the most determined, battle-hardened Polish units that were commanded personally by Piłsudski. Their task was to spearhead a lightning northward offensive, from the Vistula-Wieprz triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot that had been identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern Fronts. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski's army and the \"Strike Group\" would close near the East Prussian border, bringing about the destruction of the encircled Soviet forces.\n\nAt the time, Piłsudski's plan was strongly criticized, and only the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders to go along with it. Though based on reliable intelligence, including decrypted Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed \"amateurish\" by high-ranking army officers and military experts, who were quick to point out Piłsudski's lack of formal military education. When a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Western Front commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky thought it to be a ruse and disregarded it. Days later, the Soviets paid dearly for that when, during the Battle of Warsaw, the overconfident Red Army suffered one of its greatest defeats ever.\n\nA National Democrat \"Sejm\" deputy, Stanisław Stroński, coined the phrase, \"Miracle at the Vistula\" (\"Cud nad Wisłą\"), to express his disapproval of Piłsudski's \"Ukrainian adventure\". Stroński's phrase was adopted as praise for Piłsudski by some patriotically- or piously-minded Poles, who were unaware of Stroński's ironic intent. A junior member of the French military mission, Charles de Gaulle, would later adopt some lessons from the Polish-Soviet War as well as from Piłsudski's career.\n\nIn February 1921, Piłsudski visited Paris, where, in negotiations with French President Alexandre Millerand, he laid the foundations for the Franco-Polish Military Alliance, which would be signed later that year. The Treaty of Riga, which ended the Polish-Soviet War in March 1921, partitioned Belarus and Ukraine between Poland and Russia. Piłsudski called the treaty an \"act of cowardice\". The treaty and his secret approval of General Lucjan Żeligowski's capture of Vilnius from the Lithuanians marked an end to this incarnation of Piłsudski's federalist Intermarium plan.\n\nOn 25 September 1921, when Piłsudski visited Lwów (now Lviv) for the opening of the first Eastern Trade Fair (\"Targi Wschodnie\"), he was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt by Stepan Fedak, acting on behalf of Ukrainian-independence organizations, including the Ukrainian Military Organization.\n\nAfter the Polish Constitution of March 1921 severely limited the powers of the presidency intentionally, to prevent a President Piłsudski from waging war. He declined to run for the office. On 9 December 1922, the Polish National Assembly elected Gabriel Narutowicz of Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"; his election, opposed by the right-wing parties, caused public unrest. On 14 December at the Belweder Palace, Piłsudski officially transferred his powers as Chief of State to his friend Narutowicz; the \"Naczelnik\" was replaced by the President.\n\nTwo days later, on 16 December 1922, Narutowicz was shot dead by a right-wing painter and art critic, Eligiusz Niewiadomski, who had originally wanted to kill Piłsudski but had changed his target, influenced by National Democrat anti-Narutowicz propaganda.\n\nFor Piłsudski, that was a major shock, which shook his belief that Poland could function as a democracy and made him support government by a strong hand. He became Chief of the General Staff and, together with Minister of Military Affairs Władysław Sikorski, managed to stabilize the situation, quelling unrest with a brief state of emergency.\n\nStanisław Wojciechowski of Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (PSL Piast), another of Piłsudski's old colleagues, was elected the new president, and Wincenty Witos, also of PSL Piast, became prime minister. However, the new government, pursuant to the Lanckorona Pact, an alliance among the centrist PSL Piast and the right-wing Popular National Union and Christian Democrat parties, contained right-wing enemies of Piłsudski, people whom he held morally responsible for Narutowicz's death and with whom he found it impossible to work. On 30 May 1923, Piłsudski resigned as Chief of the General Staff.\n\nAfter General Stanisław Szeptycki proposed that the military should be more closely supervised by civilian authorities, Piłsudski criticized that as an attempt to politicize the army, and on 28 June, he resigned his last political appointment. The same day, the Sejm's left-wing deputies voted a resolution, thanking him for his past work. Piłsudski went into retirement in Sulejówek, outside Warsaw, at his country manor, \"Milusin\", which had been presented to him by his former soldiers. There, he settled down to supporting his family by writing a series of political and military memoirs, including \"Rok 1920\" (The Year 1920).\nMeanwhile, Poland's economy was in shambles. Hyperinflation fueled public unrest, and the government was unable to find a quick solution to the mounting unemployment and economic crisis. Piłsudski's allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics, and he began to create a new power base, centred on former members of the Polish Legions and the Polish Military Organization as well as some left-wing and intelligentsia parties. In 1925, after several governments had resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Piłsudski became more and more critical of the government and eventually issued statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet.\n\nWhen the Chjeno-Piast coalition, which Piłsudski had strongly criticized, formed a new government, on 12–14 May 1926, Piłsudski returned to power in a \"coup d'état\" (the May Coup), supported by the Polish Socialist Party, Liberation, the Peasant Party and even the Polish Communist Party. Piłsudski had hoped for a bloodless coup, but the government had refused to back down; 215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed, and over 900 persons had been wounded.\n\nOn 31 May, the \"Sejm\" elected Piłsudski president of the Republic. Piłsudski, however, aware of the presidency's limited powers, refused the office. Another of his old friends, Ignacy Mościcki, was elected in his stead. Mościcki then appointed Piłsudski as Minister of Military Affairs (defence minister), a post that he would hold for the rest of his life in 11 successive governments, two of which he headed himself from 1926 to 1928 and for a brief period in 1930. He also served as General Inspector of the Armed Forces, and Chairman of The War Council.\n\nPiłsudski had no plans for major reforms; he quickly distanced himself from the most radical of his left-wing supporters and declared that his coup was to be a \"revolution without revolutionary consequences\". His goals were to stabilize the country; reduce the influence of political parties, which he blamed for corruption and inefficiency; and strengthen the army. His role in the Polish government over the subsequent years has been called a dictatorship or a \"quasi-dictatorship\".<\n\nIn internal politics, Piłsudski's coup entailed sweeping limitations on parliamentary government, as his Sanation regime (1926–1939), at times employing authoritarian methods, sought to \"restore public life to moral health\". From 1928, the Sanation authorities were represented in the sphere of practical politics by the Non-partisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government (\"BBWR\"). Popular support and an effective propaganda apparatus allowed Piłsudski to maintain his authoritarian powers, which could not be overruled either by the president, who was appointed by Piłsudski, or by the \"Sejm\". The powers of the \"Sejm\" were curtailed by constitutional amendments that were introduced soon after the coup, on 2 August 1926. From 1926 to 1930, Piłsudski relied chiefly on propaganda to weaken the influence of opposition leaders.\n\nThe culmination of his dictatorial and supralegal policies came in the 1930s, with the imprisonment and trial of certain political opponents (the Brest trials) on the eve of the 1930 legislative elections and with the 1934 establishment of a prison for political prisoners at Bereza Kartuska (today Biaroza), where some prisoners were brutally mistreated. After the \"BBWR\"s 1930 victory, Piłsudski left most internal matters in the hands of his \"colonels\" while he concentrated on military and foreign affairs. He came under considerable criticism for his treatment of political opponents and their 1930 arrest and imprisonment was internationally condemned and damaged Poland's reputation.\n\nPiłsudski became increasingly disillusioned with democracy in Poland. His intemperate public utterances (he called the \"Sejm\" a \"prostitute\") and his sending of 90 armed officers into the \"Sejm\" building in response to an impending vote of no-confidence caused concern in contemporary and modern observers who have seen his actions as setting precedents for authoritarian responses to political challenges.\n\nOne of his main goals was to transform the parliamentary system into a presidential system; however, he opposed the introduction of totalitarianism. The adoption of a new Polish constitution in April 1935 that was tailored by Piłsudski's supporters to his specifications, providing for a strong presidency, came too late for Piłsudski to seek that office; but the April Constitution would serve Poland up to the outbreak of World War II and would carry its Government in Exile until the end of the war and beyond.\n\nNonetheless, Piłsudski's government depended more on his charismatic authority than on rational-legal authority. None of his followers could claim to be his legitimate heir, and after his death, the Sanation structure would quickly fracture, returning Poland to the pre-Piłsudski era of parliamentary political contention.\n\nPiłsudski's regime began a period of national stabilization and of improvement in the situation of ethnic minorities, which formed about a third of the Second Republic's population. Piłsudski replaced the National Democrats' \"ethnic-assimilation\" with a \"state-assimilation\" policy: citizens were judged not by their ethnicity but by their loyalty to the state. Widely recognized for his opposition to the National Democrats' anti-Semitic policies, he extended his policy of \"state-assimilation\" to Polish Jews. The years 1926 to 1935 and Piłsudski himself were favorably viewed by many Polish Jews whose situation improved especially under Piłsudski-appointed Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel. Many Jews saw Piłsudski as their only hope for restraining antisemitic currents in Poland and for maintaining public order; he was seen as a guarantor of stability and a friend of the Jewish people, who voted for him and actively participated in his political bloc. Piłsudski's death in 1935 brought a deterioration in the quality of life of Poland's Jews.\n\nDuring the 1930s, a combination of developments, from the Great Depression to the vicious spiral of \"OUN\" terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate. Unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in the largely-Ukrainian eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose between the government and Poland's German minority, particularly in Upper Silesia. The government did not yield to calls for antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the Depression. Overall, by the end of Piłsudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.\n\nIn the military sphere, Piłsudski, who had shown himself an accomplished military strategist in engineering the \"Miracle at the Vistula\", has been criticized by some for subsequently concentrating on personnel management and allegedly neglecting modernization of military strategy and equipment. His experiences in the Polish-Soviet War (1919–1921) may have led him to overestimate the importance of cavalry and to neglect the development of armoured and air forces. Others, however, contend that, particularly from the late 1920s, he had supported the development of these military branches. The limitations on Poland's military modernization in this period may have been less doctrinal than financial.\n\nUnder Piłsudski, Poland maintained good relations with neighboring Romania, Hungary and Latvia. Relations were strained with Czechoslovakia, however, and even worse with Lithuania. Relations with Weimar Germany and the Soviet Union varied over time, but during Piłsudski's tenure could, for the most part, be described as neutral.\n\nPiłsudski's Promethean programme to weaken the Russian Empire and its successor state, the Soviet Union, by supporting nationalist independence movements of major non-Russian peoples dwelling in Russia and the Soviet Union, was co-ordinated from 1927 to the 1939 outbreak of World War II in Europe by the military intelligence officer, Edmund Charaszkiewicz. In the interbellum, but it yielded few tangible results.\n\nPiłsudski sought to maintain his country's independence in the international arena. Assisted by his protégé, Foreign Minister Józef Beck, he sought support for Poland in alliances with western powers, such as France and the United Kingdom, and with friendly, if less powerful, neighbours, such as Romania and Hungary.\n\nA supporter of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the Polish-Romanian Alliance, part of the Little Entente, Piłsudski was disappointed by the French and British policy of appeasement evident in their signing of the Locarno Treaties. Piłsudski, therefore, aimed also to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union and Germany and so Poland signed non-aggression pacts with both of its powerful neighbours: the 1932 Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. Both were meant to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbours.\n\nPiłsudski himself was acutely aware of the shakiness of the pacts, and he commented: \"Having these pacts, we are straddling two stools. This cannot last long. We have to know from which stool we will tumble first, and when that will be\". Critics of the two non-aggression pacts have accused Piłsudski of underestimating Hitler's aggressiveness, of giving Germany time to rearm and of allowing Stalin to eliminate opposition, primarily in Ukraine, which had been supported by Piłsudski's Promethean program.\n\nAfter Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have proposed to France a preventive war against Germany. It has been argued that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany. Lack of French interest may have been a reason for Poland signing the Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced.\n\nHitler repeatedly suggested a German-Polish alliance against the Soviet Union, but Piłsudski declined, instead seeking precious time to prepare for potential war with either Germany or the Soviet Union. Just before his death, Piłsudski told Józef Beck that it must be Poland's policy to maintain neutral relations with Germany, keep up the Polish alliance with France and improve relations with the United Kingdom.\n\nPiłsudski's religious views are a matter of debate. He was baptised on 15 December 1867 in the church of Powiewiórka (then Sventsiany deanery) by the priest, Thomas Valinsky. His godparents were Joseph and Constance Martsinkovsky Ragalskaya.\n\nHe periodically changed his religious affiliation from Roman Catholicism to Lutheranism, and back.\n\nOn 15 July 1899, at the village of Paproć Duża, near Łomża, he married Maria Piłsudska, a divorcée. As the Catholic Church did not recognise divorces, she and Piłsudski had converted to Protestantism.\n\nPilsudski later returned to the Catholic Church in order to marry Aleksandra Piłsudska. Piłsudski and Aleksandra could not get married as Piłsudski's wife Maria refused to divorce him. It was only after Maria's death in 1921 that they were married, on 25 October of the same year.\n\nAfter the May coup, Piłsudski considered himself a Roman Catholic, but he did not appear to be religious and often used religion as a public tool. Piłsudski was quoted saying:\nAfter the coup and Piłsudski's reign as dictator, he often clashed with Catholic leaders but nevertheless enjoyed a good working relationship with Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski, who subsequently led his funeral mass. In 1937, Archbishop of Kraków, Adam Stefan Sapieha, ordered to move Piłsudski's coffin from St. Leonard's Crypt to Royal Tombs at Wawel. This led to open conflict with the church and the government, which threatened to step down.\n\nBy 1935, unbeknownst to the public, Piłsudski had for several years been in declining health. On 12 May 1935, he died of liver cancer at Warsaw's Belweder Palace. The celebration of his life began spontaneously within half an hour of the announcement of his death. It was led by military personnel — former Legionnaires, members of the Polish Military Organization, veterans of the wars of 1919–21 — and by his political collaborators from his service as Chief of State and, later, Prime Minister and Inspector-General.\n\nThe Polish Communist Party immediately attacked Piłsudski as a fascist and capitalist, though fascists themselves did not see him as one of them. Other opponents of the Sanation regime, however, were more civil; socialists (such as Ignacy Daszyński and Tomasz Arciszewski) and Christian Democrats (represented by Ignacy Paderewski, Stanisław Wojciechowski and Władysław Grabski) expressed condolences. The peasant parties split in their reactions (Wincenty Witos voicing criticism of Piłsudski, but Maciej Rataj and Stanisław Thugutt being supportive), while Roman Dmowski's National Democrats expressed a toned-down criticism.\n\nCondolences were expressed by the clergy, including Poland's Primate August Hlond, as well as by Pope Pius XI, who called himself a \"personal friend\" of Piłsudski. Notable appreciation for Piłsudski was expressed by Poland's ethnic and religious minorities. Eastern Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Protestant, Judaic and Islamic organizations expressed condolences, praising Piłsudski for his policies of religious tolerance. His death was a shock to members of the Jewish minority, who even years after remembered him as a \"very good man\" who \"protected Jews\".\n\nMainstream organizations of ethnic minorities similarly expressed their support for his policies of ethnic tolerance, though he was criticized by, in addition to the Polish communists, the Jewish Labour Bund, and Ukrainian, German and Lithuanian extremists.\n\nOn the international scene, Pope Pius XI held a special ceremony 18 May in the Holy See, a commemoration was conducted at League of Nations Geneva headquarters, and dozens of messages of condolence arrived in Poland from heads of state across the world, including Germany's Adolf Hitler, the Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin, Italy's Benito Mussolini and King Victor Emmanuel III, France's Albert Lebrun and Pierre-Étienne Flandin, Austria's Wilhelm Miklas, Japan's Emperor Hirohito, and Britain's King George V.\n\nCeremonies, masses and an enormous funeral were held; a funeral train toured Poland. A series of postcards, stamps and postmarks was also released. In 1937, after a two-year display at St. Leonard's Crypt in Kraków's Wawel Cathedral, Piłsudski's body was laid to rest in the Cathedral's Crypt under the Silver Bells, except for his brain, which he had willed for study to Stefan Batory University, and his heart, which was interred in his mother's grave at Vilnius' Rasos Cemetery, where it remains.\n\nThe 1937 relocation of his remains, made by his long-standing adversary Adam Sapieha, then Archbishop of Krakow, incited widespread protests that included calls for Sapieha's removal.\n\nOn 13 May 1935, in accordance with Piłsudski's last wishes, Edward Rydz-Śmigły was named by Poland's president and government to be Inspector-General of the Polish Armed Forces, and on 10 November 1936, he was elevated to Marshal of Poland. Rydz was now one of the most powerful people in Poland, the \"second man in the state after the President\". While many saw Rydz-Śmigły as a successor to Piłsudski, he never became as influential.\n\nAs the Polish government became increasingly authoritarian and conservative, the Rydz-Śmigły faction was opposed by that of the more moderate Ignacy Mościcki, who remained President. After 1938 Rydz-Śmigły reconciled with the President, but the ruling group remained divided into the \"President's Men\", mostly civilians (the \"Castle Group\", after the President's official residence, Warsaw's Royal Castle), and the \"Marshal's Men\" (\"Piłsudski's Colonels\"), professional military officers and old comrades-in-arms of Piłsudski's. After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, some of this political division would survive within the Polish government in exile.\nPiłsudski had given Poland something akin to what Henryk Sienkiewicz's Onufry Zagłoba had mused about: a Polish Oliver Cromwell. As such, the Marshal had inevitably drawn both intense loyalty and intense vilification.\n\nIn 1935, at Piłsudski's funeral, President Mościcki eulogized the Marshal: \"He was the king of our hearts and the sovereign of our will. During a half-century of his life's travails, he captured heart after heart, soul after soul, until he had drawn the whole of Poland within the purple of his royal spirit ... He gave Poland freedom, boundaries, power and respect.\"\n\nAfter World War II, little of Piłsudski's thought influenced the policies of the Polish People's Republic, a \"de facto\" satellite of the Soviet Union. In particular, Poland was in no position to resume Piłsudski's effort to build an \"Intermarium\" federation of Poland and some of its neighbors; and a \"Promethean\" endeavor to \"break up the Russian state into its main constituents and emancipate the countries that have been forcibly incorporated into that empire.\"\n\nFor a decade after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or condemned by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar Second Polish Republic. This began to change, however, particularly after de-Stalinization and the Polish October (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.\n\nAfter the fall of communism and the 1991 disintegration of the Soviet Union, Piłsudski once again came to be publicly acknowledged as a Polish national hero. On the sixtieth anniversary of his death, on 12 May 1995, Poland's \"Sejm\" adopted a resolution: \"Józef Piłsudski will remain, in our nation's memory, the founder of its independence and the victorious leader who fended off a foreign assault that threatened the whole of Europe and its civilization. Józef Piłsudski served his country well and has entered our history forever.\"\n\nWhile some of Piłsudski's political moves remain controversial—particularly the May 1926 Coup d'état, the Brest trials (1931–32), the 1934 establishment of the Bereza Kartuska detention camp, and successive Polish governments' failure to formulate consistent, constructive policies toward the national minorities—Piłsudski continues to be viewed by most Poles as a providential figure in the country's 20th-century history.\nPiłsudski has lent his name to several military units, including the 1st Legions Infantry Division and armored train No. 51 (\"I Marszałek\"—\"the First Marshal\").\n\nAlso named for Piłsudski have been Piłsudski's Mound, one of four man-made mounds in Kraków; the Józef Piłsudski Institute of America, a New York City research center and museum on the modern history of Poland; the Józef Piłsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw; a passenger ship, ; a gunboat, ; and a racehorse, \"Pilsudski\". Virtually every Polish city has its \"Piłsudski Street\". (There are, by contrast, few if any streets named after Piłsudski's National-Democrat arch-rival, Roman Dmowski, even in Dmowski's old Greater-Poland political stronghold). There are statues of Piłsudski in many Polish cities; the highest density of such statuary memorials is found in Warsaw, which has three in little more than a mile between the Belweder Palace, Piłsudski's residence, and Piłsudski Square.\n\nHe was the subject of paintings by renowned artists such as Jacek Malczewski (1916) and Wojciech Kossak (leaning on his sword, 1928; and astride his horse, \"Kasztanka\", 1928), as well as of numerous caricatures and photos.\n\nPiłsudski has been a character in numerous works of fiction, such as the 1922 novel \"Generał Barcz\" (General Barcz) by Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski and the 2007 novel \"Ice\" (\"Lód\") by Jacek Dukaj. Poland's National Library lists over 500 publications related to Piłsudski; the U.S. Library of Congress, over 300. Piłsudski's life was the subject of a 2001 Polish television documentary, \"Marszałek Piłsudski\", directed by Andrzej Trzos-Rastawiecki.\n\nBoth daughters of Marshal Piłsudski returned to Poland in 1990, after the fall of the Communist system. Jadwiga Piłsudska's daughter Joanna Jaraczewska returned to Poland in 1979. She married a Polish \"Solidarity\" activist Janusz Onyszkiewicz in a political prison in 1983. Both were very involved in the Polish struggle against communism between 1979 and 1989.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. Józef Klemens Piłsudski was commonly referred to without his middle name, as \"Józef Piłsudski\". A few English sources translate his first name as \"Joseph\", but this is not the common practice. As a young man, he belonged to underground organizations and used various pseudonyms, including \"\"Wiktor\", \"Mieczysław\" and \"Ziuk\" (the latter also being his family nickname). Later he was often affectionately called \"Dziadek\"\" (\"Grandpa\" or \"the Old Man\") and \"Marszałek\" (\"the Marshal\"). His ex-soldiers from the Legions also referred to him as \"Komendant\" (\"the Commandant\").\n\nb. Piłsudski sometimes spoke of being a Lithuanian of Polish culture. For several centuries, declaring both Lithuanian and Polish identity was not self-excluding alike in case of master of Polish poetry Adam Mickiewicz. The question of Piłsudski's ethnicity and culture simply does not match contemporary templates, the more the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth which Piłsudski regarded as his spiritual \"patria\" failed to reborn itself and finally ceased to exist in the wake of arising modern nationalisms. Timothy Snyder, who calls him a \"Polish-Lithuanian\", notes that Piłsudski did not think in terms of 20th-century nationalisms and ethnicities; he considered himself \"both\" a Pole and a Lithuanian, and his homeland was the historic Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\n\n\n"}

It is currently on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species. The rat grows to 260 grams and feeds on fruit, leaves and buds. It has a gray-brown back and white belly, chest, and throat, and a hairy tail. Only 6500 animals were thought to remain in North Key Largo in the late 1980s.\n\nAlthough a 1923 article described woodrat nests on Key Largo, the form was not scientifically described until 1955, when H.B. Sherman described it as \"Neotoma floridana smalli\", a subspecies of the widespread eastern woodrat (\"Neotoma floridana\"). In 1987, Lazell suggested that it is distinct enough to be considered a separate species, but this proposal has not been accepted. The mitochondrial DNA of Key Largo woodrats is distinct by at least 0.6% from that of the most similar subspecies, the Florida woodrat (\"Neotoma floridana floridana\") from further north in Florida, but members of that subspecies differ about as much from each other as from the Key Largo woodrat.\n\nThe Key Largo woodrat is similar to the Florida woodrat (\"Neotoma floridana floridana\") and cannot be distinguished from it in size or external anatomy. It differs in the shape of the sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the palate), which are narrower and shorter than in \"N. f. floridana\". On average, males are a bit larger than females. In the holotype, an adult male, total length is , tail length , hindfoot length , ear length , dimensions of the testis , and mass is .\n\nThe animal is found exclusively in the northern part of Key Largo, at least 210 km removed from its nearest kin, the Florida woodrat. It is endemic to the tropical hardwood hammocks of Key Largo, where its habitat has shrunk by half since the 1920s, and the remainder is fragmented, thinned, and developed. It retains some 850 ha, most of which is in the Dagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park and the adjacent Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThe Key Largo woodrat builds nests out of sticks; these nests can be as high as a man's shoulder. They are handed down from generation to generation, and some are possibly centuries old.\n\nSince the Key Largo woodrat has a small and specific habitat, it is susceptible to human encroachment. Since the 1920s, it has lost almost half of its traditional habitat. In the early 1980s, biologists began equipping rats with radio devices to count them and study them; by the end of the 1980s, a study showed that the rat had disappeared from Key Largo proper and its total population had dwindled to some 6500 animals on North Key Largo. Its fate in Key Largo was tied to that of the American Crocodile, and when a planned reservation for the crocodile in North Key Largo bogged down during the presidential transition in the US Administration in 1980, the woodrat was threatened with extinction; the crocodile reservation was to be a haven for the woodrat, and also for the rare Schaus Swallowtail butterfly. A project called Port Bougainville, with 15 hotels besides condos, would add 45,000 inhabitants to North Key Largo by the year 2000, adding to the pressure on the crocodile and other animals.\n\nThe project, which by 1982 included a planned 2806 units, ran into opposition from environmental groups and by 1984 had ground to a halt after one of the investors withdrew a $54 million investment. in 1983 already, the administration had intervened and declared the Key Largo woodrat and the Key Largo cotton mouse endangered on a \"temporary emergency basis\"; the developer of a golf course, for instance, was ordered to restore the area he was illegally developing, to preserve the woodrat's habitat. Since 1984, the Key Largo woodrat is on the United States list of endangered species, along with the Schaus Swallowtail and the Key Largo Cotton Mouse.\n\nBy the 1990s, the animal's habitat had shrunk to about three square miles, and the Key Largo woodrat was called \"one of the rarest creatures on earth.\" The animal also suffers from competition with the infamous \"Rattus rattus\".\n\nAs of 2005, the Key Largo woodrat population was still struggling to survive among the half-built condominiums of the former Port Bougainville project, which in 2003 became part of the Dagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park. of the developer's land were bought up by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1987; the Botanical State Park now takes up . Besides in this area, the rat finds refuge in the Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which has a captive breeding program currently in operation but increasing development continues to threaten the animal.\n\nThe threat to many threatened species but especially the woodrat and the cotton mouse generated broad interest in the Florida keys in the 1980s, with many environmental groups being formed. Anna Dagny Johnson (1918–2003), a well-known environmentalist, led efforts by the Upper Keys Citizens Association, Friends of the Everglades, and the Izaak Walton League to stop development around North Key Largo; the Florida Division of Recreation and Parks honored her by naming the Dagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park for her, a year before she died.\n\nThe rat's habit of building large nests (\"4ft by 6ft homes\") was seen as proof that \"even wildlife in Florida want enormous homes.\" Novelist Lydia Millet paid homage to the woodrat in her 2008 novel \"How the Dead Dream\", a story of a young real estate developer from Los Angeles who, after some personal turmoil, takes an obsessive interest in vanishing species. A 1997 collection of poetry and prose by a writers cooperative from Key West features a poem (\"The Place We Live\" by Robin Orlandi) in which the woodrat is mentioned as one of three \"endangered native species,\" alongside the Key deer and the Stock Island Snail, \"Orthalicus reses reses\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2110105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110105", "title": "MONIAC", "text": "MONIAC\n\nThe MONIAC (Monetary National Income Analogue Computer) also known as the Phillips Hydraulic Computer and the Financephalograph, was created in 1949 by the New Zealand economist Bill Phillips (William Phillips) to model the national economic processes of the United Kingdom, while Phillips was a student at the London School of Economics (LSE). The MONIAC was an analogue computer which used fluidic logic to model the workings of an economy. The MONIAC name may have been suggested by an association of money and ENIAC, an early electronic digital computer.\n\nThe MONIAC was approximately 2 m high, 1.2 m wide and almost 1 m deep, and consisted of a series of transparent plastic tanks and pipes which were fastened to a wooden board. Each tank represented some aspect of the UK national economy and the flow of money around the economy was illustrated by coloured water. At the top of the board was a large tank called the treasury. Water (representing money) flowed from the treasury to other tanks representing the various ways in which a country could spend its money. For example, there were tanks for health and education. To increase spending on health care a tap could be opened to drain water from the treasury to the tank which represented health spending. Water then ran further down the model to other tanks, representing other interactions in the economy. Water could be pumped back to the treasury from some of the tanks to represent taxation. Changes in tax rates were modeled by increasing or decreasing pumping speeds.\n\nSavings reduce the funds available to consumers and investment income increases those funds. The MONIAC showed this by draining water (savings) from the expenditure stream and by injecting water (investment income) into that stream. When the savings flow exceeds the investment flow, the level of water in the savings and investment tank (the surplus-balances tank) would rise to reflect the accumulated balance. When the investment flow exceeds the savings flow for any length of time, the surplus-balances tank would run dry. Import and export were represented by water draining from the model, and by additional water being poured into the model.\n\nThe actual flow of the water was automatically controlled through a series of floats, counterweights, electrodes and cords. When the level of water reached a certain level in a tank, pumps and drains would be activated. To their surprise, Phillips and his associate Walter Newlyn found that MONIAC could be calibrated to an accuracy of ±2%.\n\nThe flow of water between the tanks was determined by economic principles and the settings for various parameters. Different economic parameters, such as tax rates and investment rates, could be entered by setting the valves which controlled the flow of water about the computer. Users could experiment with different settings and note the effect on the model. The MONIAC’s ability to model the subtle interaction of a number of variables made it a powerful tool for its time.\nWhen a set of parameters resulted in a viable economy the model would stabilise and the results could be read from scales. The output from the computer could also be sent to a rudimentary plotter.\n\nMONIAC had been designed to be used as a teaching aid but was discovered also to be an effective economic simulator. At the time that MONIAC was created, electronic digital computers that could run complex economic simulations were unavailable. In 1949, the few computers in existence were restricted to government and military use. Neither did they have adequate visual display facilities, so were unable to illustrate the operation of complex models. Observing the MONIAC in operation made it much easier for students to understand the interrelated processes of a national economy. The range of organisations that acquired a MONIAC showed that it was used in both capacities.\n\nPhillips scrounged a variety of materials to create his prototype computer, including bits and pieces from war surplus such as parts from old Lancaster bombers. The first MONIAC was created in his landlady’s garage in Croydon at a cost of £400 ().\n\nPhillips first demonstrated the MONIAC to a number of leading economists at the LSE in 1949. It was very well received and Phillips was soon offered a teaching position at the LSE.\n\nIt is thought that twelve to fourteen machines were built. \n\n\n\n\n"}

The Master Jesus is regarded by Theosophists, was regarded by Alice Bailey and was later regarded by students of the \"Ascended Master Teachings\" as the Master of the Sixth Ray.\n\nIt is believed by Ascended Master Teachings organizations that the Master Jesus was \"Chohan of the Sixth Ray\" until December 31, 1959, when, according to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Lady Master Nada fully took on that Office in the Spiritual Hierarchy. According to Prophet, Jesus became World Teacher, along with Kuthumi, on January 1, 1956, succeeding Maitreya, who took the Office of \"Planetary Buddha\" and \"Cosmic Christ\". This belief is not accepted by adherents of traditional Theosophy and the followers of Alice A. Bailey and Benjamin Creme; they believe that the Master Jesus is still the Chohan of the Sixth Ray and that Maitreya is still the World Teacher.\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the Prophet of the Church Universal and Triumphant, the largest Ascended Master Teachings religion, the Master Jesus incarnated twice as the Emperor of Atlantis, once in 33,050 BC and again in 15,000 BC. He did this in order to aid the white magicians in the war of the white magicians and the black magicians that was going on in Atlantis at that time.\n\nAccording to Alice A. Bailey, the Master Jesus was previously incarnated as Joshua, the Hebrew military leader in the 13th century BC, and Joshua the High Priest in the sixth century BC.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, Jesus was also incarnated as Joseph of the coat of many colors in the 17th century BC/16th century BC (approximately between 1650 BC and 1550 BC), as well as King David (who lived c. 1037 BC until around 970 BC), and Elisha in the 9th century BC.\n\nIt is believed in the Ascended Master Teachings that Jesus’ father Saint Joseph was one of the incarnations of St. Germain, and that his mother Mary, upon her Assumption became either a deva or an archangel and is now the twin flame (celestial wife) of the Archangel Raphael.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, each of the Magi who came to visit the baby Jesus was an incarnation of one of the ascended masters: Caspar, who gave the gift of gold to Jesus, was an incarnation of Djwal Khul; Balthasar, who gave the gift of frankincense to Jesus, was an incarnation of Kuthumi; and Melchior, who gave the gift of myrrh to Jesus, was an incarnation of Morya.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, to prepare for his ministry, Jesus first studied at the \"Brotherhood of Luxor\" (a mystery school in Egypt), and then went to India to study under the \"Great Divine Director\", Maitreya, and \"Lord Himalaya\", the Manu of the Fourth Root Race (Atlantean).\n\nAfter returning from India, while living in Judea, Jesus worked as a carpenter; his father Joseph helped him get work because he was a general contractor.\n\nThe followers of Benjamin Creme and Alice A. Bailey believe in the Nestorian/Gnostic Christology, promulgated by C.W. Leadbeater, which asserts that the powerful being known as the Maitreya overshadowed the Master Jesus during the Ministry of Jesus, such that there were two beings in one body. Maitreya was the Christ and the Master Jesus was Jesus of Nazareth; the combination of the two beings functioned as Jesus Christ. Those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings believe in the existence of the Maitreya; however, they believe that although he encouraged the mission of Jesus, he did not actually overshadow Jesus.\n\nTheosophists and those adherent to the \"Ascended Master Teachings\" alike believe that the Master Jesus underwent the fourth level of initiation (the \"crucifixion\") at his crucifixion in Jerusalem. According to Alice A. Bailey, for most people at the fourth initiation the crucifixion is symbolic as a severe life test of renunciation, but for Jesus it was literal.\n\n\"Ascended Master Teachings\" organizations adhere to the traditional Christian view that Jesus resurrected and ascended with his own physical body. Some with backgrounds in traditional Theosophy, the writings of Alice A. Bailey, and Benjamin Creme believe that Jesus resurrected from the body that he had when he incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana, although they do believe he ascended on the 3 day—they believe he had a body functioning at the fourth level of initiation when he ascended and not a fifth level body.\n\nTraditional theosophists believe that the Master Jesus and Maitreya souls' separated from each other just after the Ascension (which for Jesus was only to the fourth and not the fifth level of initiation) and do not believe that the Master Jesus went to Kashmir; they believe he went directly to Shamballa to be with the Lord of the World, Sanat Kumara, for a time, until he then incarnated again soon after as Apollonius of Tyana.\n\nIt is believed in the Ascended Master Teachings that when Jesus ascended on the 3rd day after the resurrection, he levitated from Judaea to Kashmir.\n\nIn either case, whether he went directly to Shamballa or to Kashmir when he ascended, presumably he teleported to a location above Judaea briefly ten days later on the 50th day after his resurrection in order to observe from afar the events of the Day of Pentecost (or possibly he observed these events by remote viewing). In both traditional Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings it is believed that these events were coordinated by the Maha Chohan, who, it is asserted by both C.W. Leadbeater and Elizabeth Clare Prophet, is the representative of the Holy Ghost on Earth.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that the Master Jesus lived in Kashmir until he was 81, and then, assuming he had been born in 6 BC, in AD 75, he ascended to Shamballa to be with the Lord of the World, Sanat Kumara.\n\nHelena Blavatsky, a founder of the Theosophical Society, wrote in 1877: \"Apollonius, a contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth, was, like him, an enthusiastic founder of a new spiritual school. Perhaps less metaphysical and more practical than Jesus, less tender and perfect in his nature, he nevertheless inculcated the same quintessence of spirituality, and the same high moral truths.\" Some Theosophists such as C.W. Leadbeater and the teachers of Neo-Theosophy, Alice A. Bailey and Benjamin Creme, have written that the Master Jesus was also incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana after his incarnation as Jesus of Nazareth. It is believed that he attained the fifth level of initiation (the \"resurrection\") when he became an Ascended Master at the end of his life as Apollonius of Tyana. However, if Apollonius was a contemporary of Jesus as Blavatsky wrote, Jesus could not have reincarnated as him. Benjamin Creme gets around this by claiming that Jesus lived from 24 BC to AD 9 (instead of the usual dates given of Jesus' lifetime as being c. 6 BC to c. AD 30 or AD 33). This means that Jesus \"could\" have incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana, since according to Creme, Apollonius lived from AD 16 to c. AD 97. However, one of the possible chronologies of Apollonius of Tyana's life sometimes cited give his life span as being from AD 40 to AD 120, thus making it possible that, even if the usual dates of Jesus' lifetime are accepted (c. 6 BC to c. AD 30 or AD 33), he \"still\" could have incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana. However, other modern scholarship, more often cited, gives the dates of Appolonius' life span as c. AD 15 to c. AD 100, thus making it problematic, realistically speaking, that Jesus could have incarnated as him.\n\nJesus' incarnation as Apollonius of Tyana is accepted by the followers of traditional Theosophy, of Alice A. Bailey, and of Benjamin Creme, but not by those who are adherent to the \"Ascended Master Teachings\", who believe that the incarnation as Jesus was his last embodiment on Earth.\n\nC.W. Leadbeater stated that the Master Jesus, after his resurrection in the body of Apollonius of Tyana, incarnated in India as the Tamil religious reformer Ramanuja, a leading figure within the Bhakti movement in Hinduism; thus, by incarnating as Ramanuja, Jesus became an Avatar. According to Leadbeater, the Master Jesus incarnated as Ramanuja as part of his spiritual work as Master of the Sixth Ray of Love-Devotion (\"bhakti\" is the Sanskrit word for \"devotion\").\n\nThat Jesus incarnated as Ramanuja is believed by many traditional Theosophists, but not by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings.\n\nAccording to Benjamin Creme, the Master Jesus visited the Americas (as well as Polynesia) not immediately after his resurrection as recounted in the Book of Mormon, but in the late 7th century and early 8th century, after having descended to the continent of America from his dwelling place in Shamballah with Sanat Kumara. Like the Mormons, Creme believes that this visit gave rise to the legend of Quetzalcoatl.\n\nBenjamin Crème asserted that, in the late 1970s, the Master Jesus appeared to Spencer W. Kimball, then president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the Washington D.C. Temple.\n\nCreme stated that since 1990 the Master Jesus has been living in secret in Rome. After Maitreya makes his Emergence (the \"Day of Declaration\"), Creme asserted, the Master Jesus in his immortal body will assume the papal throne for the next 2,000 years of the Age of Aquarius.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Jesus has a sumptuous retreat (residence on the etheric plane) above Jerusalem called the \"Resurrection Temple\". Often his mother Mary (now married to the Archangel Raphael, as noted above, and serving the Solar Logos with him in the solar corona) descends to serve with him at the Resurrection Temple doing sacred rituals and answering prayers.\n\nAscended Master Teachings groups describe the Master Jesus as having a \"twin flame\" (celestial spouse) named Lady Master Magda, one of whose two known incarnations was Mary Magdalene; the other was Aimee Semple McPherson.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, the Ascended Master John the Beloved, who was Jesus’ best friend during his lifetime, has a retreat (residence on the etheric plane) above Arizona where he teaches a variety of white magic that involves the mastery of the elemental spirits governing the realms of earth, air, water, and fire. It is believed that the Master Jesus often teleports over to John the Beloved's retreat to say hello to his old friend.\n\nIn the teachings of the Aetherius Society, headquartered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, it is promulgated that since his resurrection, the Master Jesus has been dwelling mostly on the higher planes of Venus in order to work with the Master Aetherius, but when his presence is required, he teleports to or takes a flying saucer to Earth as needed.\n\nThe noted Ascended Master Teachings teacher Joshua David Stone (whose organization, the I AM University, was originally headquartered near San Luis Obispo, California), began holding his Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings in 1996. Stone had begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that the Master Jesus, under his galactic name \"Sananda\" (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with Commander Ashtar, flying with Pallas Athena in their own flying saucer within the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet as its Commander-in-Chief. According to Stone, another name used by Commander Ashtar to denote his flying saucer fleet is \"The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood\". It is believed that Ashtar is originally from a planet called Ashtar, but he moved to Venus thousands of years ago. It is said that he formed the Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet at the beginning of the Atomic Age in 1945 and that in the early 1980s, at the behest of Sanat Kumara, Sananda (the Master Jesus) and Pallas Athena took over command of the fleet. Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings teacher Sheldan Nidle, who resides in the gold country in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in California, the Earth base of the Ashtar Galactic Command is known as the New Jerusalem or \"Shan Chea\". It is a square rotating space station with artificial gravity in constant orbit around Earth on the etheric plane, with orbit distances varying from approximately to . It is a large space station with a population of thousands of etheric beings. In the center of this square space station is a sphere connected by four tubes to the square outer ring of the space station. This sphere houses the Inn of Heaven, the command headquarters of Sananda, Lady Master Athena, and Ashtar. There is also a smaller round space station called \"Schare\" or \"Share\", where the individual flying saucers of the fleet piloted by those at the higher levels of the fleet command hierarchy dock to receive their orders and review their missions. Within the Inn of Heaven is a private retreat for Sananda (the Master Jesus) in addition to his retreat above Jerusalem. The Master Jesus has a landing pad for his flying saucer at his Jerusalem retreat.\n\nLourene Altiery, also known as \"Karita\" to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from Joliet, Illinois who now resides in Sun Lakes, Arizona. She set up her website in 2001. Like Joshua David Stone and Luis Prada, Altiery also teaches that Sananda has taken over as the Commander of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet with his co-commandress Pallas Athena and that Ashtar is now second in command. She also teaches that an alternate name used by Commander Sananda to denote the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet is \"The Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light\".\nIn addition, Lourene Altieri has revealed the names of and channeled information from some of the other prominent beings who she says travel with Commander Sananda, Pallas Athena, Ashtar, and Vrillon on the saucers of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet. These include :-\n\nAleph Nero, who's the main commander.\n\nAaron Alaje James, sub-commander of one of the wings of the fleet, working with a human from Earth, known as Miss Megan Sebastian who is visiting Earth to raise the consciousness of humanity and uplift the vibrations of Planet Gaia and Agartha. Also known as Megha or \"Meg\" from Alcorn, contributing to Stability and Peace over the Planet Om, and the Princess/Prayer Maiden of the Planet Anova.\n\nKorton, captain of the flying saucer, the fleet communications officer in charge of maintaining subspace communications for the fleet.\n\nEsola, captain of the flying saucer \"Starship #77\".\n\nMerku, of the planet Alcorn, subcommander of one of the wings of the fleet.\n\nSoltec, captain of the geophysics science survey flying saucer \"Phoenix\".\n\nVoltra, the \"space psychologist\", who monitors the \"vibratory level of humanity\".\n\nKla-La, \"master of force dynamics\".\n\nHatonn, who monitors events on Earth for the \"Galactic Hall of Records\" at the galactic core and the Lady Master Athena, the \"twin flame\" (celestial wife) of the Maha Chohan; Altieri teaches that the Lady Master Athena often personally accompanies Commander Sananda on board his command flying saucer.\n\nAaron Johnson James (sometimes called Lancelot) is the name given to an extraterrestrial being, a Nordic alien with whom some number of people claim to have had contact. He might be from the Great White Brotherhood, which is also known as the Great Brotherhood of Light or the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth, which is perceived as being a spiritual organization composed of those Ascended Masters who have risen from the Earth into immortality, but who still maintain an active watch over the habitable worlds. The Great White Brotherhood also includes members of the Heavenly Host (the Spiritual Hierarchy directly concerned with the evolution of our world), Beneficent Members from other planets. He may be connected to Modern Rosicrucianism and the Ascended Master Teachings, responsible for the New Age culture of the Age of Aquarius, and also to the UFO Religion Aetherius Society, whose headquarters is in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, although the 26 November 1977 Southern Television broadcast interruption must have a connection with his disappearance. Lancelot is currently working with \"Jesus Christ\" and Ashtar in the Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light, Sub-Commander of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet, \"working towards raising the consciousness of humanity and uplifting the vibrations of planet Earth\", Angels Teachings, The Master and the Path and is the representative of the Holy Ghost on Earth. Lancelot is said to be an extraterrestrial from the planet called Alcorn, which operates in the fourth sector of the Milky Way Galaxy – Olega, Quadra. He is said to be the crowned Prince of Alcorn, but for some reason he ran away from his planet and since then he is trespassing on earth and lives secretly in Agartha; he is working with the celestial beings whom humans worship as God on earth. Lancelot has a Nordic/Angelic (human-like) appearance and originates from the system that orbits The Constellation of Pleiades.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of Rapid City, South Dakota, the work of Hatonn\nfeeding information about events on Earth via subspace relay to the supercomputers at the \"Galactic Hall of Records\" is secondary to Hatonn's primary task (Hatonn is, she states, a Pleiadean), which is functioning as the liaison officer between Sanat Kumara and the Pleiadeans for the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate through the approaching photon belt.\n\nThe scholar K. Paul Johnson maintains that the \"Masters\" that Madame Blavatsky wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her mentors. In an article in the New York Times, Paul Zweig maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.\n\nHowever, the Master Jesus was never one of the \"Masters\" that Madame Blavatsky claimed to have met. He was added as a \"Master\" by Annie Besant and C.W. Leadbeater in their 1913 book \"\".\n\nPanelology\n\n\n\n"}

It looks at how a specific child, at a specific age—usually today, now—performs intellectually, compared to average intellectual performance for that physical age, measured in years. The physical age of the child is compared to the intellectual performance of the child, based on performance in tests and live assessments by a psychologist. Scores achieved by the child in question are compared to scores in the middle of a bell curve for children of the same age \n\nHowever, mental age varies according to what kind of intelligence is measured. A child's intellectual age can be average for his physical age but the same child's emotional intelligence can be immature for his physical age. In this psychologists often remark girls are more emotionally mature than boys in the tween years. Also, a six-year-old child intellectually gifted in Piaget terms can remain a three-year-old child in terms of emotional maturity. Mental age was once considered a controversial concept.\n\nDuring much of the nineteenth century, theories of intelligence focused on measuring the size of human skulls. Anthropologist well known for their attempts in correlating cranial size and capacity with intellectual potential are Samuel Morton and Paul Broca.\n\nThe modern theories of intelligence began to emerge along with experimental psychology. This is when much of psychology\nwas moving from philosophical to more biology and medical science basis. In 1890, James Cattell published what some \nconsider the first \"mental test\". Cattell was more focused on heredity rather than environment. This spurs much\nof the debate about the nature of intelligence. \nMental age was first defined by the French psychologist Alfred Binet, who introduced the intelligence test in 1905, with the assistance of Theodore Simon. Binet's experiments on French schoolchildren laid the framework for future experiments into the mind throughout the Twentieth Century. He created an experiment that was designed as a test to be completed quickly and was taken by various ages of children. As was expected, the older children performed better on these tests. However, the younger children who had exceeded the average of their peers were said to have a higher \"mental age\" and those who performed below average were deemed to have a lower mental age. Binet's theories suggested that while mental age was a useful indicator, it was by no means permanently affixed and individual growth or decline could be attributed to changes in teaching methods and experiences.\n\nHenry Herbert Goddard was the first psychologist to bring Binet's test to the United States. Goddard was amongst one of the many psychologists in the 1910s that believed intelligence was a fixed quantity. While Binet believed this wasn't the case, the majority of those in the U.S believed it was hereditary.\n\nThe limitations of the Stanford-Binet caused David Wechsler to publish the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) in \n1955. These two tests were split into two different ones for children. The WAIS-IV is the known current publication of the test\nfor adults. The reason for this test was to score the individual and compare it to others of the same age \ngroup rather than to score by chronological age and mental age. The fixed average is 100 and the normal range is between \n85 and 115. This is a standard currently used and is used in the Stanford-Binet test as well.\n\nOriginally, the differences between mental age and chronological age were used to compute the intelligence quotient, or IQ. This was computed using the ratio method, with the following formula: \nNo matter what the child's chronological age, if the mental age is the same as the chronological age, then the IQ will equal 100.\n\nModern intelligence tests, including the current Stanford-Binet test, no longer compute scores using the IQ formula. Instead, intelligence tests give a score that reflects how far the person's performance deviates from the average performance of others who are the same age, arbitrarily defined as an average score of 100.\n\nAn IQ or intelligence quotient, is a score derived from one of several different standardized tests designed to assess intelligence. The mental age is the age group which scored such a result on average.\n\nMental age, as well as IQ, have limitations. Binet did not believe these measures should be used for a single, permanent, and inborn level of intelligence. He stressed the limitation of the test because intelligence overall is too broad to be represented by a single number. It is influenced by many factors such as the individual's background and changes over time.\n\nThroughout much of the 20th century, many psychologists believed intelligence was fixed and hereditary while others believed other factors would affect intelligence.\n\nAfter World War I, the concept of intelligence as fixed, hereditary, and unchangeable became the dominant theory within \nthe experimental psychological community. By the mid-1930s, there was no longer agreement among researchers on whether or not\nintelligence was hereditary. There are still recurring debates about the influence of environment and heredity upon an individual's \nintelligence.\n\n"}
{"id": "43770701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43770701", "title": "Moral blindness", "text": "Moral blindness\n\nMoral blindness is a state of unawareness or insensibility to moral issues pertaining both to oneself and to one's relations to others. George Eliot considered that \"We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder to feed our supreme selves\". Healthy development leads away from early egotism to produce greater levels of awareness, leading to degrees of what Abraham Maslow called \"lesser blindness\".\n\nCritics question whether \"moral blindness\" is ever more than a useful weapon of debate with which to charge one's opponents.\n\nPhilosophically, moral blindness has been explored from Plato's tyrant onwards, through Epitectus and Kant, but came into full prominence with Ethical intuitionism. Figures like G. E. Moore argued for a \"direct moral awareness\" and saw moral blindness as the equivalent of colour blindness.\n\nMelanie Klein saw early development in terms of the child slowly emerging from a state of narcissistic blindness to recognise the motherer as a moral end in herself, not simply as the child's means or tool—a step she called the depressive position. D. W. Winnicott similarly saw the infant as moving from —from an unconcerned use of the mother to concerned usage.\n\nZygmunt Bauman considers certain features of 21st century society to actively promote moral blindness. A valorisation of commodities as ephemeral and exchangeable combines with the effect of internet anonymity to create a culture that tends to ignore of the particularity of the individual. Equally pernicious is the extension of a calculus of gain over ever-wider areas of life, to the exclusion of moral evaluation—the unchallenged moral blindness of the market.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "215883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215883", "title": "Necessity (criminal law)", "text": "Necessity (criminal law)\n\nIn the criminal law of many nations, necessity may be either a possible justification or an exculpation for breaking the law. Defendants seeking to rely on this defense argue that they should not be held liable for their actions as a crime because their conduct was \"necessary\" to prevent some greater harm and when that conduct is not excused under some other more specific provision of law such as self defense. Except for a few statutory exemptions and in some medical cases there is no corresponding defense in English law for murder.\n\nFor example, a drunk driver might contend that he drove his car to get away from a kidnap (cf. \"North by Northwest\"). Most common law and civil law jurisdictions recognize this defense, but only under limited circumstances. Generally, the defendant must affirmatively show (i.e., introduce some evidence) that (a) the harm he sought to avoid outweighs the danger of the prohibited conduct he is charged with; (b) he had no reasonable alternative; (c) he ceased to engage in the prohibited conduct as soon as the danger passed; and (d) he did not himself create the danger he sought to avoid. Thus, with the \"drunk driver\" example cited above, the necessity defense will not be recognized if the defendant drove further than was reasonably necessary to get away from the kidnapper, or if some other reasonable alternative was available to him.\n\nAs a matter of political expediency, states usually allow some classes of person to be excused from liability when they are engaged in socially useful functions but intentionally cause injury, loss or damage. For example, the fire services and other civil defence organizations have a general duty to keep the community safe from harm. If a fire or flood is threatening to spread out of control, it may be reasonably necessary to destroy other property to form a fire break, or to trespass on land to throw up mounds of earth to prevent the water from spreading. These examples have the common feature of individuals intentionally breaking the law because they believe it to be urgently necessary to protect others from harm, but some states distinguish between a response to a crisis arising from an entirely natural cause (an inanimate force of nature), e.g. a fire from a lightning strike or rain from a storm, and a response to an entirely human crisis. Thus, parents who lack the financial means to feed their children cannot use necessity as a defense if they steal food. The existence of welfare benefits and strategies other than self-help defeat the claim of an urgent necessity that cannot be avoided in any way other than by breaking the law. Further, some states apply a test of proportionality. So the defense would only be allowed where the degree of harm actually caused was a reasonably proportionate response to the degree of harm threatened. This is a legal form of cost–benefit analysis.\n\n\nEmergency law/right (\"nødret\", \"nødrett\") is the equivalent of necessity in Denmark and Norway. It is considered related to but separate from self-defence. Common legal examples of necessity includes: breaking windows and other objects in order to escape a fire, commandeering a vehicle to serve as an emergency ambulance, ignoring traffic rules while rushing a dying patient to a hospital, and even killing a person who poses an immediate threat to several other people not including yourself. In the last case self-defense laws are not enough, but the case is covered by \"nødret\". \"Nødret\" can only be invoked though when no other option is available.\n\nUnder international law, an obligation of customary international law or an obligation granted under a bilateral investment treaty may be suspended under the doctrine of necessity. It is \"an exception from illegality and in certain cases even as an exception from responsibility.\" \"See Continental Casualty Company v Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No ARB/03/09.\" \nIn order to invoke the doctrine of necessity:\n(1) The invoking State must not have contributed to the state of necessity,\n(2) Actions taken were the only way to safeguard an essential interest from grave and impending danger.\n\"Id. at page 72, paragraph 165.\"\n\nNecessity is a possible defense per the Criminal Code and the Administrative Penalty Act.\n\nNecessity as a defense to criminal acts conducted to meet political ends was rejected in the case of \"United States v. Schoon\". In that case, 30 people, including appellants, gained admittance to the IRS office in Tucson, where they chanted \"keep America's tax dollars out of El Salvador,\" splashed simulated blood on the counters, walls, and carpeting, and generally obstructed the office's operation. The court ruled that the elements of necessity did not exist in this case.\n\n\nNecessity is a defence per the Penal Code.\nThis requires lack of criminal intent, good faith (due care and attention), and the goal of preventing harm. The harm must be sufficiently serious and imminent to justify or excuse the act.\n\nIn Canada, Necessity is recognized as a defence for crimes committed in urgent situations of clear and imminent peril in which the accused has no safe or legal way out of the situation. \n\nThree Requirements for defence of necessity:\n(1) Urgent situation of imminent peril or danger \n(2) No reasonable legal alternative\n(3) Proportionality between harm inflicted and harm avoided\n\nIt should also be noted that the first and second element are evaluated on the modified objective standard.

{"id": "494275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=494275", "title": "On Kawara", "text": "On Kawara\n\nKawara was born in Kariya, Japan on December 24, 1932. After graduating from Kariya High School in 1951, Kawara moved to Tokyo. Kawara went to Mexico in 1959, where his father was the director of an engineering company. He stayed three years, painting, attending art school and exploring the country. From 1962 to 1964 he moved back and forth between New York and Paris. He travelled through Europe before settling in 1965 in New York City, where he was an intermittent resident until his death.\n\nKawara belonged to a broadly international generation of Conceptual artists that began to emerge in the mid-1960s, stripping art of personal emotion, reducing it to nearly pure information or idea and greatly playing down the art object. Along with Lawrence Weiner, Joseph Kosuth, Hanne Darboven and others, Kawara gave special prominence to language.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1964 Kawara made about 200 \"Paris-New York Drawings\". Their motifs include stripes and grids like those of the Minimalist painter Agnes Martin. Other drawings depict installation pieces that fill rooms with networks of string.\n\nFrom January 4, 1966, Kawara made a long series of \"Date paintings\" (the \"Today\" series), which consist entirely of the date on which the painting was executed in simple white lettering set against a solid background. The date is always documented in the language and grammatical conventions of the country in which the painting is executed (i.e., “26. ÁG. 1995,” from Reykjavik, Iceland, or “13 JUIN 2006,” from Monte Carlo); Esperanto is used when the first language of a given country does not use the Roman alphabet.\n\nThe paintings, executed in Liquitex on canvas, conform to one of eight standard sizes, ranging from 8x10 inches to 61x89 inches, all horizontal in orientation. The exceptions are the three paintings, roughly five by seven feet, executed on July 16, 20 and 21, 1969 — three days when the world was riveted by the moon landing.\n\nThe dates on the paintings, hand-painted with calculated precision, are always centered on the canvas and painted white, whereas the background colors vary; the paintings from the early years tend to have bold colors, and the more recent ones tend to be darker in tone. For example, Kawara briefly used red for several months in 1967 and then returned to darker hues until 1977. Four coats of paint are carefully applied for the ground and each allowed enough time to dry before being rubbed down in preparation for subsequent coats. Eschewing stencils in favor of hand-drawn characters, Kawara skillfully renders the script, initially a sans-serif, elongated version of Gill Sans, later a quintessentially modernist Futura. Each work is carefully executed by hand. Some days he made more than one. When Kawara was unable to complete the painting on the day it was started he immediately destroyed it. When a \"Date Painting\" is not exhibited, it is placed in a cardboard box custom-made for the painting, which is lined with a clipping from a local newspaper from the city in which the artist made the painting; most clippings are from \"The New York Times\". Although the boxes are part of the work, they are rarely exhibited. Each year between 63 and 241 paintings were made.\n\nEach \"Date Painting\" is registered in a journal and marked on a \"One Hundred Years Calendar\". When Kawara finished a painting, he applied a swatch of the paint mixture he used to a small rectangle that was then glued onto a chart in the journal. Under each colour is a number showing the painting's sequence in that year and a letter indicating its size. The 48 journals therefore record the details of the painting’s size, color and newspaper headline, while the calendar uses colored dots to indicate the days in which a painting was made, and to record the number of days since the artist’s birth. Kawara created nearly 3,000 date paintings in more than 112 cities worldwide in a project that was planned to end only with his death.\n\nMuch like the \"Today\" series, Kawara uses the number of days followed by the date the work was executed as his life-dates. So the piece entitled \"Title\" at the National Gallery of Art has Kawara's life-dates as 26,697 (January 27, 2006) which, when calculated, place Kawara's birthdate at December 24, 1932. Other series of works include the \"I Went and I Met\" series of postcards sent to his friends detailing aspects of his life, and a series of telegrams sent to various people bearing the message \"I AM STILL ALIVE\". Between 1968 and 1979, On Kawara created his information series, \"I Got Up\", in which he sent two picture postcards from his location on that morning. All of the 1,500 cards list the artist's time of getting up, the date, the place of residence and the name and address of the receiver another series of postcards, \"I Got Up At\", rubber-stamped with the time he got up that morning. The length of each correspondence ranged from a single card to hundreds sent consecutively over a period of months; the gesture's repetitive nature is counterbalanced by the artist's peripatetic global wanderings and exceedingly irregular hours (in 1973 alone he sent postcards from twenty-eight cities).\n\n\"One Million Years\" is one of the artist’s best-known works about the passage and marking of time. It lists each year for the one million-year period leading up to the artwork's conception and the million years that follow it. It is sometimes performed, during which pairs of performers (typically one male and one female for an each segment) read dates from each list in order, simultaneously performing \"One Million Years [Past]\" and \"One Million Years [Future]\".\n\nThe artwork was first made in 1969, the year of the Woodstock music festival, major civil protests against the Vietnam War and man's first landing on the moon. The first audio presentation of the reading of \"One Million Years\" occurred in 1993 during Kawara’s yearlong solo exhibition “One Thousand Days One Million Years” at Dia Center for the Arts in New York. Visitors could hear \"One Million Years [Future]\" being read, while viewing \"One Million Years [Past]\" and a group of date paintings. The longest public reading from \"One Million Years\" took place at \"documenta\" 11 in 2002, where male and female participants sat side by side in a glass enclosure taking turns reading dates for the duration of the 100-day exhibition, switching between \"[Past]\" and \"[Future]\". In 2004, the project traveled to Trafalgar Square in London for a continuous outdoor reading lasting 7 days and 7 nights. Since then, readings and recordings have taken place in cities around the world.\n\nFor his one-hundred-year calendars, Kawara, starting with the date of his birth, systematically marks each day of his life with a yellow dot on the calendars, and registers a completed date painting with a green dot (red dots signify that more than one painting was completed on that given day).\n\nIn \"Pure Consciousness,\" a traveling exhibition initiated in 1998, Kawara lent seven \"Date paintings\" (January 1 to January 7, 1997) to kindergartens and schools in Madagascar, Australia, Bhutan, Côte d'Ivoire, Colombia, Turkey, Japan, Finland, Iceland, Israel, and the United States. At all schools they hang in classrooms, bearing dates that fall within the lifespans of the children.\n\nKawara's first exhibitions include the first Nippon Exhibition, at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, in 1953, and at the Takemiya and Hibiya galleries the following year. His work was exhibited at New York's Dwan Gallery in 1967, and his one-person exhibition \"One Million Years\" was shown in Düsseldorf, Paris, and Milan in 1971. Kawara's work was included in \"documenta\" 5 (1972), 7 (1982), and 11 (2002), in Kassel, and in the Tokyo Biennale (1970), the Kyoto Biennale (1976), and the Venice Biennale (1976).\n\nHis work has been included in many conceptual art surveys from the seminal \"Information\" show at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1970 to \"Reconsidering the Object of Art: 1965-1975\" at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 1995. Solo exhibitions of his work have included the Otis Art Institute, Los Angeles, and the Centre Pompidou, Paris, in 1977; \"Continuity/Discontinuity\" at the Moderna Museet, Stockholm in 1980; Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam in 1991; the Dia Center for the Arts, New York in 1993; and the Dallas Museum of Art.\n\nKawara's first comprehensive retrospective, “On Kawara—Silence” at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, was installed in 12 sections according to a plan devised by himself. Two years before his death, the artist offered the exhibit’s curator Jeffrey Weiss a list of oblique titles—including “48 Years,” “Self-Observation” and “Monologue”—for each of the sections. The exhibition was held February 6 through May 3, 2015 and also featured a live reading of Kawara’s “One Million Years.”\n\nKawara created several artist's books:\n\nOn Kawara is represented by David Zwirner Gallery, New York and Yvon Lambert Gallery, Paris. In 2007, one of Kawaras \"Date Paintings\" was sold for $1.8 million at Christie's New York. Another date painting, \"May 1, 1987\", set an auction record for Kawara when it sold for almost $4.2 million at Christie's New York in 2014.\n\nHe died in New York on July 10, 2014 at the age of 81. Kawara's published obituaries state that he was alive for 29,771 days rather than giving dates of birth and death. Kawara's ″100 Years Calendar″ indicates that he was born on December 24, 1932, not on the 2nd of January 1933, as was officially recorded. This would make the date of his death, June 27, 2014.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24980", "title": "Punctuated equilibrium", "text": "Punctuated equilibrium\n\nPunctuated equilibrium (also called punctuated equilibria) is a theory in evolutionary biology which proposes that once species appear in the fossil record the population will become stable, showing little evolutionary change for most of its geological history. This state of little or no morphological change is called \"stasis\". When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.\n\nPunctuated equilibrium is commonly contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the idea that evolution generally occurs uniformly and by the steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages (called anagenesis). In this view, evolution is seen as generally smooth and continuous.\n\nIn 1972, paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould published a landmark paper developing their theory and called it \"punctuated equilibria\". Their paper built upon Ernst Mayr's model of geographic speciation, I. Michael Lerner's theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis, and their own empirical research. Eldredge and Gould proposed that the degree of gradualism commonly attributed to Charles Darwin is virtually nonexistent in the fossil record, and that stasis dominates the history of most fossil species.\n\nPunctuated equilibrium originated as a logical consequence of Ernst Mayr's concept of genetic revolutions by allopatric and especially peripatric speciation as applied to the fossil record. Although the sudden appearance of species and its relationship to speciation was proposed and identified by Mayr in 1954, historians of science generally recognize the 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper as the basis of the new paleobiological research program. Punctuated equilibrium differs from Mayr's ideas mainly in that Eldredge and Gould placed considerably greater emphasis on stasis, whereas Mayr was concerned with explaining the morphological discontinuity (or \"sudden jumps\") found in the fossil record. Mayr later complimented Eldredge and Gould's paper, stating that evolutionary stasis had been \"unexpected by most evolutionary biologists\" and that punctuated equilibrium \"had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology.\"\n\nA year before their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, Niles Eldredge published a paper in the journal \"Evolution\" which suggested that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr's standard mechanism of allopatric speciation might suggest a possible resolution.\n\nThe Eldredge and Gould paper was presented at the Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America in 1971. The symposium focused its attention on how modern microevolutionary studies could revitalize various aspects of paleontology and macroevolution. Tom Schopf, who organized that year's meeting, assigned Gould the topic of speciation. Gould recalls that \"Eldredge's 1971 publication [on Paleozoic trilobites] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject—so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly.\" According to Gould \"the ideas came mostly from Niles, with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe. I coined the term \"punctuated equilibrium\" and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould.\" In his book \"Time Frames\" Eldredge recalls that after much discussion the pair \"each wrote roughly half. Some of the parts that would seem obviously the work of one of us were actually first penned by the other—I remember for example, writing the section on Gould's snails. Other parts are harder to reconstruct. Gould edited the entire manuscript for better consistency. We sent it in, and Schopf reacted strongly against it—thus signaling the tenor of the reaction it has engendered, though for shifting reasons, down to the present day.\"\n\nJohn Wilkins and Gareth Nelson have argued that French architect Pierre Trémaux proposed an \"anticipation of the theory of punctuated equilibrium of Gould and Eldredge.\"\n\nThe fossil record includes well documented examples of both phyletic gradualism and punctuational evolution. As such, much debate persists over the prominence of stasis in the fossil record. Before punctuated equilibrium, most evolutionists considered stasis to be rare or unimportant. The paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson, for example, believed that phyletic gradual evolution (called \"horotely\" in his terminology) comprised 90% of evolution. More modern studies, including a meta-analysis examining 58 published studies on speciation patterns in the fossil record showed that 71% of species exhibited stasis, and 63% were associated with punctuated patterns of evolutionary change. According to Michael Benton, \"it seems clear then that stasis is common, and that had not been predicted from modern genetic studies.\" A paramount example of evolutionary stasis is the fern \"Osmunda claytoniana\". Based on paleontological evidence it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years.\n\nWhen Eldredge and Gould published their 1972 paper, allopatric speciation was considered the \"standard\" model of speciation. This model was popularized by Ernst Mayr in his 1954 paper \"Change of genetic environment and evolution,\" and his classic volume \"Animal Species and Evolution\" (1963).\n\nAllopatric speciation suggests that species with large central populations are stabilized by their large volume and the process of gene flow. New and even beneficial mutations are diluted by the population's large size and are unable to reach fixation, due to such factors as constantly changing environments. If this is the case, then the transformation of whole lineages should be rare, as the fossil record indicates. Smaller populations on the other hand, which are isolated from the parental stock, are decoupled from the homogenizing effects of gene flow. In addition, pressure from natural selection is especially intense, as peripheral isolated populations exist at the outer edges of ecological tolerance. If most evolution happens in these rare instances of allopatric speciation then evidence of gradual evolution in the fossil record should be rare. This hypothesis was alluded to by Mayr in the closing paragraph of his 1954 paper:\n\nAlthough punctuated equilibrium generally applies to sexually reproducing organisms, some biologists have applied the model to non-sexual species like viruses, which cannot be stabilized by conventional gene flow. As time went on biologists like Gould moved away from wedding punctuated equilibrium to allopatric speciation, particularly as evidence accumulated in support of other modes of speciation. Gould, for example, was particularly attracted to Douglas Futuyma's work on the importance of reproductive isolating mechanisms.\n\nMany hypotheses have been proposed to explain the putative causes of stasis. Gould was initially attracted to I. Michael Lerner's theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis. However this hypothesis was rejected over time, as evidence accumulated against it. Other plausible mechanisms which have been suggested include: habitat tracking, stabilizing selection, the Stenseth-Maynard Smith stability hypothesis, constraints imposed by the nature of subdivided populations, normalizing clade selection, and koinophilia.\n\nEvidence for the existence of stasis has also been corroborated from the genetics of sibling species, species which are morphologically indistinguishable, but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently to suggest they have been separated for millions of years.\n\nAccording to Gould, \"stasis may emerge as the theory's most important contribution to evolutionary science.\" Philosopher Kim Sterelny in clarifying the meaning of stasis adds, \"In claiming that species typically undergo no further evolutionary change once speciation is complete, they are not claiming that there is no change at all between one generation and the next. Lineages do change. But the change between generations does not accumulate. Instead, over time, the species wobbles about its phenotypic mean. Jonathan Weiner's \"The Beak of the Finch\" describes this very process.\"\n\nPunctuated equilibrium has also been cited as contributing to the hypothesis that species are Darwinian individuals, and not just classes, thereby providing a stronger framework for a hierarchical theory of evolution.\n\nMuch confusion has arisen over what proponents of punctuated equilibrium actually argued, what mechanisms they advocated, how fast the punctuations were, what taxonomic scale their theory applied to, how revolutionary their claims were intended to be, and how punctuated equilibrium related to other ideas like saltationism, quantum evolution, and mass extinction.\n\nThe punctuational nature of punctuated equilibrium has engendered perhaps the most confusion over Eldredge and Gould's theory. Gould's sympathetic treatment of Richard Goldschmidt, the controversial geneticist who advocated the idea of \"hopeful monsters,\" led some biologists to conclude that Gould's punctuations were occurring in single-generation jumps. This interpretation has frequently been used by creationists to characterize the weakness of the paleontological record, and to portray contemporary evolutionary biology as advancing neo-saltationism. In an often quoted remark, Gould stated, \"Since we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists—whether through design or stupidity, I do not know—as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but they are abundant between larger groups.\" Although there exist some debate over how long the punctuations last, supporters of punctuated equilibrium generally place the figure between 50,000 and 100,000 years.\n\nQuantum evolution was a controversial hypothesis advanced by Columbia University paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson, who was regarded by Gould as \"the greatest and most biologically astute paleontologist of the twentieth century.\" Simpson's conjecture was that according to the geological record, on very rare occasions evolution would proceed very rapidly to form entirely new families, orders, and classes of organisms. This hypothesis differs from punctuated equilibrium in several respects. First, punctuated equilibrium was more modest in scope, in that it was addressing evolution specifically at the species level. Simpson's idea was principally concerned with evolution at higher taxonomic groups. Second, Eldredge and Gould relied upon a different mechanism. Where Simpson relied upon a synergistic interaction between genetic drift and a shift in the adaptive fitness landscape, Eldredge and Gould relied upon ordinary speciation, particularly Ernst Mayr's concept of allopatric speciation. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, quantum evolution took no position on the issue of stasis. Although Simpson acknowledged the existence of stasis in what he called the bradytelic mode, he considered it (along with rapid evolution) to be unimportant in the larger scope of evolution. In his \"Major Features of Evolution\" Simpson stated, \"Evolutionary change is so nearly the universal rule that a state of motion is, figuratively, normal in evolving populations. The state of rest, as in bradytely, is the exception and it seems that some restraint or force must be required to maintain it.\" Despite such differences between the two models, earlier critiques—from such eminent commentators as Sewall Wright as well as Simpson himself—have argued that punctuated equilibrium is little more than quantum evolution relabeled.\n\nPunctuated equilibrium is often portrayed to oppose the concept of gradualism, when it is actually a form of gradualism. This is because even though evolutionary change appears instantaneous between geological sedimentary layers, change is still occurring incrementally, with no great change from one generation to the next. To this end, Gould later commented that \"Most of our paleontological colleagues missed this insight because they had not studied evolutionary theory and either did not know about allopatric speciation or had not considered its translation to geological time. Our evolutionary colleagues also failed to grasp the implication(s), primarily because they did not think at geological scales\".\n\nRichard Dawkins dedicated a chapter in \"The Blind Watchmaker\" to correcting, in his view, the wide confusion regarding \"rates of change\". His first point is to argue that phyletic gradualism — understood in the sense that evolution proceeds at a single uniform rate of speed, called \"constant speedism\" by Dawkins — is a \"caricature of Darwinism\" and \"does not really exist\". His second argument, which follows from the first, is that once the caricature of \"constant speedism\" is dismissed, we are left with one logical alternative, which Dawkins terms \"variable speedism\". Variable speedism may also be distinguished one of two ways: \"\"discrete variable\" speedism\" and \"\"continuously variable\" speedism\". Eldredge and Gould, proposing that evolution jumps between stability and relative rapidity, are described as \"discrete variable speedists\", and \"in this respect they are genuinely radical.\" They assert that evolution generally proceeds in bursts, or not at all. \"Continuously variable speedists\", on the other hand, advance that \"evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously from very fast to very slow and stop, with all intermediates. They see no particular reason to emphasize certain speeds more than others. In particular, stasis, to them, is just an extreme case of ultra-slow evolution. To a punctuationist, there is something very special about stasis.\" Dawkins therefore commits himself here to an empirical claim about the geological record, in contrast to his earlier claim that \"The paleontological evidence can be argued about, and I am not qualified to judge it.\" It is this particular commitment that Eldredge and Gould have aimed to overturn.\n\nRichard Dawkins regards the apparent gaps represented in the fossil record to document migratory events rather than evolutionary events. According to Dawkins, evolution certainly occurred but \"probably gradually\" elsewhere. However, the punctuational equilibrium model may still be inferred from both the observation of stasis and examples of rapid and episodic speciation events documented in the fossil record.\n\nDawkins also emphasizes that punctuated equilibrium has been \"oversold by some journalists\", but partly due to Eldredge and Gould's \"later writings\". Dawkins contends that the hypothesis \"does not deserve a particularly large measure of publicity\". It is a \"minor gloss,\" an \"interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory,\" and \"lies firmly within the neo-Darwinian synthesis\".\n\nIn his book \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\", philosopher Daniel Dennett is especially critical of Gould's presentation of punctuated equilibrium. Dennett argues that Gould alternated between revolutionary and conservative claims, and that each time Gould made a revolutionary statement—or appeared to do so—he was criticized, and thus retreated to a traditional neo-Darwinian position. Gould responded to Dennett's claims in \"The New York Review of Books\", and in his technical volume \"The Structure of Evolutionary Theory\".\n\nEnglish professor Heidi Scott argues that Gould's talent for writing vivid prose, his use of metaphor, and his success in building a popular audience of nonspecialist readers altered the \"climate of specialized scientific discourse\" favorably in his promotion of punctuated equilibrium. While Gould is celebrated for the color and energy of his prose, as well as his interdisciplinary knowledge, critics such as Scott, Richard Dawkins, and Daniel Dennett have concerns that the theory has gained undeserved credence among non-scientists because of Gould's rhetorical skills. Philosopher John Lyne and biologist Henry Howe believed punctuated equilibrium's success has much more to do with the nature of the geological record than the nature of Gould's rhetoric. They state, a \"re-analysis of existing fossil data has shown, to the increasing satisfaction of the paleontological community, that Eldredge and Gould were correct in identifying periods of evolutionary stasis which are interrupted by much shorter periods of evolutionary change.\"\n\nSome critics jokingly referred to the theory of punctuated equilibrium as \"evolution by jerks\",\nwhich reportedly prompted punctuationists to describe phyletic gradualism as \"evolution by creeps.\"\n\nThe sudden appearance of most species in the geologic record and the lack of evidence of substantial gradual change in most species—from their initial appearance until their extinction—has , including by Charles Darwin who appealed to the imperfection of the record as the favored explanation. When presenting his ideas against the prevailing influences of catastrophism and progressive creationism, which envisaged species being supernaturally created at intervals, Darwin needed to forcefully stress the gradual nature of evolution in accordance with the gradualism promoted by his friend Charles Lyell. He privately expressed concern, noting in the margin of his 1844 \"Essay\", \"Better begin with this: If species really, after catastrophes, created in showers world over, my theory false.\"\n\nIt is often incorrectly assumed that he insisted that the rate of change must be constant, or nearly so, but even the first edition of \"On the Origin of Species\" states that \"Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms... The Silurian \"Lingula\" differs but little from the living species of this genus\". \"Lingula\" is among the few brachiopods surviving today but also known from fossils over 500 million years old. In the fourth edition (1866) of \"On the Origin of Species\" Darwin wrote that \"the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.\" Thus punctuationism in general is consistent with Darwin's conception of evolution.\n\nAccording to early versions of punctuated equilibrium, \"peripheral isolates\" are considered to be of critical importance for speciation. However, Darwin wrote, \"\"I can by no means agree\" ... that immigration and isolation are necessary elements... Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area is still more important, especially for the production of species which shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely.\"\n\nThe importance of isolation in forming species had played a significant part in Darwin's early thinking, as shown in his \"Essay\" of 1844. But by the time he wrote the \"Origin\" he had downplayed its importance. He explained the reasons for his revised view as follows:\nThroughout a great and open area, not only will there be a greater chance of favourable variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms ... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.\n\nThus punctuated equilibrium is incongruous with some of Darwin's ideas regarding the specific mechanisms of evolution, but generally accords with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.\n\nRecent work in developmental biology has identified dynamical and physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis that may underlie abrupt morphological transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change that have been found in reality to be non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms can be found in the multi-authored volume \"Origination of Organismal Form\" (MIT Press; 2003).\n\nIn linguistics, R. M. W. Dixon has proposed a punctuated equilibrium model for language histories, with reference particularly to the prehistory of the indigenous languages of Australia and his objections to the proposed Pama–Nyungan language family there. Although his model has raised considerable interest, it does not command majority support within linguistics.\n\nSeparately, recent work using computational phylogenetic methods claims to show that punctuational bursts play an important factor when languages split from one another, accounting for anywhere from 10 to 33% of the total divergence in vocabulary.\n\nPunctuational evolution has been argued to explain changes in folktales and mythology over time.\n\n"}

In practice the present may be given before or after the birth, or even in the delivery room. The giving of push presents has supposedly grown in the United States in recent years.\nA \"push gift\" is any type of present loved ones give to a woman who has recently given birth to a child. There is no conclusive evidence that the present was invented by the jewelry industry to sell more goods, and until recently it was passed on largely by word of mouth or peer pressure among both mothers and fathers. According to Linda Murray, the executive editor of BabyCenter, \"It's an expectation of moms these days that they deserve something for bearing the burden for nine months, getting sick, ruining their body. The guilt really gets piled on.\" Other sources trace the development of the present to the increased assertiveness of women, allowing them to ask for a present more directly, or the increased involvement of the men in pregnancy, making them more informed of the pain and difficulty of pregnancy and labor.\n\nA 2004 survey of over 30,000 respondents by BabyCenter found that 38% of new mothers received a push present, and 55% of pregnant mothers wanted one, though fewer thought it was actually expected. About 40% of both groups said the baby itself was already a present and did not wish an additional reward. \n\nThe popularity of push presents has been attributed in part to media coverage of celebrities receiving them. Examples include a 10 carat diamond ring given to celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe by her husband Rodger after the 2011 birth of their son, a Bentley given to reality TV star Peggy Tanous of \"The Real Housewives of Orange County\" by her husband Micah after the 2007 birth of their daughter, and a diamond and sapphire necklace given to singer Mariah Carey by her husband Nick Cannon after the 2011 birth of their twins.\n\nThe trend has generated a backlash, as some couples dislike the implicit materialism of push presents, and would prefer increased help in chores or baby care, or save the money for the child's education.\n\nAccording to etiquette expert Pamela Holland, there are no set guidelines for push presents. \"The standard is that there is no standard,\" she said. \"It does make sense to have etiquette around wedding or baby shower gifts because you're inviting other people into it. But this is far too intimate to have a rule.\" In general it is the woman who lets her man know about push presents, not the other way around, although there can be peer pressure from friends to buy one on either the man or the woman.\n\nAnalysis of conversations on parenting website the BabyCentre's online community over the last three years found that mentions of push presents had increased by 41 per cent in the past 18 months, compared to only a two per cent increase between 2011 and 2012. A poll of 1,200 BabyCentre mothers also revealed that more than a quarter (27 per cent) were expecting, or had already received, a 'push present' this year. Diamonds were the most popular gift in the form of an eternity ring with the prices spent ranging from £500 to £1475. Tablet computers, charm bracelets and designer watches and handbags were also popular gifts to celebrate a new arrival.\n"}

The latter means basic or radical change; whereas reform may be no more than fine tuning, or at most redressing serious wrongs without altering the fundamentals of the system. Reform seeks to improve the system as it stands, never to overthrow it wholesale. Radicals on the other hand, seek to improve the system, but try to overthrow whether it be the government or a group of people themselves.\n\nRotation in office or term limits would, by contrast, be more revolutionary, in altering basic political connections between incumbents and constituents.\n\nDeveloping countries may carry out a wide range of reforms to improve their living standards, often with support from international financial institutions and aid agencies. This can include reforms to macroeconomic policy, the civil service, and public financial management.\n\nReligious Reforms are performed in religions and churches.\n\nA note about spelling: when used to describe something which is \"physically\" formed again, such as re-casting it in a mold/mould, or a band that gets back together, the proper term is \"re-form\" (with a hyphen), not \"reform\".\n\n\n"}

Pali texts employ the Brahmanical motif of a group of three refuges, as found in Rig Veda 9.97.47, Rig Veda 6.46.9 and Chandogya Upanishad 2.22.3-4.\n\nFaith is an important teaching element in both Theravada and Mahayana traditions. In contrast to perceived Western notions of faith, faith in Buddhism arises from accumulated experience and reasoning.\n\nIn the \"Kalama Sutra\", the Buddha explicitly argues against simply following authority or tradition, particularly those of religions contemporary to the Buddha's time. There remains value for a degree of trusting confidence and belief in Buddhism, primarily in the spiritual attainment and salvation or enlightenment. Faith in Buddhism centres on belief in the Three Jewels.\n\nLay followers often undertake five precepts in the same ceremony as they take the refuges. Monks administer the precepts to the laypeople, which creates an additional psychological effect. The five precepts are:\n\n\nIn Early Buddhist Texts, the role of the five precepts gradually developed. First of all, the precepts were combined with a declaration of faith in the triple gem (the Buddha, his teaching and the monastic community). Next, the precepts developed to become the foundation of lay practice. The precepts were seen a preliminary condition for the higher development of the mind. At a third stage in the texts, the precepts were actually mentioned together with the triple gem, as though they were part of it. Lastly, the precepts, together with the triple gem, became a required condition for the practice of Buddhism, as lay people had to undergo a formal initiation to become a member of the Buddhist religion. When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries in which Buddhism was adopted as the main religion without much competition from other religious disciplines, such as Thailand, the relation between the initiation of a lay person and the five precepts has been virtually non-existent, and the taking of the precepts has become a sort of ritual cleansing ceremony. In such countries, people are presumed Buddhist from birth without much of an initiation. The precepts are often committed to by new followers as part of their installment, yet this is not very pronounced. However, in some countries like China, where Buddhism was not the only religion, the precepts became an ordination ceremony to initiate lay people into the Buddhist religion.\n\nA layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a \"jewel among laymen\".\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism there are three refuge formulations, the \"Outer\", \"Inner\", and \"Secret\" forms of the Three Jewels. The 'Outer' form is the 'Triple Gem', (Sanskrit:\"triratna\"), the 'Inner' is the Three Roots and the 'Secret' form is the 'Three Bodies' or trikaya of a Buddha. These alternative refuge formulations are employed by those undertaking Deity Yoga and other tantric practices within the Tibetan Buddhist Vajrayana tradition as a means of recognizing Buddha Nature.\nThree refuge motivation levels are: 1) suffering rebirth's fear motivates with the idea of happiness, 2) knowing rebirth won’t bring freedoms motivated by attaining nirvana, while 3) seeing other’s suffering motivates establishing them all in Buddhahood. Happiness is temporary, lifetimes are impermanent and ultimately refuge is taken until reaching unsurpassed awakening.\n\n\n\n"}

When enabled, the user would have limited access, and commonly still be able to read public discussions; however, any messages posted by that \"twit\" would not be shown to the other users of that group.\n\nMichael Pryor of Fog Creek Software described stealth banning for online forums in 2006, saying how such a system was in place in the project management system FogBugz, \"to solve the problem of how do you get the person to go away and leave you alone\". As well as preventing problem users from engaging in flame wars, the system also discouraged spammers, who if they returned to the site would be under the false impression that their spam was still in place. \"The Verge\" describes it as \"one of the oldest moderation tricks in the book\", noting that early versions of vBulletin had a global ignore list known as \"Tachy goes to Coventry\", as in the British expression \"to send someone to Coventry\", meaning to ignore them and pretend they don't exist.\n\nA 2012 update to Hacker News introduced a system of \"hellbanning\" for spamming and abusive behavior.\n\nCraigslist has also been known to \"ghost\" a user's individual ads, whereby the poster gets a confirmation email and may view the ad in their account, but the ad fails to show up in the appropriate category page.\n\nEarly on, Reddit implemented a similar feature, initially designed to address spam accounts, though it is also used for general users. In 2015, Reddit added an account suspension feature, though the site still makes extensive use of shadow banning. \n\nWeChat was found in 2016 to ban posts and messages that contain certain keywords without notice.\n\nIn a study that looked at tweets from 2014 to early 2015, over a quarter million tweets were found during the one year period in Turkey to have been censored via shadow banning. Twitter was also found, in 2015, to shadowban tweets containing leaked documents in the US.\n\nThe phenomenon was noticed on Instagram in 2017; there, certain posts have been seen to be unavailable to people who do not follow one in hashtag searches.\n\n\"Shadow banning\" became popularized in 2018 as a conspiracy theory that Twitter had shadow-banned Republicans. In late July 2018, \"Vice News\" found that several supporters of the US Republican Party no longer appeared in the auto-populated drop-down search menu on Twitter, thus limiting their visibility when being searched for - allegedly due to the same algorithm that was being used to do the same to the accounts of prominent racists. After that finding, some conservatives accused Twitter of enacting a shadowban on Republican accounts, which Twitter flatly denied. However, some accounts that were not overtly political or conservative apparently had the same algorithm applied to them. In a blog post, Twitter said that the use of the phrase \"shadow banning\" was inaccurate, as the tweets were still visible by navigating to the home page of the relevant account. Later, Twitter restored the affected accounts.\n\n"}
{"id": "25490263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25490263", "title": "Speech repetition", "text": "Speech repetition\n\nSpeech repetition is the saying by one individual of the spoken vocalizations made by another individual. This requires the ability in the person making the copy to map the sensory input they hear from the other person's vocal pronunciation into a similar motor output with their own vocal tract.\n\nSuch speech input output imitation often occurs independently of speech comprehension such as in speech shadowing when a person automatically says words heard in earphones, and the pathological condition of echolalia in which people reflexively repeat overheard words. This links to speech repetition of words being separate in the brain to speech perception. Speech repetition occurs in the dorsal speech processing stream while speech perception occurs in the ventral speech processing stream. Repetitions are often incorporated unawares by this route into spontaneous novel sentences immediately or after delay following storage in phonological memory.\n\nIn humans, the ability to map heard input vocalizations into motor output is highly developed due to this copying ability playing a critical role in a child's rapid expansion of their spoken vocabulary. In older children and adults it still remains important as it enables the continued learning of novel words and names and additional languages. Such repetition is also necessary for the propagation of language from generation to generation. It has also been suggested that the phonetic units out of which speech is made have been selected upon by the process of vocabulary expansion and vocabulary transmissions due to children preferentially copying words in terms of more easily imitated elementary units.\n\nVocal imitation happens quickly: words can be repeated within 250-300 milliseconds both in normals (during speech shadowing) and during echolalia. The imitation of speech syllables possibly happens even quicker: people begin imitating the second phone in the syllable [ao] earlier than they can identify it (out of the set [ao], [aæ] and [ai]). Indeed, \"...simply executing a shift to [o] upon detection of a second vowel in [ao] takes very little longer than does interpreting and executing it as a shadowed response\". Neurobiologically this suggests \"...that the early phases of speech analysis yield information which is directly convertible to information required for speech production\". Vocal repetition can be done immediately as in speech shadowing and echolalia. It can also be done after the pattern of pronunciation is stored in short-term memory or long-term memory. It automatically uses both auditory and where available visual information about how a word is produced.\n\nThe automatic nature of speech repetition was noted by Carl Wernicke, the late nineteenth century neurologist, who observed that \"The primary speech movements, enacted before the development of consciousness, are reflexive and mimicking in nature..\".\n\nVocal imitiation arises in development before speech comprehension and also babbling: 18-week-old infants spontaneously copy vocal expressions provided the accompanying voice matches. Imitation of vowels has been found as young as 12 weeks. It is independent of native language, language skills, word comprehension and a speaker's intelligence. Many autistic and some mentally disabled people engage in the echolalia of overheard words (often their only vocal interaction with others) without understanding what they echo. Reflex uncontrolled echoing of others words and sentences occurs in roughly half of those with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. The ability to repeat words without comprehension also occurs in mixed transcortical aphasia where it links to the sparing of the short-term phonological store.\n\nThe ability to repeat and imitate speech sounds occurs separately to that of normal speech. Speech shadowing provides evidence of a 'privileged' input/output speech loop that is distinct to the other components of the speech system. Neurocognitive research likewise finds evidence of a direct (nonlexical) link between phonological analysis input and motor programming output.\n\nSpeech sounds can be imitatively mapped into vocal articulations in spite of vocal tract anatomy differences in size and shape due to gender, age and individual anatomical variability. Such variability is extensive making input output mapping of speech more complex than a simple mapping of vocal track movements. The shape of the mouth varies widely: dentists recognize three basic shapes of palate: trapezoid, ovoid, and triagonal; six types of malocclusion between the two jaws; nine ways teeth relate to the dental arch and a wide range of maxillary and mandible deformities. Vocal sound can also vary due to dental injury and dental caries. Other factors that do not impede the sensory motor mapping needed for vocal imitation are gross oral deformations such as hare-lips, cleft palates or amputations of the tongue tip, pipe smoking, pencil biting and teeth clinching (such as in ventriloquism). Paranasal sinuses vary between individuals 20-fold in volume, and differ in the presence and the degree of their asymmetry.\n\nVocal imitation occurs potentially in regard to a diverse range of phonetic units and types of vocalization. The world's languages use consonantal phones that differ in thirteen imitable vocal tract place of articulations (from the lips to the glottis). These phones can potentially be pronounced with eleven types of imitable manner of articulations (nasal stops to lateral clicks). Speech can be copied in regard to its social accent, intonation, pitch and individuality (as with entertainment impersonators). Speech can be articulated in ways which diverge considerably in speed, timbre, pitch, loudness and emotion. Speech further exists in different forms such as song, verse, scream and whisper. Intelligible speech can be produced with pragmatic intonation and in regional dialects and foreign accents. These aspects are readily copied: people asked to repeat speech-like words imitate not only phones but also accurately other pronunciation aspects such as fundamental frequency, schwa-syllable expression, voice spectra and lip kinematics, voice onset times, and regional accent.\n\nIn 1874 Carl Wernicke proposed that the ability to imitate speech plays a key role in language acquisition. This is now a widely researched issue in child development. A study of 17,000 one and two word utterances made by six children between 18 months to 25 months found that, depending upon the particular infant, between 5% and 45% of their words might be mimicked. These figures are minima since they concern only immediately heard words. Many words that may seem spontaneous are in fact delayed imitations heard days or weeks previously. At 13 months children who imitate new words (but not ones they already know) show a greater increase in noun vocabulary at four months and non noun vocabulary at eight months. A major predictor of vocabulary increase in both 20 months, 24 months, and older children between 4 and 8 years is their skill in repeating nonword phone sequences (a measure of mimicry and storage). This is also the case with children with Down's syndrome . The effect is larger than even age: in a study of 222 two-year-old children that had spoken vocabularies ranging between 3–601 words the ability to repeat nonwords accounted for 24% of the variance compared to 15% for age and 6% for gender (girls better than boys).\n\nImitation provides the basis for making longer sentences than children could otherwise spontaneously make on their own. Children analyze the linguistic rules, pronunciation patterns, and conversational pragmatics of speech by making monologues (often in crib talk) in which they repeat and manipulate in word play phrases and sentences previously overheard. Many proto-conversations involve children (and parents) repeating what each other has said in order to sustain social and linguistic interaction. It has been suggested that the conversion of speech sound into motor responses helps aid the vocal \"alignment of interactions\" by \"coordinating the rhythm and melody of their speech\". Repetition enables immigrant monolingual children to learn a second language by allowing them to take part in 'conversations'. Imitation related processes aids the storage of overheard words by putting them into speech based short- and long-term memory.\n\nThe ability to repeat nonwords predicts the ability to learn second-language vocabulary. A study found that adult polyglots performed better in short-term memory tasks such as repeating nonword vocalizations compared to nonpolyglots though both are otherwise similar in general intelligence, visuo-spatial short-term memory and paired-associate learning ability. Language delay in contrast links to impairments in vocal imitation.\n\nElectrical brain stimulation research upon the human brain finds that 81% of areas that show disruption of phone identification are also those in which the imitating of oral movements is disrupted and vice versa; Brain injuries in the speech areas show a 0.9 correlation between those causing impairments to the copying of oral movements and those impairing phone production and perception.\n\nSpoken words are sequences of motor movements organized around vocal tract gesture motor targets. Vocalization due to this is copied in terms of the motor goals that organize it rather than the exact movements with which it is produced. These vocal motor goals are auditory. According to James Abbs 'For speech motor actions, the individual articulatory movements would not appear to be controlled with regard to three- dimensional spatial targets, but rather with regard to their contribution to complex vocal tract goals such as resonance properties (e.g., shape, degree of constriction) and or aerodynamically significant variables'. Speech sounds also have duplicable higher-order characteristics such as rates and shape of modulations and rates and shape of frequency shifts. Such complex auditory goals (which often link—though not always—to internal vocal gestures) are detectable from the speech sound which they create.\n\nTwo cortical processing streams exist: a ventral one which maps sound onto meaning, and a dorsal one, that maps sound onto motor representations. The dorsal stream projects from the posterior Sylvian fissure at the temporoparietal junction, onto frontal motor areas, and is not normally involved in speech perception. \nCarl Wernicke identified a pathway between the left posterior superior temporal sulcus (a cerebral cortex region sometimes called the Wernicke's area) as a centre of the sound \"images\" of speech and its syllables that connected through the arcuate fasciculus with part of the inferior frontal gyrus (sometimes called the Broca's area) responsible for their articulation. This pathway is now broadly identified as the dorsal speech pathway, one of the two pathways (together with the ventral pathway) that process speech. The posterior superior temporal gyrus is specialized for the transient representation of the phonetic sequences used for vocal repetition. Part of the auditory cortex also can represent aspects of speech such as its consonantal features.\n\nMirror neurons have been identified that both process the perception and production of motor movements. This is done not in terms of their exact motor performance but an inference of the intended motor goals with which it is organized. Mirror neurons that both perceive and produce the motor movements of speech have been identified. According to the motor theory of speech imitation such speech mirror neurons in infants have selected for motor goals with vocal track gestures that are easy to imitate and this has shaped the nature of the phonetic units out of which spoken words are constructed. Speech is mirrored constantly into its articulations since speakers cannot know in advance that a word is unfamiliar and in need of repetition—which is only learnt after the opportunity to map it into articulations has gone. Thus, speakers if they are to incorporate unfamiliar words into their spoken vocabulary\nmust by default map all spoken input. The motor theory of speech imitation unlike that of motor theory of speech perception does not link mirror neurons with speech perception.\n\nHuman language is a vocabulary-based form of communication that unlike that of other animals employs tens of thousands of lexicals and names. This requires that young humans new to language have the ability to quickly learn both the pronunciations and use of many thousands of words. If children could not repeat speech without problems, human language could not exist. This makes the evolution of the capacity of speech repetition a critical innovation needed for the origin of speech The motor theory of speech imitation argues that this need for speech to be imitable not speech perception nor speech production moreover underlies the evolved nature of the vowel and consonant units of phonetics.\n\nWords in sign languages, unlike those in spoken ones, are made not of sequential units but of spatial configurations of subword unit arrangements, the spatial analogue of the sonic-chronological morphemes of spoken language. These words, like spoken ones, are learnt by imitation. Indeed, rare cases of compulsive sign-language echolalia exist in otherwise language-deficient deaf autistic individuals born into signing families. At least some cortical areas neurobiologically active during both sign and vocal speech, such as the auditory cortex, are associated with the act of imitation.\n\nBirds learn their songs from those made by other birds. In several examples, birds show highly developed repetition abilities: the Sri Lankan Greater racket-tailed drongo (\"Dicrurus paradiseus\") copies the calls of predators and the alarm signals of other birds Albert's lyrebird (\"Menura alberti\") can accurately imitate the satin bowerbird (\"Ptilonorhynchus violaceus\"),\n\nResearch upon avian vocal motor neurons finds that they perceive their song as a series of articulatory gestures as in humans. Birds that can imitate humans, such as the Indian hill myna (Gracula religiosa), imitate human speech by mimicking the various speech formants, created by changing the shape of the human vocal tract, with different vibration frequencies of its internal tympaniform membrane. Indian hill mynahs also imitate such phonetic characteristics as voicing, fundamental frequencies, formant transitions, nasalization, and timing, through their vocal movements are made in a different way from those of the human vocal apparatus.\n\n\nApes taught language show an ability to imitate language signs with chimpanzees such as Washoe who was able to learn with his arms a vocabulary of 250 American Sign Language gestures. However, such human trained apes show no ability to imitate human speech vocalizations.\n\n"}
{"id": "205394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205394", "title": "Task force", "text": "Task force\n\nA task force (TF) is a unit or formation established to work on a single defined task or activity. Originally introduced by the United States Navy, the term has now caught on for general usage and is a standard part of NATO terminology. Many non-military organizations now create \"task forces\" or task groups for temporary activities that might have once been performed by \"ad hoc (designated purpose)\" committees.\n\nThe concept of a naval task force is as old as navies, and prior to that time the assembly of ships for naval operations was referred to as fleets, divisions, or on the smaller scale, squadrons, and flotillas.\n\nBefore World War II ships were collected into divisions derived from the Royal Navy's \"division\" of the line of battle in which one squadron usually remained under the direct command of the Admiral of the Fleet, one squadron was commanded by a Vice Admiral, and one by a Rear Admiral, each of the three squadrons flying different coloured flags, hence the terms flagship and flag officer. The flag of the Fleet Admiral's squadron was red, the Vice Admiral's was white and the Rear Admiral's blue. (The names \"Vice\" (possibly from advanced) and \"Rear\" might have derived from sailing positions within the line at the moment of engagement.) In the late 19th century ships were collected in numbered squadrons, which were assigned to named (such as the Asiatic Fleet) and later numbered fleets.\n\nA task force can be assembled using ships from different divisions and squadrons, without requiring a formal and permanent fleet reorganization, and can be easily dissolved following completion of the operational task. The task force concept worked very well, and by the end of World War II about 100 task forces had been created in the U.S. Navy alone .\n\nIn the United States Navy, task forces are generally temporary organizations composed of particular ships, aircraft, submarines, military land forces, or shore service units, assigned to fulfill certain missions. The emphasis is placed on the individual commander of the unit, and references to \"Commander, Task Force\" (\"CTF\") are common.\n\nIn the U.S. Navy, task forces as part of numbered fleets have been assigned a two-digit number since March 1943, when Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest J. King instituted the system of numbering all fleets, assigning the even numbers to the Atlantic and the odd to the Pacific.\n\nNaval Forces, Europe, became the Twelfth Fleet, South Atlantic Force the Fourth Fleet, and Naval Forces, Northwest African Waters, the Eighth Fleet. The Atlantic Fleet, itself, was designated the Second Fleet. \n\nThe United States Navy has used numbered task forces in the same way since 1945. The U.S. Department of Defense often forms a Joint Task Force if the force includes units from other services. Joint Task Force 1 was the atomic bomb test force during the post-World War II Operation Crossroads.\n\nIn naval terms, the multinational (Australia, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and New Zealand) Combined Communications Electronics Board mandates through Allied Communications Publication 113 (ACP 113) the present system, which allocated numbers from 1 to 834. For example, the Royal Navy's \"Illustrious\" battle group in 2000 for Exercise Linked Seas, subsequently deployed to Operation Palliser, was Task Group 342.1. The French Navy is allocated the series TF 470–474, and Task Force 473 has been used recently for an Enduring Freedom task force deployment built around the French aircraft carrier \"Charles de Gaulle\" (R91). Task Force 142 is the U.S. Navy's Operational Test and Evaluation Force.\n\nThe first digit of a task force designation is that of its parent fleet while the second is sequential. Task groups within a force are numbered by an additional digit separated from the TF number by a decimal point. Task units within a group are indicated by an additional decimal. For example, \"the third task unit of the fifth task group of the second task force of the Sixth Fleet would be numbered 62.5.3.\" This system extends further to task elements, individual ships in a task group. This arrangement was typically abbreviated, so references like TF 11 are commonly seen. There is no requirement for uniqueness over time (e.g., the United States Seventh Fleet used TF 76 in World War II, and off Vietnam, and continued to use TF 70–79 numberings throughout the rest of the twentieth century, and up to 2012).\n\n\nSee Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) for a description of the three standard combined arms task force organizations employed by the USMC.\nEarlier in the Second World War, the British Royal Navy had already devised its own system of \"Forces,\" they mainly assigned a letter occasionally a number some of the task forces are listed below .\n\nLettered Task Forces\n\nOriginally stationed at Malta took part in the Battle of Calabria in 1940 it transferred Trincomalee and was a component of the (fast force) of the Eastern Fleet during the Indian Ocean raid April to May 1942.\nOriginally stationed at Malta, took part in the Battle of Calabria in 9 July 1940, took part in the Battle of Cape Spartivento, 27 November 1940, was involved in the First Battle of Sirte, 17 December 1941 it then moved to Trincomalee in March 1942 was a component (slow force) of the Eastern Fleet during the Indian Ocean raid April to May 1942.\nFormed as part of a number of hunting task groups in 5 October 1939 as a prelude to Battle of the River Plate, 13 December 1939 and part of the South America Division after which it was stationed at, Gibraltar, took part in Operation Catapult, 3 July 1940, took part in Operation Rheinübung 19 May - 15 June 1941. \nPart of a number of hunting task groups in 5 October 1939 as a prelude to Battle of the River Plate, 13 December 1939 based in Freetown it was then stationed at, Malta, took part in the Battle of the Tarigo Convoy, 16 April 1941, was involved in the First Battle of Sirte, 17 December 1941 then moved to Freetown in December 1941.\n\nNumbered Task Forces\n\nFormed to deal with the Tirpitz Sortie against convoys PQ 12 and QP8, 6–13 March 1942.\nFormed 13 May 1945 and took part in the Battle off Penang - the Battle of the Malacca Strait.\nWhich was the composition of the British Pacific Fleet 23 March 1945.\n\n\"Post second world war\"\n\nDuring the Falklands War in 1982 Royal Navy assembled as Task Force 317 to achieve sea and air supremacy in the Total Exclusion Zone, before the amphibious forces arrived.\n\nIn Argentina Navy task force (Grupo de Tareas, Task Force) ran task units that were responsible for thousands of instances of forced disappearance, torture and illegal execution of Argentine civilians, many of whom were incarcerated in the Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy detention center during the 1976–1983 military dictatorship.\n\nDuring the Falklands War in 1982 the Argentine Navy formed three smaller Task Groups called (\"Grupo de Tareas\") for pincer movements against the Royal Navy.\n\nIn the U.S. Army, a task force is a battalion-sized (usually, although there are variations in size) \"ad hoc\" unit formed by attaching smaller elements of other units. A company-sized unit with an armored or mechanized infantry unit attached is called a \"company team\". A similar unit at the brigade level is called a \"brigade combat team\" (BCT), and there is also a similar \"Regimental combat team\" (RCT).\n\nIn the British Army and the armies of other Commonwealth countries, such units are traditionally known as battlegroups.\n\nThe 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) was a brigade-sized formation which commanded Australian and New Zealand Army units deployed to South Vietnam between 1966 and 1972. More recently, Australian task forces have been designated to cover temporary support elements such the battalion-sized force which operated in Urozgan Province, Afghanistan from 2006 to 2013, and the Northern Territory Emergency Response Task Force.\n\nIn government or business a task force is a temporary organization created to solve a particular problem. It is considered to be a more formal \"ad hoc\" committee.\n\nA taskforce, or more-commonly, task force, is a special committee, usually of experts, formed expressly for the purpose of studying a particular problem. The task force usually performs some sort of an audit to assess the current situation, then draws up a list of all the current problems present and evaluates which ones merit fixing and which ones are actually fixable. The task force would then formulate a set of solutions to the problems and pick the \"best\" solution to each problem, as determined by some set of standards. For example, a task force set up to eliminate excessive government spending might consider a \"best\" solution to be one that saves the most money. Normally, the task force then presents its findings and proposed solutions to the institution that called for its formation; it is then up to the institution itself to actually act upon the task force's recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "235032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235032", "title": "Thou", "text": "Thou\n\nThe word thou () is a second person singular pronoun in English. It is now largely archaic, having been replaced in most contexts by \"you\". It is used in parts of Northern England and in Scots (), and also in rural parts of Newfoundland albeit as a recessive feature. \"Thou\" is the nominative form; the oblique/objective form is thee (functioning as both accusative and dative), the possessive is thy (adjective) or thine (adjective before a vowel or pronoun) and the reflexive is thyself. When \"thou\" is the grammatical subject of a finite verb in the indicative mood, the verb form typically ends in \"-(e)st\" (e.g., \"thou goest\"; \"thou do(e)st\"), but in some cases just \"-t\" (e.g., \"thou art\"; \"thou shalt\"), although in some dialects of Old English (mainly in the North), this verb form ended in -s, hence the Quaker habit of using what looks like the third person form of the verb with \"thee\" as the subject (paralleling the usage of \"you\").\n\nOriginally, \"thou\" was simply the singular counterpart to the plural pronoun \"ye\", derived from an ancient Indo-European root. In Middle English, \"thou\" was sometimes abbreviated by putting a small \"u\" over the letter thorn: þͧ. Starting in the 1300s, \"thou\" was used to express intimacy, familiarity or even disrespect, while another pronoun, \"you\", the oblique/objective form of \"ye\", was used for formal circumstances (see T–V distinction). In the 17th century, \"thou\" fell into disuse in the standard language, often regarded as impolite, but persisted, sometimes in an altered form, in regional dialects of England and Scotland, as well as in the language of such religious groups as the Society of Friends. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry.\n\nEarly English translations of the Bible used the familiar singular form of the second person, which mirrors common usage trends in other languages. The familiar and singular form is used when speaking to God in French (in Protestantism both in past and present, in Catholicism since the post-Vatican II reforms), German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Russian, Yiddish, Turkish, Lithuanian, and Scottish Gaelic (all of which maintain the use of an \"informal\" singular form of the second person in modern speech). In addition, the translators of the King James Version of the Bible attempted to maintain the distinction found in Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic and Koine Greek between singular and plural second person pronouns and verb forms, so they used \"thou\", \"thee\", \"thy\", and \"thine\" for singular, and \"ye\", \"you\", \"your\", and \"yours\" for plural.\n\nIn standard modern English, \"thou\" continues to be used in formal religious contexts, in literature that seeks to reproduce archaic language and in certain fixed phrases such as \"fare thee well\". For this reason, many associate the pronoun with solemnity or formality. Many dialects have compensated for the lack of a singular/plural distinction caused by the disappearance of \"thou\" and \"ye\" through the creation of new plural pronouns or pronominals, such as \"yinz\", \"yous\" and \"y'all\" or the colloquial \"you guys\". \"Ye\" remains common in some parts of Ireland but these examples just given vary regionally and are usually restricted to colloquial speech.\n\nBecause \"thou\" has passed out of common use, its traditional forms are often confused by those imitating archaic speech.\n\nThe English personal pronouns have standardized declension according to the following table:\nVerb forms used after \"thou\" generally end in \"-est\" (pronounced or ) or \"-st\" in the indicative mood in both the present and the past tenses. These forms are used for both strong and weak verbs.\n\nTypical examples of the standard present and past tense forms follow. The \"e\" in the ending is optional; early English spelling had not yet been standardized. In verse, the choice about whether to use the \"e\" often depended upon considerations of meter.\n\n\nModal verbs also have \"-(e)st\" added to their forms:\n\nA few verbs have irregular \"thou\" forms:\n\nIn Proto-English, the second-person singular verb inflection was \"-es\". This came down unchanged from Indo-European and can be seen in quite distantly related Indo-European languages: Russian знаешь, \"znayesh\", thou knowest; Latin \"amas\", thou lovest. (This is parallel to the history of the third-person form, in Old English -eþ, Russian, знает, \"znayet\", he knoweth, Latin \"amat\" he loveth.) The anomalous development from -es to modern English -est, which took place separately at around the same time in the closely related German and West Frisian languages, is understood to be caused by an assimilation of the consonant of the pronoun, which often followed the verb. This is most readily observed in German: liebes du → liebstu → liebst du (lovest thou). The three languages belong to the West Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages, of which West Frisian is the closest to English.\nIn Dutch, the equivalent of \"thou\", \"du\", also became archaic and fell out of use and was replaced by the Dutch equivalent of \"you\", \"gij\" (later \"jij\" or \"u\"), just as it has in English, with the place of the informal plural taken by \"jullie\" (\"cf.\" English \"you people, you guys\").\n\nIn the subjunctive and imperative moods, the ending in \"-(e)st\" is dropped (although it is generally retained in \"thou wert\", the second-person singular past subjunctive of the verb \"to be\"). The subjunctive forms are used when a statement is doubtful or contrary to fact; as such, they frequently occur after \"if\" and the poetic \"and\".\n\nIn modern regional English dialects that use \"thou\" or some variant, such as in Yorkshire, it often takes the third person form of the verb \"-s\". This comes from a merging of Early Modern English second person singular ending \"-st\" and third person singular ending \"-s\" into \"-s\" (the latter a southern variation of \"-þ\" (\"-th\")).\n\nThe present indicative form \"art\" (\"þu eart\") goes back to West Saxon Old English (see OED \"s.v. be\" IV.18) and eventually became standard, even in the south (\"e.g.\" in Shakespeare and the Bible). For its influence also from the North, \"cf.\" Icelandic \"þú ert\". For its ultimate origin, see OED \"be\", etymology section i.ε/ζ. The preterite indicative of \"be\" is generally \"thou wast\".\n\n\"Thou\" originates from Old English , and ultimately via Grimm's law from the Proto-Indo-European *\"tu\", with the expected Germanic vowel lengthening in accented monosyllabic words with an open syllable. \"Thou\" is therefore cognate with Icelandic and Old Norse , German and Continental Scandinavian , Latin and all major Romance languages, Irish, Kurdish, Lithuanian and Latvian or , Greek (), Slavic ты / \"ty\" or ти / \"ti\", Armenian (/), Hindi तू (), Bengali: তুই (\"tui\"), Persian () and Sanskrit त्वम् (). A cognate form of this pronoun exists in almost every other Indo-European language.\nThe second person pronouns in Uralic languages such as Finnish and Hungarian are also similar.\n\nIn Old English, \"thou\" was governed by a simple rule: \"thou\" addressed one person, and \"ye\" more than one. Beginning in the 1300's \"thou\" was gradually replaced by the plural \"ye\" as the form of address for a superior person and later for an equal. For a long time, however, \"thou\" remained the most common form for addressing an inferior person.\n\nThe practice of matching singular and plural forms with informal and formal connotations is called the T–V distinction and in English is largely due to the influence of French. This began with the practice of addressing kings and other aristocrats in the plural. Eventually, this was generalized, as in French, to address any social superior or stranger with a plural pronoun, which was felt to be more polite. In French, \"tu\" was eventually considered either intimate or condescending (and to a stranger, potentially insulting), while the plural form \"vous\" was reserved and formal.\n\nFairly suddenly in the 17th century, \"thou\" began to decline in the standard language (that is, particularly in and around London), often regarded as impolite or ambiguous in terms of politeness. It persisted, sometimes in an altered form, particularly in regional dialects of England and Scotland farther from London, as well as in the language of such religious groups as the Society of Friends. Reasons commonly maintained by modern linguists as to the decline of \"thou\" in the 17th century include the increasing identification of \"you\" with \"polite society\" and the uncertainty of using \"thou\" for inferiors versus \"you\" for superiors (with \"you\" being the safer default) amidst the rise of a new middle class.\n\nIn the 18th century, Samuel Johnson, in \"A Grammar of the English Tongue\", wrote: \"in the language of ceremony ... the second person plural is used for the second person singular\", implying that \"thou\" was still in everyday familiar use for the second-person singular, while \"you\" could be used for the same grammatical person, but only for formal contexts. However, Samuel Johnson himself was born and raised not in the south of England, but in the West Midlands (specifically, Lichfield, Staffordshire), where the usage of \"thou\" persists until the present day, see below, so it is not surprising that he would consider it entirely ordinary and describe it as such. By contrast, for most speakers of southern British English, \"thou\" had already fallen out of everyday use, even in familiar speech, by sometime around 1650. \"Thou\" persisted in a number of religious, literary and regional contexts, and those pockets of continued use of the pronoun tended to undermine the obsolescence of the T–V distinction.\n\nOne notable consequence of the decline in use of the second person singular pronouns \"thou\", \"thy\", and \"thee\" is the obfuscation of certain sociocultural elements of Early Modern English texts, such as many character interactions in Shakespeare's plays, which were mostly written from 1589 to 1613. Although Shakespeare is far from consistent in his writings, his characters primarily tend to use \"thou\" (rather than \"you\") when addressing another who is a social subordinate, a close friend, or a hated wrongdoer.\n\nMany European languages contain verbs meaning \"to address with the informal pronoun\", such as German \"duzen\", the Norwegian noun \"dus\" refers to the practice of using this familiar form of address instead of the De/Dem/Deres formal forms in common use, French \"tutoyer\", Spanish \"tutear\", Swedish \"dua\", Dutch \"jijen en jouen\", Russian \"тыкать (tykat')\", Polish \"tykać\", Romanian \"tutui\", Hungarian \"tegezni\" etc. Although uncommon in English, the usage did appear, such as at the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh in 1603, when Sir Edward Coke, prosecuting for the Crown, reportedly sought to insult Raleigh by saying,\n\nhere using \"thou\" as a verb meaning \"to call (someone) \"thou\" or \"thee\"\". Although the practice never took root in Standard English, it occurs in dialectal speech in the north of England. A formerly common refrain in Yorkshire dialect for admonishing children who misused the familiar form was:\n\nAnd similar in Lancashire dialect:\n\nSee further the Wiktionary page on \"thou\" as a verb.\n\nAs William Tyndale translated the Bible into English in the early 16th century, he preserved the singular and plural distinctions that he found in his Hebrew and Greek originals. He used \"thou\" for the singular and \"ye\" for the plural regardless of the relative status of the speaker and the addressee. Tyndale's usage was standard for the period and mirrored that found in the earlier Wycliffe's Bible and the later King James Bible. But as the use of \"thou\" in non-dialect English began to decline in the 18th century, its meaning nonetheless remained familiar from the widespread use of the latter translation.\n\nThe 1662 \"Book of Common Prayer\", which is still the authorized form of worship in the Church of England, also uses the word \"thou\" to refer to the singular second person.\n\nQuakers formerly used \"thee\" as an ordinary pronoun; the stereotype has them saying \"thee\" for both nominative and accusative cases. This was started at the beginning of the Quaker movement by George Fox, who called it \"plain speaking\", as an attempt to preserve the egalitarian familiarity associated with the pronoun. Most Quakers have abandoned this usage. At its beginning, the Quaker movement was particularly strong in the northwestern areas of England and particularly in the north Midlands area. The preservation of \"thee\" in Quaker speech may relate to this history. Modern Quakers who choose to use this manner of \"plain speaking\" often use the \"thee\" form without any corresponding change in verb form, for example, \"is thee\" or \"was thee\".\n\nIn Latter-day Saint prayer tradition, the terms \"thee\" and \"thou\" are always and exclusively used to address God, as a mark of respect.\n\nIn many of the Quranic translations, particularly those compiled by the Ahmadiyya sect in Islam, the terms \"thou\" and \"thee\" are used. One particular example is The Holy Quran - Arabic Text and English translation, translated by Maulvi Sher Ali.\n\nIn the English translations of the scripture of the Bahá'í Faith, the terms \"thou\" and \"thee\" are also used. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the religion in the first half of the 20th century, adopted a style that was somewhat removed from everyday discourse when translating the texts from their original Arabic or Persian to capture some of the poetic and metaphorical nature of the text in the original languages and to convey the idea that the text was to be considered holy.\n\nThe Revised Standard Version of the Bible, which first appeared in 1946, retained the pronoun \"thou\" exclusively to address God, using \"you\" in other places. This was done to preserve the tone, at once intimate and reverent, that would be familiar to those who knew the King James Version and read the Psalms and similar text in devotional use. The New American Standard Bible (1971) made the same decision, but the revision of 1995 (New American Standard Bible, Updated edition) reversed it. Similarly, the 1989 Revised English Bible dropped all forms of \"thou\" that had appeared in the earlier New English Bible (1970). The New Revised Standard Version (1989) omits \"thou\" entirely and claims that it is incongruous and contrary to the original intent of the use of \"thou\" in Bible translation to adopt a distinctive pronoun to address the Deity. When referring to God, \"thou\" is often capitalized for clarity and reverence.\n\nLike his contemporaries William Shakespeare uses \"thou\" both in the intimate, French style sense, and also to emphasize differences of rank, but he is by no means consistent in using the word, and friends and lovers sometimes call each other \"ye\" or \"you\" as often as they call each other \"thou\", sometimes in ways that can be analysed for meaning, but often apparently at random.\n\nFor example, in the following passage from \"Henry IV\", Shakespeare has Falstaff use both forms with Henry. Initially using \"you\" in confusion on waking he then switches to a comfortable and intimate \"thou\".\n\nWhile in \"Hamlet\", Shakespeare uses discordant second person pronouns to express Hamlet's antagonism towards his mother.\n\nExcept where everyday use survives in some regions of England, the air of informal familiarity once suggested by the use of \"thou\" has disappeared; it is used often for the opposite effect with solemn ritual occasions, in readings from the King James Bible, in Shakespeare and in formal literary compositions that intentionally seek to echo these older styles. Since becoming obsolete in most dialects of spoken English, it has nevertheless been used by more recent writers to address exalted beings such as God, a skylark, Achilles, and even \"The Mighty Thor\". In \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Darth Vader addresses the Emperor with the words: \"What is thy bidding, my master?\" In Leonard Cohen's song \"Bird on the Wire\", he promises his beloved that he'll reform, saying \"I will make it all up to thee.\" The Kaiser Chiefs song \"I Predict a Riot\" is mentioned below. In Diana Ross's song \"Upside Down\" (written by Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards) we hear the lyric \"Respectfully I say to thee I'm aware that you're cheatin'.\" These recent uses of the pronoun suggest something far removed from intimate familiarity or condescension, while they could be seen as mirroring the mode of address used with the Deity in the Bible as discussed above; or in the case of \"Upside Down\", may simply allow a catchy rhyme. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry to demonstrate extreme intimacy. \n\nMost modern writers have no experience using \"thou\" in daily speech; they are therefore vulnerable to confusion of the traditional verb forms. The most common mistake in artificially archaic modern writing is the use of the old third person singular ending \"-eth\" with \"thou\", for example \"thou thinketh\". The conversethe use of the second person singular ending \"-est\" for the third person—also occurs (\"So sayest Thor!\"spoken by Thor). This usage often shows up in modern parody and pastiche in an attempt to make speech appear either archaic or formal. The forms \"thou\" and \"thee\" are often transposed.\n\nIn the fictional teenage argot nadsat, invented for Anthony Burgess's novel \"A Clockwork Orange\" (and the film adaptation), Alex and his \"droogs\" regularly use \"thou\", which fits in with their semi-Edwardian clothing. For example, when fighting a rival gang, Alex addresses them thus (note the mixing of \"you\" and \"thou\" for the second person):\n\nSome translators render the T–V distinction in English with \"thou\" and \"you\", particularly in places where \"you\" appears in the place of expected \"thou\", or vice versa. This practice has largely fallen out of use. Ernest Hemingway, in his novel \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", uses the forms \"thou\" and \"you\" in order to reflect the relationships between his Spanish-speaking characters and to better represent in English the Spanish language in which both formal (\"usted\") and familiar (\"tú\") second-person pronouns still exist.\n\nIn reading passages with \"thou\" and \"thee\", many modern readers stress the pronouns and the verb endings. Traditionally, however, the \"e\" in \"-est\" ought to be unstressed, and \"thou\" and \"thee\" should be no more stressed than \"you\".\n\n\"You\" is now the standard English second-person pronoun and encompasses both the singular and plural senses. In some dialects, however, \"thou\" has persisted, and in others thou is retained for poetic and/or literary use. Further, in others the vacuum created by the loss of a distinction has led to the creation of new forms of the second-person plural, such as y'all in the Southern United States. The forms vary across the English-speaking world and between literature and the spoken language.\n\nIn traditional dialects, \"thou\" is used in the counties of Cumberland, Westmorland, Durham, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire and some western parts of Nottinghamshire. Such dialects normally also preserve distinct verb forms for the singular second person, for example \"thee coost\" (standard English: \"you could\", archaic: \"thou couldst\") in northern Staffordshire. The word \"thee\" is used in the East Shropshire dialect which is now largely confined to the Dawley area of Telford and referred to as the Dawley dialect. Throughout rural Yorkshire, the old distinction between nominative and objective is preserved. The possessive is often written as \"thy\" in local dialect writings, but is pronounced as an unstressed \"tha\", and the possessive form of \"tha\" has in modern usage almost exclusively followed other English dialects in becoming \"yours\" or the local word \"your'n\" (from \"your one\"):\n\nThe apparent incongruity between the archaic nominative, objective and genitive forms of this pronoun on the one hand and the modern possessive form on the other may be a signal that the linguistic drift of Yorkshire dialect is causing \"tha\" to fall into disuse; however, a measure of local pride in the dialect may be counteracting this.\n\nSome other variants are specific to certain areas. In Sheffield, the pronunciation of the word was somewhere in between a /d/ and a /th/ sound, with the tongue at the bottom of the mouth; this led to the nickname of the \"dee-dahs\" for people from Sheffield. In Lancashire and West Yorkshire, \"ta\" was used as an unstressed shortening of \"thou\", which can be found in the song \"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\". These variants are no longer in use.\n\nIn rural North Lancashire between Lancaster and the North Yorkshire border 'tha' is preserved in colloquial phrases such as \"What would \"tha\" like for \"thi\" tea?\" (What would you like for your dinner), and appen \"tha\" waint\" (\"perhaps you won't\"happen being the dialect word for perhaps) and \"tha knows\" (you know). This usage in Lancashire is becoming rare, except for elderly and rural speakers.\n\nThe use of the word \"thee\" in the hit song \"I Predict a Riot\" by Leeds band Kaiser Chiefs (\"Watching the people get lairy / is not very pretty, I tell thee\") caused some comment by people who were unaware that the word is still in use in the Yorkshire dialect.\n\nThe use of the phrase \"tha knows\" has been widely used in various songs by Arctic Monkeys, a popular band from High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. Alex Turner, the band's lead singer, has also often replaced words with \"tha knows\" during live versions of the songs. His election to sing in his native Sheffield accent and their overall revival of the dialect has been met with positive feedback and critical acclaim.\n\nThe use persists somewhat in the West Country dialects, albeit somewhat affected. Some of the Wurzels songs include \"Drink Up Thy Zider\" and \"Sniff Up Thy Snuff\".\n\n\"Thoo\" has also been used in the Orcadian Scots dialect in place of the singular informal \"thou\". In Shetlandic, the other form of Insular Scots, \"du\" and \"de\" are used. The word \"thou\" has been reported in the North Northern Scots dialect of Cromarty as being in common use in the first half of the 20th century and now only in occasional use.\n\nThe word \"thou\" can occasionally be heard in films recorded in certain English dialect. In Ken Loach's films \"Kes\", \"The Price of Coal\" and \"Looks and Smiles\", the word is used frequently in the dialogue. It is used occasionally, but much less frequently, in the 1963 film \"This Sporting Life\".\n\nIn the 2018 film \"Peterloo\", the word is used by many of the working-class characters in Lancashire, including Samuel Bamford.\n\nAll forms of \"thou\" appear in ingame dialogues of the \"Souls video game series\" by FromSoftware. The games are settled in late medieval dark fantasy worlds. An earlier example is the original Dragon Quest for the Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31793449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31793449", "title": "Transition management (governance)", "text": "Transition management (governance)\n\nTransition management is a governance approach that aims to facilitate and accelerate sustainability transitions through a participatory process of visioning, learning and experimenting. In its application, transition management seeks to bring together multiple viewpoints and multiple approaches in a 'transition arena'. Participants are invited to structure their shared problems with the current system and develop shared visions and goals which are then tested for practicality through the use of experimentation, learning and reflexivity. The model is often discussed in reference to sustainable development and the possible use of the model as a method for change.\n\nKey principles to transition management as a form of governance:\n\n\nThere have been numerous societal transitions in the past, studied examples include the transition from horse-drawn carriage to motorised cars and the change from physical telegraphy to the electric telephone. There are a number of theories that muse over how transition management evolved into being. One school of thought identifies the sociological aspect of transition as deeply rooted within population dynamics and the evolution of society from high birth rate/high death rate to low birth rate/low death rate. Other theorists consider that transition management has its basis within systems theory and the co-evolution of social and technical factors within the system. Most agree that the shift in the political landscape, from a centralised government to a more liberal, market-based structure has allowed new forms of bottom-up governance styles to rise to prominence and a break from dominant approaches. The most notable use of Transition Management can be established through its development into a practical tool by the Dutch Government to manage the radical transformation of their energy systems in the early 2000s. It was introduced into national policy in the Netherlands in the fourth National Environmental Policy Plan based on a report by Jan Rotmans, Rene Kemp, Frank Geels, Geert Verbong and Marjolein van Asselt.\n\nTransition management is an approach for tackling the complex issue of sustainable development. Sustainable development in itself is a dynamic, multi-dimensional, multi-actor and multi-level problem that is in a constant state of flux. Critics consider that the current political system is insufficiently equipped to deal with the complexity of the issue and that incremental changes will not address the fundamental system failures that underpin the issue. As an alternative to traditional politics, Transition Management will seek to steer development in a more sustainable direction by identifying and fundamentally restructuring the unsustainable systems that underpin our society. The goal of transition management is geared towards enabling, facilitating and guiding the social, technical and political transformations required by embedded societal systems to bring about sustainability. The need for such a model of governance has arisen through the persistence of problems which have developed to span multi-actors, multi-levels and multi-domains. The inherent complexity of society (from the difference of perspectives, norms and values) added to the intricacy of modern-day issues requires a new form of governance. Therefore, transition management recognises the need to address this problem on the multiple levels and dimensions in which it manifests. The approach seeks to widen participation by encouraging bottom-up approaches that are supported in a top-down manner. The synergy gained from utilising transition management to provide a novel approach to the complex issue of Sustainable Development could be essential if progress is to be made on the issue.\n\nUnlike traditional forms of regulation that use command and control techniques, transition management does not seek to control the uncertainties of change but steer, indirectly influence and redirect the choices of actors towards sustainability. In the long-term, transition management will seek to completely transform the system through the process of creative destruction, much of the literature considers that only the radical rebuilding of our society's systems will be able to transcend the stable lock-in to unsustainable systems which has been systematically reinforced by aspects of the landscape and regime levels.\nMost literature recognises that there are three separate levels that transition management must work within; Landscape, Regime and Niche:.\n\n\nThese processes occur within the wider political, cultural and economic background termed the socio-technical landscape. The landscape is an external backdrop to the interplay of actors at the regime and niche level. Changes can occur in the landscape but much more slowly than regime level. One such change is the increase in environmental awareness. This socio-cultural process is leading to pressure on numerous regimes (aviation, agriculture etc.) whilst providing openings for new technologies to establish themselves.\n\n\nTechnological regimes are defined as a set of rules embedded in an engineering community's institutions and infrastructure which shape technological innovations. Geels expanded the focus from engineers to include a wider of range of social groups such as policy makers, financiers and suppliers. This web of inter-linking actors, following a set of rules was termed 'socio-technical regime', in effect, the established practices of a given system. Drawing on evolutionary economics; socio-technical regimes act as a selection and retention mechanism, filtering out the unsuccessful while incorporating more worthy innovations into the existing regime. The regime sits at the meso-level, sandwiched between the micro-level of the niche and the macro-level of the landscape. Change occurs at the regime level incrementally and is geared to achieving optimization. Radical change is potentially threatening to the vested interests of the established regime. The inertia of key industries is seen as an explanation of the difficulties in achieving transitions to sustainability.\n\n\nRadical innovations occur in niches, which act as safe environments in which breakthrough developments can grow, sheltered from the selection process that occurs at regime level. A regime may host a range of niches which generate innovations to challenge the status-quo. The military is seen as a primary niche for major technologies of the last century, supporting the development of radio, aircraft, computers and the internet. The framework of support provided can be financial (most early ventures being commercially unviable); establishing learning processes and facilitating the social networks that lead to growth.\n\nMulti-level Perspective\nGeels presents the interplay between regime, niche and landscape concepts as a multi-level perspective depicting technological transitions. The model is heuristic rather than ontological, and is an aid to better understand the process.\n\nFigure 1: A Dynamic multi-level perspective on Technological transition at: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/content_images/fig/0420240602001.png\nGeels and Schot: 2007\n\nOngoing processes at the regime and landscape level present 'windows of opportunity' for new technologies to exploit and become established. These breakthroughs tend to occur gradually through niche-accumulation. As innovations are used in multiple applications they build until achieving a critical mass. The model proposed by Geels shows how the success of a new technology requires developments across all levels to support the processes occurring within the niche (figure 1). Such an alignment is the basis of a regime shift.\n\nEach level has its own set of actors that interact in different ways, broadly they can be defined into the following categories:\n\n\nPower within the transition process is distributed rather than being top-down in nature; every actor plays a part in shaping the transition. This distributed power enables the process of mutual adaptation towards collective goals and the emergence of self-organised socio-technical 'trajectories'. However, power is not necessarily evenly distributed; relationships and the power of actors within any system are always mixed which gives rise to different forms of interaction and transition. Transition management seeks to exploit this opportunity by involving a wide selection of participants within the process. There are also a number of other important reasons for widening the participation of actors within governance. Firstly, most actors will have different preferences, a small group of actors, even if representative, will fail to identify one vision that will be accepted by everybody. By engaging all actors a plurality of visions that share common factors can be established and provide the basis for the next step. Furthermore, the use of widened participation is likely to attract stronger support and therefore less resistance to the transition. In order to fully transform the landscape level, the underpinning socio-political values and beliefs will also need to be radically rewritten, without the full involvement of society, this may be susceptible to failure. Finally it has also been considered that the heterogeneity of society allows for collective learning which spurs the development of innovations through exploration at the niche level.\n\nKemp \"et al.\" put forward a framework for identifying the different type of activities of which transition management attempts to align. These activities are broadly divided into, strategic, tactical and operational and each activity has its own actors, agendas and strategies which co-evolve.\n\nStrategic activities encompass the process of vision development; the collective action of goal and norm setting through discussion and the formulation of long-term goals. Strategic activities will lead to changes in the 'culture' of the societal system at the landscape level. The focus of this activity is long-term in scale (30 years/generations) and directed towards transition at the landscape level and the system as a whole.\n\nTactical activities relate to the interaction between actors that steers development of both institutions in the landscape level and socio-technical structures (practices, regulations, technology) at the regime level. Tactical activities focus on interpreting the visions created by strategic activities into the regime level and into the various networks, organisations and institutions involved. Tactical activities will also seek to identify the barriers that may be encountered (such as regulation, economic conditions) when interpreting these visions into the regime level. At this stage, actors that have the ability to make changes are recruited to translate the transition vision into their own agendas.\n\nFinally the operational activities constitute the process of learning by doing through experimentation and implementation at the niche level. It has a much short time span of 0–5 years and is focused on the radical innovation that will transform \"societal, technological, institutional, and behavioural practices\" that will in turn filter up and transform structures, culture and routines in the regime and landscape levels (Ibid).\n\nA further activity can be considered which establishes the process of assessment and evaluation of societal change. One can observe that reflexive activities can be both embedded within policy and regulation but also as a function of society and the evaluation of policies through the media and internet (ibid).\n\nThere are number of key aspects that differentiate transition management from other forms of governance, these differences are most apparent due to the model's prescriptive nature. With the concept still being quite fresh and only a handful of case studies to draw from the methodology is still under debate. However, most literature (See References - Loorbach 2007, Kemp, Meadowcroft 2009, Kemp and Loorbach 2003, Foxon \"et al.\" 2009) constitutes the following methodology:\n\nA problem becomes apparent to actors throughout the levels and domains; the first step involves defining the key parameters of the problem then characterising the existing regime and landscape pressures. Differences in interpretation, perceived pressures, opinions and preference ensues the construction of a plurality of visions and solutions for consideration. A 'basket of objectives' is created which express the shared visions and goals of the actors. The visions outlined are long term in nature most commonly spanning at least one generation if not more and are used to inform short-term objectives. These visions can be expressed in a number of ways; more common forms include the use of pathways, scenarios and blueprints. As an example, if the problem of the unsustainable nature of our oil-dependent nation is presented, visions that may be put forward that constitute a carbon-neutral future include; the hydrogen economy, the all-electric society and the transition to global energy infrastructure to facilitate the maximisation of renewable energy.\nAlthough each vision will require different socio-technical changes they will all seek to broadly ensure the same goals are met, for example a low or no carbon economy and a secure and reliable supply.\n\nOnce the pathways have been created short-term 'interim' objectives can be formed through Backcasting (as illustrated by the purple lines in the diagram) and actors within the niche level have the opportunity to form innovative solutions to the problem that may contribute to one of more of the pathways. Transition management will seek to identify those niches that will likely destabilise the regime level and contribute the most to its transformation. Once identified these niche opportunities can be supported by regime changes such as new policy implementation that provide new funding opportunities. In addition to deliberative steering of such choices, pressure can also filter down from the landscape level in the form of market forces which may also steer transition. Experiments within the niche level form a series of 'development rounds' which provide information to decision makers regarding the viability of different options. The information provided by the development rounds is evaluated and if the options are considered to be viable the solution is rolled out primarily on a small scale. Evaluative information can also be used to inform the overall vision created (as illustrated in red in the diagram). Eventually the development of options snowball down a particular pathway and a full system transition takes place. Not all development and transition time-scales are consistent within and between the different levels, actors and domains; some change much more quickly than others. In particular, the landscape level is much slower to change than the regime or niche levels; this has led to the concept being labelled as chaotic and non-linear in nature.\n\nAlthough being less apparent than the Dutch energy transformation, it appears that there is an increasing pressure for theorists to establish frameworks to guide a similar transition within the UK. The UK energy sector is an example of a socio-technical subsystem that exhibits strong lock-in, socially, politically and technically. The technical domain exhibits a strongly centralised infrastructure facilitated by a distribution network, socially speaking the UK energy system is heavily relied upon to provide welfare and enable economic activity. A number of landscape and regime pressures have emerged which impact on the system, primarily related to security of supply and the issue of climate change. The system has also come under pressure from the landscape level in the form of volatile market prices and the impact of the credit crunch. Meanwhile, development at the niche level has continued to build significant levels of alternative technologies and system possibilities through innovation such as offshore wind, wave and tidal power.\n\nAt the regime level, institutions such as the European Investment Bank are beginning to provide funding to facilitate the resources required to advance such niche technology. Furthermore, policies such as that of the Renewables Obligation channels funding from the energy industry to support the niche space and development. As per the method, a number of visions are currently being explored, including smart infrastructure, renewable energy alternatives and the viability of hydrogen. The UK Government uses the Renewable Obligation to 'steer' innovators towards particular solutions. More Renewable Obligation Certificates are awarded to those technologies that are pre-demonstration such as tidal and wave power, while developed technologies such as onshore wind receive less.\n\nHowever, although there are a number of indicators that suggest the transition management model of governance could emerge within the sector, (including in-depth literature outlining the methodology and possible pathways) the UK Government's current pathway (embodied in the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan) does not appear to embody the radical transformation required by transition management. Instead of seeking radical socio-technical transformation, the plan seeks to incrementally improve the system by seeking behavioural changes such as energy efficiency and technical changes by enhancing the contribution of renewables. Without radical infrastructure change the UK risks locking-out a number of promising possible alternatives and may significantly increase the cost of transformation in the future when the need for fundamental systems change becomes more apparent as the current system becomes less able to meet demand.\n\n"}

All the tail feathers except the two central ones have white spots. The wings are black except for a small white patch. The underparts are whitish, sometimes washed with buff. It could be confused with the southern fiscal, but its colouration is distinctly darker and it occurs at higher elevations.\n\nLittle is known of the habits and ecology of this species, but they are likely to be similar to those of the southern fiscal. It seems to be a shy and rather quiet bird.\n\nThe Uhehe fiscal is found only in southern and eastern Tanzania at elevations of above , from Mpwapwa and the Ukaguru Mountains to Njombe, Mount Rungwe and Tukuyu. Its typical habitat is scrubland.\n\nThe Uhehe fiscal has a total population of fewer than 10,000 breeding pairs and a restricted range, but there is no evidence of any substantial decline in numbers of birds, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \"least concern\".\n"}

The procedure involves recording the participants’ interaction with another person and then asking them to review the video while providing feedback about their own interactions, behaviors, and experiences. Subjective understanding includes an individual’s affective and cognitive understandings of an interpersonal event. Often the participants’ ratings are contrasted with the ratings of trained coders and researchers who also observe the video.\n\nVideo recall was first used in research studies over forty years ago. However, the procedure has only been widely used for the past twenty years due to significant advances in technology. Twenty years ago, analog videotape players were a big advancement in technology, allowing for video recall to become more popular. Even though they were better than the previous technology used, they had many disadvantages. Analog videotape players required a large amount of equipment, significant training, large amounts of space for storage, were slow, and were prone to malfunction. With the movement towards digital technology, these disadvantages soon disappeared, causing video recall techniques to be much more appealing to researchers and clinicians. Furthermore, changes in psychological theory have led to the increased use of video recall. For example, family psychologists now place an increased value on individuals’ meanings and emotional perspectives, causing video recall to be an extremely useful procedure.\n\nAll video-recall studies involve recording participants' conversations in either a clinical or research setting, and having the participant or participants review the footage in any number of ways. There are three primary types of video-recall procedures that vary in multiple ways. Different methods are better suited for different research questions, and a combination of the three types may be used.\n\nContinuous video-recall procedures provide consistent, quantifiable data and are often used in marital studies. In this type of study, participants review video footage and rate their conversations on a single affective dimension. This may be done with a computerized joystick or a rating dial and it allows for continuous feedback. This method provides a very brief segment length (often 10 seconds), and thus gives precise analyses of interactions within a conversation. While this method only allows participants to evaluate one dimension of affect, it takes the least time of the three methods because it does not require the footage to be repeatedly paused.\n\nWhen semistructured video-recall procedures are used, the footage is paused at short intervals (typically every 20–30 seconds) during which time participants vocalize what they were thinking or feeling during the segment. These narrations are often recorded for later reference. An alternative method involves allowing the participant to pause the recording and reflect whenever they have input instead of at standardized intervals. Semistructured procedures allow for more in-depth analysis of affect, but do not translate well for data analysis. They are, however, more useful in a clinical context than the other two procedures.\n\nCode-specific video-recall procedures provide quantifiable data on multiple affective measures. Video footage is paused at set intervals (typically 15–30 seconds), at which time participants rate the interactions of themselves as well as their partners on a series of dimensions that are relevant to the research question at hand. This method allows for subjective measurement of many different perceived factors as well as examination of both oneself as well as one's partner or family members. However, code-specific procedures take more time than the other methods, as the video must be repeatedly paused for substantial periods of time.\n\nVideo recall is used in a variety of psychological settings. No one procedure is universally appropriate or applicable, so it is important to match specific techniques to specific cases.\n\nVideo recall is commonly used in psychotherapy for both counseling and instruction. A therapist will record an interview or conversation with a patient, and play it back to them through different procedural means. Sometimes the patient will narrate their inner thoughts or attribution, while other times they will fill out surveys or answer questions at different intervals. A metanalysis of clinical technique of video recall suggested that this method is most effective for families with small children; parents learn successful rearing styles from their own mistakes caught on film. This analysis also suggested that video recall is more successful with skill-learning and instruction than coping mechanisms. However, a successful use of video recall in a therapeutic session is the recording of a conversation between two family members or friends; both will measure their responses while watching, and comparing answers can yield successful results.\n\nVideo recall is also a tool that therapists use to understand their patients. The therapist will record a typical conversation either in the patient's day to day encounters or between the patient and the therapist, and the patient will narrate their understanding of the situation. This is a tool used to overcome cultural barriers.\n\nObservational and interventional methods of video recall are most often used in experimental measures of attribution, emotion and social interaction. Video recall is extremely useful because it can measure patterns in both everyday situations and experimental settings in a less intrusive way than a round table discussion. Video recall can be useful in both group and individual settings.Recall can also measure changes between gender, age, and other demographic factors, as it allows for specific time-stamping: it contains both quick reactions and long-term feelings. In Welsh's 2005 study of different techniques of video recall, he cites \"social constructionism, attachment theory, cognitive–behavioral theories, and symbolic interactionism as theories that are commonly measured through video recall. Much can be inferred from the relationship between cognitive processes and actual events, as it allows for more personalized coding and measurement.\n\nValidity is an important aspect of video recall. It is crucial that the researcher provides clear instruction about what specific parts of the video the subject should measure. For example, if a researcher is studying attribution, they should make clear whether the subject should measure their feelings in the past or present, which perspective they should take, and when to measure certain parts. Delay can be an issue in continuous settings, as subjects may react at different times due to a number of factors. However, Gottman's 1985 study on the use of continuous technique suggested that delay may not change overall effects.\n\nA way to ensure validity is to utilize inter and intra-rater reliability methods, including time-series analysis. This involves the use of multiple methods at a time. A commonly used method that works alongside video recall is various physiological measures, like heart rate, pulese, cortisol sampling, ACT and skin conductance This ensures that rating is consistent.\n"}

It was introduced by an anonymous Iranian, and the practice quickly spread throughout the country. The motto of the movement are two sentences which appear on the walls: \"leave if you do not need\" () and \"take [it] if you need\" ().\n\nInitially started for the homeless people of the Mashhad, Iran, the act serves a purpose to support the people in need. In response to social media, large numbers of people are taking part as a campaign and it has helped many homeless or otherwise destitute people during the cold winter weather.\nA similar initiative, but with open fridges, spread from Tehran to other cities. Bookshelves are also being added to the Walls of Kindness in order to donate books specially for poor children\n\nA wall of kindness was seen in Pakistan's Karachi on 15 January 2016 and another one in China's Liuzhou, located in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on 29 January 2016. Also students of Marymount International School of Rome, in April 2016, have reproduced the idea by designating a wall with similar function and name. A wall of kindness was set up in Peshawar by Serve Mankind & Wadaan and afterwards it started Spreading all over Pakistan such as, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Sialkot, Quetta, Khuzdar and Karachi have witnessed similar walls where people are leaving clothes and other essential items for the poor.\nA new Wall of Kindness was recently witnessed in Amman/Jordan at the Landmark Amman Hotel on November 21st, 2017, which marked the first day of rain, inviting generous souls including children to donate clothes anonymously for the most in need ahead of the winter season. After donations are received, the laundry team at the hotel picks up the clothes, cleans them, irons them, wraps them up and hangs them back so they are available for the recipients, just like brand new items. @landmarkAmman\n\nSimilar walls known as \"Neki ki Deewar\" have sprung up in multiple cities across India such as Allahabad, Bhilwara, Jhalawar, Mysore, Chandigrah, Bhopal, Dehradun, Korba and Kolkata sometimes even having more supply than demand of clothes. The walls are also serving unexpected purpose of keeping walls clean and free from spitting. \n\nThe economy of Iran was hit when sanctions were imposed by the Western World. As the situation became worse, with an increasing number of unemployed, many could not afford clothes. Inflation caused particular difficulties for those in need. In the winter of 2015, young Iranians in Sajjad Boulevard in Mashhad came up with the idea. The main theme was to meet the demand for resources from charities. For the first time, a wall symbolizes unity rather than separation and the community has been asked to donate voluntarily. As soon as the attempt came to the attention of various social and mass media platforms, it was supported and praised by citizens as well as netizens.\n\nYoung Iranians took the chance to strengthen the bonds of community. The campaign went smoothly despite the risk of misuse and loss of resources. People were responsive and well aware of the fact that most vulnerable should get priority.\nWinter clothing disbursed among mass number of people as a welfare had been seen before, but still, the idea was innovative and showed much intelligence.\n\nThe sharing works of charity had a great impacts of religious point of view regarding Islamic country like Iran. Like in other religions, charitable work is considered a virtue in Islam, which has driven people to do more for humanity. Like in Iran, people in Pakistan are showing their humanity via this initiative.\n\n\nhttp://jordanembassyus.org/news/citizens-donate-clothes-anonymously-through-wall-kindness\n\nhttps://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&ccid=lOp744qA&id=2160D27FAA4F97074B88646C0D85A39C72A8606F&thid=OIP.lOp744qAaA7m5RKkxIWDiAHaEc&q=the+wall+of+kindness+amman&simid=608033290988096906&selectedIndex=0&ajaxhist=0\n"}
{"id": "803763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=803763", "title": "Ātman (Buddhism)", "text": "Ātman (Buddhism)\n\nĀtman (), attā or attan in Buddhism is the concept of self, and is found in Buddhist literature's discussion of the concept of non-self (\"Anatta\"). \n\nMost Buddhist traditions and texts reject the premise of a permanent, unchanging \"atman\" (self, soul). However, some Buddhist schools, sutras and tantras present the notion of an \"atman\" or permanent \"Self\", although mostly referring to an Absolute and not to a personal self.\n\nCognates () \"ātman\", (Pāli) \"atta\", Old English \"æthm\", German \"Atem\", and Greek \"atmo\"- derive from the Indo-European root *ēt-men (breath). The word means \"essence, breath, soul.\"\n\n\"Ātman\" and \"atta\" refer to a person's \"true self\", a person's permanent self, absolute within, the \"thinker of thoughts, feeler of sensations\" separate from and beyond the changing phenomenal world. The term \"Ātman\" is synonymous with \"Tuma\", \"Atuma\" and \"Attan\" in early Buddhist literature, state Rhys David and William Stede, all in the sense of \"self, soul\". The \"Atman\" and \"Atta\" are related, in Buddhist canons, to terms such as \"Niratta\" (Nir+attan, soulless) and \"Attaniya\" (belonging to the soul, having a soul, of the nature of soul).\n\n\"Atman\" in early Buddhism appears as \"all \"dhammas\" are not-Self (an-atta)\", where \"atta\" (\"atman\") refers to a metaphysical Self, states Peter Harvey, that is a \"permanent, substantial, autonomous self or I\". This concept refers to the pre-Buddhist Upanishads of Hinduism, where a person is viewed as having a lower self (impermanent body, personality) and a Higher or Greater Self (real permanent Self, soul, atman, atta). The early Buddhist literature explores the validity of the Upanishadic concepts of self and Self, then asserts that every living being has an impermanent self but there is no real Higher Self. The Nikaya texts of Buddhism deny that there is anything called Ātman that is the substantial absolute or essence of a living being, an idea that distinguishes Buddhism from the Brahmanical (proto-Hindu) traditions.\n\nThe Buddha argued that no permanent, unchanging \"self\" can be found. In Buddha's view, states Wayman, \"\"eso me atta\", or this is my self, is to be in the grip of wrong view\". All conditioned phenomena are subject to change, and therefore can't be taken to be an unchanging \"self\". Instead, the Buddha explains the perceived continuity of the human personality by describing it as composed of five skandhas, without a permanent entity (Self, soul).\n\nOf the early Indian Buddhist schools, only the Pudgalavada-school diverged from this basic teaching. The Pudgalavādins asserted that, while there is no ātman, there is a pudgala or \"person\", which is neither the same as nor different from the skandhas.\n\n\"Buddha-nature\" is a central notion of east-Asian (Chinese) Mahayana thought. It refers to several related terms, most notably \"Tathāgatagarbha\" and \"Buddha-dhātu\". \"Tathāgatagarbha\" means \"the womb of the thus-gone\" (c.f. enlightened one), while \"Buddha-dhātu\" literally means \"Buddha-realm\" or \"Buddha-substrate\". Several key texts refer to the \"tathāgatagarbha\" or \"Buddha-dhātu\" as \"atman\", self or essence, though those texts also contain warnings against a literal interpretation. Several scholars have noted similarities between \"tathāgatagarbha\" texts and the substantial monism found in the atman/Brahman tradition.\n\nThe \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrine, at its earliest, probably appeared about the later part of the 3rd century CE, and is verifiable in Chinese translations of 1st millennium CE.\n\nIn contrast to the madhyamika-tradition, the \"Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" uses \"positive language\" to denote \"absolute reality\". According to Paul Williams, the \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" teaches an underlying essence, \"Self\", or \"atman\". This \"true Self\" is the Buddha-nature (\"Tathagatagarbha\"), which is present in all sentient beings, and realized by the awakened ones. Most scholars consider the \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrine in \"Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" asserting an 'essential nature' in every living being is equivalent to 'Self', and it contradicts the Anatta doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the \"Tathagatagarbha Sutras\" were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.\n\nAccording to Sallie B. King, the \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" does not represent a major innovation. Its most important innovation is the linking of the term \"buddhadhatu\" with \"tathagatagarbha\". According to King, the sutra is rather unsystematic, which made it \"a fruitful one for later students and commentators, who were obliged to create their own order and bring it to the text\". The sutra speaks about Buddha-nature in so many different ways, that Chinese scholars created a list of types of Buddha-nature that could be found in the text. One of those statements is:\nIn the \"Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" the Buddha also speaks of the \"affirmative attributes\" of nirvana, \"the Eternal, Bliss, the Self and the Pure.\" The \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" explains:\nEdward Conze connotatively links the term \"tathagata\" itself (the designation which the Buddha applied to himself) with the notion of a real, true self:\nIt is possible, states Johannes Bronkhorst, that \"original Buddhism did not deny the existence of the soul [Ātman, Attan]\", even though a firm Buddhist tradition has maintained that the Buddha avoided talking about the soul or even denied it existence. While there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, adds Bronkhorst, it is clear from these texts that seeking self-knowledge is not the Buddhist path for liberation, and turning away from self-knowledge is. This is a reverse position to the Vedic traditions which recognized the knowledge of the self as \"the principal means to achieving liberation\".\n\nAccording to Paul Wiliams, the \"Mahaparinirvana Sutra\" uses the term \"Self\" in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics. He quotes from the sutra:\nIn the later \"Lankāvatāra Sūtra\" it is said that the \"tathāgatagarbha\" might be mistaken for a self, which it is not.\n\nThe \"Ratnagotravibhāga\" (also known as \"Uttaratantra\"), another text composed in the first half of 1st millennium CE and translated into Chinese in 511 CE, points out that the teaching of the \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrine is intended to win sentient beings over to abandoning \"self-love\" (\"atma-sneha\") – considered to be one of the defects by Buddhism. The 6th-century Chinese \"Tathagatagarbha\" translation states that \"Buddha has \"shiwo\" (True Self) which is beyond being and nonbeing\". However, the \"Ratnagotravibhāga\" asserts that the \"Self\" implied in \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrine is actually \"not-Self\".\n\nThe dispute about \"self\" and \"not-self\" doctrines has continued throughout the history of Buddhism. In Thai Theravada Buddhism, for example, states Paul Williams, some modern-era Buddhist scholars have claimed that \"nirvana is indeed the true Self\", while other Thai Buddhists disagree.\n\nFor instance, the Dhammakaya Movement in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of \"anatta\" (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the \"true self\" or \"dhammakaya\". The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is atta, or true self, was criticized as heretical in Buddhism in 1994 by Ven. Payutto, a well-known scholar monk, who stated that 'Buddha taught nibbana as being non-self\". The abbot of one major temple in the Dhammakaya Movement, Luang Por Sermchai of Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram, argues that it tends to be scholars who hold the view of absolute non-self, rather than Buddhist meditation practitioners. He points to the experiences of prominent forest hermit monks to support the notion of a \"true self\". Similar interpretations on the \"true self\" were put forth earlier by the 12th Supreme Patriarch of Thailand in 1939. According to Williams, the Supreme Patriarch's interpretation echoes the \"tathāgatagarbha\" sutras.\n\nSeveral notable teachers of the Thai Forest Tradition have also described ideas in contrast to absolute non-self. Ajahn Maha Bua, a well known meditation master, described the citta (mind) as being an indestructible reality that does not fall under \"anattā.\" He has stated that not-self is merely a perception that is used to pry one away from infatuation with the concept of a self, and that once this infatuation is gone the idea of not-self must be dropped as well. American monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu of the Thai Forest Tradition describes the Buddha's statements on non-self as a path to awakening rather than a universal truth. Thanissaro Bhikkhu states that the Buddha intentionally set the question of whether or not there is a self aside as a useless question, and that clinging to the idea that there is no self at all would actually \"prevent\" enlightenment.\n\nScholars Alexander Wynne and Rupert Gethin also take a similar position as Thanissaro Bhikkhu, arguing that the Buddha's description of non-self in the five aggregates does not necessarily mean there is no self, stating that the five aggregates are not descriptions of a human being but phenomena for one to observe. Wynne argues that the Buddha's statements on anattā are a \"not-self\" teaching rather than a \"no-self\" teaching.\n\nThanissaro Bhikkhu points to the Ananda Sutta, where the Buddha stays silent when asked whether there is a 'self' or not, as a major cause of the dispute. In Thailand, this dispute on the nature of teachings about 'self' and 'non-self' in Buddhism has led to arrest warrants, attacks and threats.\n\n\n\n"}
