The rule is based on the fact that the valence shells of transition metals consist of nine valence orbitals (one s orbital, three p orbitals and five d orbitals), which collectively can accommodate 18 electrons as either bonding or nonbonding electron pairs. This means that, the combination of these nine atomic orbitals with ligand orbitals creates nine molecular orbitals that are either metal-ligand bonding or non-bonding. When a metal complex has 18 valence electrons, it is said to have achieved the same electron configuration as the noble gas in the period. The rule and its exceptions are similar to the application of the octet rule to main group elements. The rule is not helpful for complexes of metals that are not transition metals, and \"interesting or useful transition metal complexes will violate the rule\" because of the consequences deviating from the rule bears on reactivity. The rule was first proposed by American chemist Irving Langmuir in 1921.\n\nThe rule usefully predicts the formulae for low-spin complexes of the Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co triads. Well-known examples include ferrocene, iron pentacarbonyl, chromium carbonyl, and nickel carbonyl. \n\nLigands in a complex determine the applicability of the 18-electron rule. In general, complexes that obey the rule are composed at least partly of π-acceptor ligands (also known as π-acids). This kind of ligand exerts a  very strong ligand field, which lowers the energies of the resultant molecular orbitals so that they are favorably occupied. Typical ligands include olefins, phosphines, and CO. Complexes of π-acids typically feature metal in a low-oxidation state. The relationship between oxidation state and the nature of the ligands is rationalized within the framework of π backbonding.\n\nCompounds that obey the 18-electron rule are typically \"exchange inert\". Examples include [Co(NH)]Cl, Mo(CO), and [Fe(CN)]. In such cases, in general ligand exchange occurs via dissociative substitution mechanisms, wherein the rate of reaction is determined by the rate of dissociation of a ligand. On the other hand, 18-electron compounds can be highly reactive toward electrophiles such as protons, and such reactions are associative in mechanism, being acid-base reactions.\n\nComplexes with fewer than 18 valence electrons tend to show enhanced reactivity. Thus, the 18-electron rule is often a recipe for non-reactivity in either a stoichiometric or a catalytic sense.\n\nCurrent computational findings suggest valence p-orbitals on the metal participate in metal-ligand bonding, albeit weakly. Some new theoretical treatments do not count the metal p-orbitals in metal-ligand bonding, although these orbitals are still included as polarization functions. This results in a duodectet (12-electron) rule for one s-orbital and five d-orbitals only, but the modified rule has yet to be adopted by the general chemistry community.\n\nπ-donor or σ-donor ligands with small interactions with the metal orbitals lead to a weak ligand field which increases the energies of t orbitals. These molecular orbitals become non-bonding or weakly anti-bonding orbitals (small Δ). Therefore, addition or removal of electron has little effect on complex stability. In this case, there is no restriction on the number of d-electrons and complexes with 12–22 electrons are possible. Small Δ makes filling e* possible (>18 e) and π-donor ligands can make t antibonding (<18 e). These types of ligand are located in the low-to-medium part of the spectrochemical series. For example: [TiF] (Ti(IV), d, 12 e), [Co(NH)] (Co(III), d, 18 e), [Cu(OH)] (Cu(II), d, 21 e).\n\nIn terms of metal ions, Δ increases down a group as well as with increasing oxidation number. Strong ligand fields lead to low-spin complexes which cause some exceptions to the 18-electron rule.\nAn important class of complexes that violate the 18e rule are the 16-electron complexes with metal d configurations. All high-spin d metal ions are octahedral (or tetrahedral), but the low-spin d metal ions are all square planar. Important examples of square-planar low-spin d metal Ions are Rh(I), Ir(I), Ni(II), Pd(II), and Pt(II). At picture below is shown the splitting of the d subshell in low-spin square-planar complexes. Examples are especially prevalent for derivatives of the cobalt and nickel triads. Such compounds are typically square-planar. The most famous example is Vaska's complex (IrCl(CO)(PPh)), [PtCl], and Zeise's salt [PtCl(\"η\"-CH)]. In such complexes, the d orbital is doubly occupied and nonbonding.\n\nMany catalytic cycles operate via complexes that alternate between 18-electron and square-planar 16-electron configurations. Examples include Monsanto acetic acid synthesis, hydrogenations, hydroformylations, olefin isomerizations, and some alkene polymerizations.\n\nOther violations can be classified according to the kinds of ligands on the metal center.\n\nBulky ligands can preclude the approach of the full complement of ligands that would allow the metal to achieve the 18 electron configuration.\nExamples: \nSometimes such complexes engage in agostic interactions with the hydrocarbon framework of the bulky ligand. For example:\n\nHigh-spin metal complexes have singly occupied orbitals and may not have any empty orbitals into which ligands could donate electron density. In general, there are few or no π-acidic ligands in the complex. These singly occupied orbitals can combine with the singly occupied orbitals of radical ligands (e.g., oxygen), or addition of a strong field ligand can cause electron-pairing, thus creating a vacant orbital that it can donate into.\nExamples: \nComplexes containing strongly π-donating ligands often violate the 18-electron rule. These ligands include fluoride (F), oxide (O), nitride (N), alkoxides (RO), and imides (RN). Examples:\nIn the latter case, there is substantial donation of the nitrogen lone pairs to the Mo (so the compound could also be described as a 16 e compound). This can be seen from the short Mo–N bond length, and from the angle Mo–N–C(R), which is nearly 180°.\nCounter-examples: \nIn these cases, the M=O bonds are \"pure\" double bonds (i.e., no donation of the lone pairs of the oxygen to the metal), as reflected in the relatively long bond distances.\n\nLigands where the coordinating atom bear nonbonding lone pairs often stabilize unsaturated complexes. Metal amides and alkoxides often violate the 18e rule.\n\nThe above factors can sometimes combine. Examples include \n\nSome complexes have more than 18 electrons. Examples:\n\nOften, cases where complexes have more than 18 valence electrons are attributed to electrostatic forces – the metal attracts ligands to itself to try to counterbalance its positive charge, and the number of electrons it ends up with is unimportant. In the case of the metallocenes, the chelating nature of the cyclopentadienyl ligand stabilizes its bonding to the metal. Somewhat satisfying are the two following observations: cobaltocene is a strong electron donor, readily forming the 18-electron cobaltocenium cation; and nickelocene tends to react with substrates to give 18-electron complexes, e.g. CpNiCl(PR) and free CpH.\n\nIn the case of nickelocene, the extra two electrons are in orbitals which are weakly metal-carbon antibonding; this is why it often participates in reactions where the M–C bonds are broken and the electron count of the metal changes to 18.\n\nThe 20-electron systems TM(CO) (TM = Sc, Y, La) have a cubic (\"O\") equilibrium geometry and a singlet (A) electronic ground state. There is one occupied valence MO with a symmetry, which is formed only by ligand orbitals without a contribution from the metal AOs. But the adducts TM(CO) (TM=Sc, Y, La) fulfill the 18-electron rule when one considers only those valence electrons, which occupy metal–ligand bonding orbitals.\n\n"}

The \"starting sentence\" is a short custodial sentence, and it is considered a more serious offence than common assault.\n\nThe constable must be acting \"in the execution of his duty\" for this offence to be made out. If he exceeds the remit of his duty (e.g. acts unlawfully in assaulting the Defendant), the offence will not be made out.\n\nThe Defendant does not actually have to be aware that the person he is assaulting is a constable.\n\nThe fact that the victim is a police officer is not, in itself, an aggravating factor which would justify more serious charge. The criteria for a charge under section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 do not distinguish between members of the public and police officers as the victim.\n\nAccording to \"R (Fullard) v Woking Magistrates' Court\" (2005) EWHC 2922 (Admin) a constable cannot be acting in the execution of their duty when unlawfully on private property. Thus, if the officer is not acting under the authority of a warrant, acting under a statutory or common law power of entry, or in hot pursuit, the person lawfully in possession of land is entitled to withdraw permission for the officer to remain. Should the officer refuse to leave, the officer will cease to be \"acting in the execution of their duty\". To make an effective withdrawal of permission, clear words must be used. Merely directing offensive remarks at the officer which amount to 'go away' will not necessarily withdraw any implied permission to enter or remain. Further, when properly required to leave, the officer must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to leave. However, once the opportunity to leave voluntarily has passed, it will not be an assault for the land owner to use reasonable force to cause the officer to leave.\n\nFor the purposes of section 89 of the Police Act 1996, any person who is carrying out surveillance in England and Wales under section 76A of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 is to be treated as if he were acting as a constable in the execution of his duty.\n\nSection 90 of the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.\n\nSection 66(1) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 (c.32) now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.\n\n\nThe offence of 'assault on a constable in the execution of his duty' was formerly created section 7(1)(a) of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968.\nIn Hong Kong this can be a summary offence, and also prosecutable under the Police Force Act or the Offences Against the Person Act. \n"}

BFFs are usually in close contact and have shared experiences, such as attending the same school or sharing musical tastes. Relationships described as BFF are common in high school and often decline when the parties go to college. The term BFF does not necessarily convey exclusivity; depending on a person's individual interpretation or philosophy of the concept of \"BFF\", an individual may not have more than one BFF simultaneously.\n\nAlthough the concept of having or being a \"best friend\" is ageless, the acronym BFF was popularized as a quick way for friends to sign off and express their positive feelings for one another while instant-messaging (IM-ing) on the computer or sending a text message on cell phones.\n\nThe acronym \"BFF\" was added to the New Oxford American Dictionary on 16 September 2010. The dictionary states that the acronym BFF originated in 1996.\n\nAccording to a survey in France, the BFF friendship is a concept that occupies a certain place on social networks. This value is reassuring, especially for the millennial generation that experiences a divorce frequently. It is a sign of social success and a balanced life.\n\nA large survey of friendship in the UK in 2003 found that on average, people had nine close friends. In elementary and middle school, best friendships often last less than one full academic year.\n\nBarbara Delinsky described a BFF as \"someone you don't have to see every day to still connect with, someone who loves you whether you talk often or not, someone who would drop everything and catch the next flight if you needed her. It's someone who couldn't care less where or what she eats, as long as she's with you.\"\n\nIn a 1997 episode, season 3 episode 25, of \"Friends\", Lisa Kudrow's character, Phoebe Buffay, uses the term.\n\nMichael Scott uses the abbreviation as well in S2E2 of \"The Office (U.S. TV series)\".\n\n\"Paris Hilton's My New BFF\", also known as \"My New BFF\", is a competitive reality television show in which Paris Hilton searches for her new BFF.\n\n\"Best Friends Forever\" was an American television comedy series that ran on NBC from April 4, to June 1, 2012.\n\nIn 2009, social networking service Myspace launched \"BFF\", an online game show series that tested how well best friends knew each other.\n\n\"Best Friends Forever (South Park)\" is an episode of Comedy Central's South Park, which first aired 30 March 2005, based on the Terri Schiavo case.\n\nEileen Kennedy-Moore says that parents can help children cope with a conflict between friends through strategies such as empathizing, discouraging retaliation, and encouraging relationship repair.\n\nIn 2010, the BFF concept was a part of a BFF contract \"to encourage the signatories to work through their differences before splitting up.\"\n\nIn their article \"Friendship and Natural Selection\" in July, 2014, Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler reported a positive correlation between close friendships and common genotypes, indicating that DNA similarities may be a causal factor in establishing friendships.\n\nIn a study conducted at the University of Oxford, Tamas David-Barrett and his colleagues reported that there is an unusually large number of profile pictures on Facebook that depict two women. This pattern is present in each region of the world. After eliminating the alternative hypotheses, the study concluded that the finding suggests that (a) close friendship formation patterns are universal among humans, and (b) there is a marked gender difference in the propensity to form lasting friendship due to an evolutionary ultimate cause. This suggests that the BFF concept, albeit with a different name, may exist in many cultures, going back to evolutionary times. Recent studies have also shown that close friends are treated as siblings throughout the lifespan.\n\nCompanies like Coca Cola have used the expression on some of their Cola products. Their cans say \"Share a Diet Coke with your BFF\".\n"}

{"id": "140711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140711", "title": "Capacitance", "text": "Capacitance\n\nCapacitance is the ratio of the change in an electric charge in a system to the corresponding change in its electric potential. There are two closely related notions of capacitance: \"self capacitance\" and \"mutual capacitance\". Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits \"self capacitance\". A material with a large self capacitance holds more electric charge at a given voltage than one with low capacitance. The notion of \"mutual capacitance\" is particularly important for understanding the operations of the capacitor, one of the three elementary linear electronic components (along with resistors and inductors).\n\nThe capacitance is a function only of the geometry of the design (e.g. area of the plates and the distance between them) and the permittivity of the dielectric material between the plates of the capacitor. For many dielectric materials, the permittivity and thus the capacitance, is independent of the potential difference between the conductors and the total charge on them.\n\nThe SI unit of capacitance is the farad (symbol: F), named after the English physicist Michael Faraday. A 1 farad capacitor, when charged with 1 coulomb of electrical charge, has a potential difference of 1 volt between its plates. The reciprocal of capacitance is called elastance.\n\nIn electrical circuits, the term \"capacitance\" is usually a shorthand for the \"mutual capacitance\" between two adjacent conductors, such as the two plates of a capacitor. However, for an isolated conductor, there also exists a property called \"self-capacitance\", which is the amount of electric charge that must be added to an isolated conductor to raise its electric potential by one unit (i.e. one volt, in most measurement systems). The reference point for this potential is a theoretical hollow conducting sphere, of infinite radius, with the conductor centered inside this sphere.\n\nMathematically, the \"self-capacitance\" of a conductor is defined by\nwhere\n\nUsing this method, the self-capacitance of a conducting sphere of radius \"R\" is:\n\nExample values of self-capacitance are:\n\nThe inter-winding capacitance of a coil is sometimes called self-capacitance, but this is a different phenomenon. It is actually mutual capacitance between the individual turns of the coil and is a form of stray, or parasitic capacitance. This self-capacitance is an important consideration at high frequencies: It changes the impedance of the coil and gives rise to parallel resonance. In many applications this is an undesirable effect and sets an upper frequency limit for the correct operation of the circuit.\n\nA common form is a parallel-plate capacitor, which consists of two conductive plates insulated from each other, usually sandwiching a dielectric material. In a parallel plate capacitor, capacitance is very nearly proportional to the surface area of the conductor plates and inversely proportional to the separation distance between the plates.\n\nIf the charges on the plates are +\"q\" and −\"q\", and \"V\" gives the voltage between the plates, then the capacitance \"C\" is given by\n\nwhich gives the voltage/current relationship\n\nThe energy stored in a capacitor is found by integrating the work \"W\":\n\nThe discussion above is limited to the case of two conducting plates, although of arbitrary size and shape.\nThe definition\nformula_8 does not apply when there are more than two charged plates, or when the net charge on the two plates is non-zero. To handle this case, Maxwell introduced his \"coefficients of potential\". If three (nearly ideal) conductors are given charges formula_9, then the voltage at conductor 1 is given by\n\nand similarly for the other voltages. Hermann von Helmholtz and Sir William Thomson showed that the coefficients of potential are symmetric, so that formula_11, etc. Thus the system can be described by a collection of coefficients known as the \"elastance matrix\" or \"reciprocal capacitance matrix\", which is defined as:\n\nFrom this, the mutual capacitance formula_13 between two objects can be defined by solving for the total charge \"Q\" and using formula_14.\n\nSince no actual device holds perfectly equal and opposite charges on each of the two \"plates\", it is the mutual capacitance that is reported on capacitors.\n\nThe collection of coefficients formula_16 is known as the \"capacitance matrix\", and is the inverse of the elastance matrix.\n\nThe capacitance of the majority of capacitors used in electronic circuits is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the farad. The most common subunits of capacitance in use today are the microfarad (µF), nanofarad (nF), picofarad (pF), and, in microcircuits, femtofarad (fF). However, specially made supercapacitors can be much larger (as much as hundreds of farads), and parasitic capacitive elements can be less than a femtofarad. In the past, alternate subunits were used in historical electronic books; \"mfd\" and \"mf\" for microfarad (µF); \"mmfd\", \"mmf\", \"µµF\" for picofarad (pF); but are rarely used any more.\n\nCapacitance can be calculated if the geometry of the conductors and the dielectric properties of the insulator between the conductors are known. A qualitative explanation for this can be given as follows.<br> Once a positive charge is put unto a conductor, this charge creates an electrical field, repelling any other positive charge to be moved onto the conductor; i.e., increasing the necessary voltage. But if nearby there is another conductor with a negative charge on it, the electrical field of the positive conductor repelling the second positive charge is weakened (the second positive charge also feels the attracting force of the negative charge). So due to the second conductor with a negative charge, it becomes easier to put a positive charge on the already positive charged first conductor, and vice versa; i.e., the necessary voltage is lowered. <br> As a quantitative example consider the capacitance of a capacitor constructed of two parallel plates both of area \"A\" separated by a distance \"d\". If \"d\" is sufficiently small with respect to the smallest chord of \"A\", there holds, to a high level of accuracy:\nwhere\n\nCapacitance is proportional to the area of overlap and inversely proportional to the separation between conducting sheets. The closer the sheets are to each other, the greater the capacitance.\nThe equation is a good approximation if \"d\" is small compared to the other dimensions of the plates so that the electric field in the capacitor area is uniform, and the so-called \"fringing field\" around the periphery provides only a small contribution to the capacitance.\n\nCombining the equation for capacitance with the above equation for the energy stored in a capacitance, for a flat-plate capacitor the energy stored is:\n\nwhere \"W\" is the energy, in joules; \"C\" is the capacitance, in farads; and \"V\" is the voltage, in volts.\n\nAny two adjacent conductors can function as a capacitor, though the capacitance is small unless the conductors are close together for long distances or over a large area. This (often unwanted) capacitance is called parasitic or \"stray capacitance\". Stray capacitance can allow signals to leak between otherwise isolated circuits (an effect called crosstalk), and it can be a limiting factor for proper functioning of circuits at high frequency.\n\nStray capacitance between the input and output in amplifier circuits can be troublesome because it can form a path for feedback, which can cause instability and parasitic oscillation in the amplifier. It is often convenient for analytical purposes to replace this capacitance with a combination of one input-to-ground capacitance and one output-to-ground capacitance; the original configuration — including the input-to-output capacitance — is often referred to as a pi-configuration. Miller's theorem can be used to effect this replacement: it states that, if the gain ratio of two nodes is 1/\"K\", then an impedance of \"Z\" connecting the two nodes can be replaced with a \"Z\"/(1 − \"k\") impedance between the first node and ground and a \"KZ\"/(\"K\" − 1) impedance between the second node and ground. Since impedance varies inversely with capacitance, the internode capacitance, \"C\", is replaced by a capacitance of KC from input to ground and a capacitance of (\"K\" − 1)\"C\"/\"K\" from output to ground. When the input-to-output gain is very large, the equivalent input-to-ground impedance is very small while the output-to-ground impedance is essentially equal to the original (input-to-output) impedance.\n\nCalculating the capacitance of a system amounts to solving the Laplace equation \"∇φ = 0\" with a constant potential \"φ\" on the surface of the conductors. This is trivial in cases with high symmetry. There is no solution in terms of elementary functions in more complicated cases.\n\nFor two-dimensional situations analytic functions may be used to map different geometries to each other. See also Schwarz–Christoffel mapping.\n\nThe energy (measured in joules) stored in a capacitor is equal to the \"work\" required to push the charges into the capacitor, i.e. to charge it. Consider a capacitor of capacitance \"C\", holding a charge +\"q\" on one plate and −\"q\" on the other. Moving a small element of charge d\"q\" from one plate to the other against the potential difference requires the work d\"W\":\n\nwhere \"W\" is the work measured in joules, \"q\" is the charge measured in coulombs and \"C\" is the capacitance, measured in farads.\n\nThe energy stored in a capacitor is found by integrating this equation. Starting with an uncharged capacitance () and moving charge from one plate to the other until the plates have charge +\"Q\" and −\"Q\" requires the work \"W\":\n\nThe capacitance of nanoscale dielectric capacitors such as quantum dots may differ from conventional formulations of larger capacitors. In particular, the electrostatic potential difference experienced by electrons in conventional capacitors is spatially well-defined and fixed by the shape and size of metallic electrodes in addition to the statistically large number of electrons present in conventional capacitors. In nanoscale capacitors, however, the electrostatic potentials experienced by electrons are determined by the number and locations of all electrons that contribute to the electronic properties of the device. In such devices, the number of electrons may be very small, however, the resulting spatial distribution of equipotential surfaces within the device are exceedingly complex.\n\nThe capacitance of a connected, or \"closed\", single-electron device is twice the capacitance of an unconnected, or \"open\", single-electron device. This fact may be traced more fundamentally to the energy stored in the single-electron device whose \"direct polarization\" interaction energy may be equally divided into the interaction of the electron with the polarized charge on the device itself due to the presence of the electron and the amount of potential energy required to form the polarized charge on the device (the interaction of charges in the device's dielectric material with the potential due to the electron).\n\nThe derivation of a \"quantum capacitance\" of a few-electron device involves the thermodynamic chemical potential of an \"N\"-particle system given by\n\nwhose energy terms may be obtained as solutions of the Schrödinger equation. The definition of capacitance,\n\nwith the potential difference\n\nmay be applied to the device with the addition or removal of individual electrons,\n\nThen\n\nis the \"quantum capacitance\" of the device.\n\nThis expression of \"quantum capacitance\" may be written as\n\nwhich differs from the conventional expression described in the introduction where formula_28, the stored electrostatic potential energy,\n\nby a factor of 1/2 with formula_30.\n\nHowever, within the framework of purely classical electrostatic interactions, the appearance of the factor of 1/2 is the result of integration in the conventional formulation,\n\nwhich is appropriate since formula_32 for systems involving either many electrons or metallic electrodes, but in few-electron systems, formula_33. The integral generally becomes a summation. One may trivially combine the expressions of capacitance and electrostatic interaction energy,\n\nrespectively, to obtain,\n\nwhich is similar to the quantum capacitance. A more rigorous derivation is reported in the literature. In particular, to circumvent the mathematical challenges of the spatially complex equipotential surfaces within the device, an \"average\" electrostatic potential experiences by \"each\" electron is utilized in the derivation.\n\nThe reason for apparent mathematical differences is understood more fundamentally as the potential energy, formula_37, of an isolated device (self-capacitance) is twice that stored in a \"connected\" device in the lower limit \"N\"=1. As \"N\" grows large, formula_38. Thus, the general expression of capacitance is\n\nIn nanoscale devices such as quantum dots, the \"capacitor\" is often an isolated, or partially isolated, component within the device. The primary differences between nanoscale capacitors and macroscopic (conventional) capacitors are the number of excess electrons (charge carriers, or electrons, that contribute to the device's electronic behavior) and the shape and size of metallic electrodes. In nanoscale devices, nanowires consisting of metal atoms typically do not exhibit the same conductive properties as their macroscopic, or bulk material, counterparts.\n\nIn electronic and semiconductor devices, transient or frequency-dependent current between terminals contains both conduction and displacement components. Conduction current is related to moving charge carriers (electrons, holes, ions, etc.), while displacement current is caused by time-varying electric field. Carrier transport is affected by electric field and by a number of physical phenomena - such as carrier drift and diffusion, trapping, injection, contact-related effects, impact ionization, etc. As a result, device admittance is frequency-dependent, and a simple electrostatic formula for capacitance formula_40 is not applicable. A more general definition of capacitance, encompassing electrostatic formula, is:\n\nwhere formula_42 is the device admittance, and formula_43 is the angular frequency.\n\nIn general case, capacitance is a function of frequency. At high frequencies, capacitance approached a constant value, equal to \"geometric\" capacitance, determined by the terminals' geometry and dielectric content in the device.\nA paper by Steven Laux presents a review of numerical techniques for capacitance calculation. In particular, capacitance can be calculated by a Fourier transform of a transient current in response to a step-like voltage excitation:\n\nUsually, capacitance in semiconductor devices is positive. However, in some devices and under certain conditions (temperature, applied voltages, frequency, etc.), capacitance can become negative. Non-monotonic behavior of the transient current in response to a step-like excitation has been proposed as the mechanism of negative capacitance. Negative capacitance has been demonstrated and explored in many different types of semiconductor devices.\n\n\n"}

The \"wall\" is thrown up to prevent leaks of corporate inside information, which could influence the advice given to clients making investments, and allow staff to take advantage of facts that are not yet known to the general public.\n\nThe phrase \"already over the wall\" is used by equity research personnel to refer to rank-and-file personnel who operate without the Chinese wall at all times. Examples include members of the Chinese wall department, most compliance personnel, attorneys and certain NYSE-licensed analysts. The term \"over the wall\" is used when an employee who is not normally privy to wall-guarded information somehow obtains sensitive information. Breaches considered semi-accidental were typically not met with punitive action during the heyday of the \"dot-com\" era. These and other instances involving conflicts of interest were rampant during this era. A major scandal was exposed when it was discovered that research analysts were encouraged to blatantly publish dishonest positive analyses on companies in which they, or related parties, owned shares, or on companies that depended on the investment banking departments of the same research firms. The U.S. government has since passed laws strengthening the Chinese wall such as Title V of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in order to prevent such conflicts of interest.\n\nChinese walls are also used in the corporate finance departments of the \"Big Four\" and other large accountancy and financial services firms. They are designed to insulate sensitive documentation from the wider firm in order to prevent conflicts.\n\nThe term is used in journalism to describe the separation between the editorial and advertising arms. The Chinese wall is regarded as breached for \"advertorial\" projects.\n\nThe term is used in property and casualty insurance to describe the separation of claim handling where both parties to a claim (e.g. an airport and an airline) have insurance policies with the same insurer. The claim handling process needs to be segregated within the organisation to avoid a conflict of interest.\n\nThis also occurs when there is an unidentified or uninsured motorist involved in an auto collision. In this case, two loss adjusters will take on the claim - one representing the insured party and another representing the uninsured or unidentified motorist. While they both represent the same policy, they both must investigate and negotiate to determine fault and what if anything is covered under the policy. In this case, a Chinese wall is erected between the two adjusters.\n\nChinese walls are used in law firms when one part of the firm representing a party on a deal or litigation is separated from another part of the firm with contrary interests or with confidential information from an adverse party. Under UK law, a firm may represent competing parties in a suit, but only in strictly defined situations and when individual fee earners do not act for both sides. In the United States, the use of \"Chinese Walls\" is no longer permitted except within very narrow exceptions. The American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2004) state: \"While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 or 1.9, unless the prohibition is based on a personal interest of the prohibited lawyer and does not present a significant risk of materially limiting the representation of the client by the remaining lawyers in the firm.\" Although ABA rules are only advisory, most U.S. states have adopted them or have even stricter regulations in place.\n\nIn computer science, the concept of a Chinese wall is used by both the operating system for computer security and the US judicial system for protection against copyright infringement. In computer security it concerns the software stability of the operating system. The same concept is involved in an important business matter concerning the \"licensing\" of each of a computer's many software and hardware components.\n\nAny hardware component that requires direct software interaction will have a license for itself and a license for its software \"driver\" running in the operating system. Reverse engineering software is a part of computer science that can involve writing a driver for a piece of hardware in order to enable it to work in an operating system unsupported by the manufacturer of the hardware, or to add functionality or increase the performance of its operations (not provided by the manufacturer) in the supported operating system, or to restore the usage of a piece of computer hardware for which the driver has disappeared altogether. A reverse engineered driver offers access to development, by persons outside the company that manufactured it, of the general hardware usage.\n\nThere is a case-law mechanism called \"clean room design\" that is employed to avoid copyright infringement when reverse engineering a proprietary driver.\n\nIt involves two separate engineering groups separated by a Chinese wall. One group works with the hardware to reverse engineer what must be the original algorithms and only documents their findings. The other group writes the code, based only on that documentation. Once the new code begins to function with tests on the hardware, it is able to be refined and developed over time.\n\nThis method insulates the new code from the old code, so that the reverse engineering is less likely to be considered by a jury as a derived work.\n\nThe basic model used to provide both privacy and integrity for data is the \"Chinese Wall Model\" or the \"Brewer and Nash Model\". It is a security model where read/write access to files is governed by membership of data in conflict-of-interest classes and datasets.\n\nThe origin of the phrase is the Great Wall of China. The term was popularized in the United States following the stock market crash of 1929, when the U.S. government legislated information separation between investment bankers and brokerage firms, in order to limit the conflict of interest between objective company analysis and the desire for successful initial public offerings. Rather than prohibiting one company from engaging in both businesses, the government permitted the implementation of Chinese wall procedures.\n\nA leading note on the subject published in 1980 in the \"University of Pennsylvania Law Review\" titled \"The Chinese Wall Defense to Law-Firm Disqualification\" perpetuated the use of the term.\n\n"}
{"id": "50405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50405", "title": "Clergy", "text": "Clergy\n\nClergy are some of the main and important formal leaders within certain religions. The roles and functions of clergy vary in different religious traditions but these usually involve presiding over specific rituals and teaching their religion's doctrines and practices. Some of the terms used for individual clergy are \"clergyman\", \"clergywoman\" and \"churchman\". Less common terms are \"churchwoman\", \"clergyperson\" and \"cleric\".\n\nIn Christianity the specific names and roles of clergy vary by denomination and there is a wide range of formal and informal clergy positions, including deacons, elders, priests, bishops, preachers, pastors, ministers and the Pope. In Islam, a religious leader is often known formally or informally as an imam, qadi, mufti, mullah or ayatollah. In Jewish tradition, a religious leader is often a rabbi (teacher) or hazzan (cantor).\n\nThe word \"Cleric\" comes from the ecclesiastical Latin \"Clericus\", for those belonging to the priestly class. In turn, the source of the Latin word is from the Ecclesiastical Greek \"Clericus\", meaning appertaining to an inheritance, in reference to the fact that the Levitical priests of the Old Testament had no inheritance except the Lord. \"Clergy\" is from two Old French words, \"clergié\" and \"clergie\", which refer to those with learning and derive from Medieval Latin \"clericatus\", from Late Latin \"clericus\" (the same word from which \"cleric\" is derived). \"Clerk\", which used to mean one ordained to the ministry, also derives from \"clericus\". In the Middle Ages, reading and writing were almost exclusively the domain of the priestly class, and this is the reason for the close relationship of these words. Within Christianity, especially in Eastern Christianity and formerly in Western Roman Catholicism, the term \"cleric\" refers to any individual who has been ordained, including deacons, priests, and bishops. In Latin Roman Catholicism, the tonsure was a prerequisite for receiving any of the minor orders or major orders before the tonsure, minor orders, and the subdiaconate were abolished following the Second Vatican Council. Now, the clerical state is tied to reception of the diaconate. Minor Orders are still given in the Eastern Catholic Churches, and those who receive those orders are 'minor clerics.'\n\nThe use of the word \"Cleric\" is also appropriate for Eastern Orthodox minor clergy who are tonsured in order not to trivialize orders such as those of Reader in the Eastern Church, or for those who are tonsured yet have no minor or major orders. It is in this sense that the word entered the Arabic language, most commonly in Lebanon from the French, as \"kleriki\" (or, alternatively, \"cleriki\") meaning \"seminarian.\" This is all in keeping with Eastern Orthodox concepts of clergy, which still include those who have not yet received, or do not plan to receive, the diaconate.\n\nA priesthood is a body of priests, shamans, or oracles who have special religious authority or function. The term priest is derived from the Greek presbyter (πρεσβύτερος, \"presbýteros\", elder or senior), but is often used in the sense of sacerdos in particular, i.e., for clergy performing ritual within the sphere of the sacred or numinous communicating with the gods on behalf of the community.\n\nBuddhist clergy are often collectively referred to as the Sangha, and consist of various orders of male and female monks (originally called bhikshus and bhikshunis respectively). This diversity of monastic orders and styles was originally one community founded by Gautama Buddha during the 5th century BC living under a common set of rules (called the Vinaya). According to scriptural records, these celibate monks and nuns in the time of the Buddha lived an austere life of meditation, living as wandering beggars for nine months out of the year and remaining in retreat during the rainy season (although such a unified condition of Pre-sectarian Buddhism is questioned by some scholars). However, as Buddhism spread geographically over time - encountering different cultures, responding to new social, political, and physical environments - this single form of Buddhist monasticism diversified. The interaction between Buddhism and Tibetan Bon led to a uniquely Tibetan Buddhism, within which various sects, based upon certain teacher-student lineages arose. Similarly, the interaction between Indian Buddhist monks (particularly of the Southern Madhyamika School) and Chinese Confucian and Taoist monks from c200-c900AD produced the distinctive Ch'an Buddhism. Ch'an, like the Tibetan style, further diversified into various sects based upon the transmission style of certain teachers (one of the most well known being the 'rapid enlightenment' style of Linji Yixuan), as well as in response to particular political developments such as the An Lushan Rebellion and the Buddhist persecutions of Emperor Wuzong. In these ways, manual labour was introduced to a practice where monks originally survived on alms; layers of garments were added where originally a single thin robe sufficed; etc. This adaptation of form and roles of Buddhist monastic practice continued after the transmission to Japan. For example, monks took on administrative functions for the Emperor in particular secular communities (registering births, marriages, deaths), thereby creating Buddhist 'priests'. Again, in response to various historic attempts to suppress Buddhism (most recently during the Meiji Era), the practice of celibacy was relaxed and Japanese monks allowed to marry. This form was then transmitted to Korea, during later Japanese occupation, where celibate and non-celibate monks today exist in the same sects. (Similar patterns can also be observed in Tibet during various historic periods multiple forms of monasticism have co-existed such as \"ngagpa\" lamas, and times at which celibacy was relaxed). As these varied styles of Buddhist monasticism are transmitted to Western cultures, still more new forms are being created.\n\nIn general, the Mahayana schools of Buddhism tend to be more culturally adaptive and innovative with forms, while Theravada schools (the form generally practised in Thailand, Burma, Cambodia and Sri Lanka) tend to take a much more conservative view of monastic life, and continue to observe precepts that forbid monks from touching women or working in certain secular roles. This broad difference in approach led to a major schism among Buddhist monastics in about the 4th century BCE, creating the Early Buddhist Schools.\n\nWhile female monastic (\"bhikkhuni\") lineages existed in most Buddhist countries at one time, the Theravada lineages of Southeast Asia died out during the 14th-15th Century AD. As there is some debate about whether the bhikkhuni lineage (in the more expansive Vinaya forms) was transmitted to Tibet, the status and future of female Buddhist clergy in this tradition is sometimes disputed by strict adherents to the Theravadan style. Some Mahayana sects, notably in the United States (such as San Francisco Zen Center) are working to reconstruct the female branches of what they consider a common, interwoven lineage.\n\nThe diversity of Buddhist traditions makes it difficult to generalize about Buddhist clergy. In the United States, Pure Land priests of the Japanese diaspora serve a role very similar to Protestant ministers of the Christian tradition. Meanwhile, reclusive Theravada forest monks in Thailand live a life devoted to meditation and the practice of austerities in small communities in rural Thailand- a very different life from even their city-dwelling counterparts, who may be involved primarily in teaching, the study of scripture, and the administration of the nationally organized (and government sponsored) Sangha. In the Zen traditions of China, Korea and Japan, manual labor is an important part of religious discipline; meanwhile, in the Theravada tradition, prohibitions against monks working as laborers and farmers continue to be generally observed.\n\nCurrently in North America, there are both celibate and non-celibate clergy in a variety of Buddhist traditions from around the world. In some cases they are forest dwelling monks of the Theravada tradition and in other cases they are married clergy of a Japanese Zen lineage and may work a secular job in addition to their role in the Buddhist community. There is also a growing realization that traditional training in ritual and meditation as well as philosophy may not be sufficient to meet the needs and expectations of American lay people. Some communities have begun exploring the need for training in counseling skills as well. Along these lines, at least two fully accredited Master of Divinity programs are currently available: one at Naropa University in Boulder, CO and one at the University of the West in Rosemead, CA.\n\nIn general, Christian clergy are ordained; that is, they are set apart for specific ministry in religious rites. Others who have definite roles in worship but who are not ordained (e.g. laypeople acting as acolytes) are generally not considered clergy, even though they may require some sort of official approval to exercise these ministries.\n\nTypes of clerics are distinguished from offices, even when the latter are commonly or exclusively occupied by clerics. A Roman Catholic cardinal, for instance, is almost without exception a cleric, but a cardinal is not a type of cleric. An archbishop is not a distinct type of cleric, but is simply a bishop who occupies a particular position with special authority. Conversely, a youth minister at a parish may or may not be a cleric. Different churches have different systems of clergy, though churches with similar polity have similar systems.\n\nIn Anglicanism, clergy consist of the orders of deacons, priests (presbyters) and bishops in ascending order of seniority. \"Canon\", \"archdeacon\", \"archbishop\" and the like are specific positions within these orders. Bishops are typically overseers, presiding over a diocese composed of many parishes, with an archbishop presiding over a province, which is a group of dioceses. A parish (generally a single church) is looked after by one or more priests, although one priest may be responsible for several parishes. New clergy are ordained deacons. Those seeking to become priests are usually ordained priest after a year. Since the 1960s some Anglican churches have reinstituted the diaconate as a permanent, rather than transitional, order of ministry focused on ministry that bridges the church and the world, especially ministry to those on the margins of society.\n\nFor the forms of address for Anglican clergy, see Forms of address in the United Kingdom.\n\nFor a short period of history before the ordination of women as deacons, priests and bishops began within Anglicanism they could be \"deaconesses\". Although they were usually considered having a ministry distinct from deacons they often had similar ministerial responsibilities.\n\nIn Anglican churches all clergy are permitted to marry. In most national churches women may become deacons or priests, but while fifteen out of 38 national churches allow for the consecration of women as bishops, only five have ordained any. Celebration of the Eucharist is reserved for priests and bishops.\n\nNational Anglican churches are presided over by one or more primates or metropolitans (archbishops or presiding bishops). The senior archbishop of the Anglican Communion is the Archbishop of Canterbury, who acts as leader of the Church of England and 'first among equals' of the primates of all Anglican churches.\n\nBeing a deacon, priest or bishop is considered a function of the person and not a job. When priests retire they are still priests even if they no longer have any active ministry. However, they only hold the basic rank after retirement. Thus a retired archbishop can only be considered a bishop (though it is possible to refer to 'Bishop John Smith, the former Archbishop of York'), a canon or archdeacon is a priest on retirement and does not hold any additional honorifics.\n\nOrdained clergy in the Roman Catholic Church are either deacons, priests, or bishops belonging to the diaconate, the presbyterate, or the episcopate, respectively. Among bishops, some are metropolitans, archbishops, or patriarchs. The Pope is the Bishop of Rome, the supreme and universal hierarch of the Church, and his authorization is now required for the ordination of all Catholic bishops. With rare exceptions, cardinals are bishops, although it was not always so; formerly, some cardinals were people who had received clerical tonsure, but not Holy Orders. Secular clergy are ministers, such as deacons and priests, who do not belong to a religious institute and live in the world at large, rather than a religious institute (\"saeculum\"). The Holy See supports the activity of its clergy by the Congregation for the Clergy (), a dicastery of Roman curia.\n\nCanon Law indicates (canon 207) that \"[b]y divine institution, there are among the Christian faithful in the Church sacred ministers who in law are also called clerics; the other members of the Christian faithful are called lay persons\". This distinction of a separate ministry was formed in the early times of Christianity; one early source reflecting this distinction, with the three ranks or orders of bishop, priest and deacon, is the writings of Saint Ignatius of Antioch.\n\nHoly Orders is one of the Seven Sacraments, enumerated at the Council of Trent, that the Magisterium considers to be of divine institution. In the Roman Catholic Church, only men are permitted to be clerics, although in antiquity women were ordained to the diaconate.\n\nIn the Latin Church before 1972, tonsure admitted someone to the clerical state, after which he could receive the four minor orders (ostiary, lectorate, order of exorcists, order of acolytes) and then the major orders of subdiaconate, diaconate, presbyterate, and finally the episcopate, which according to Roman Catholic doctrine is \"the fullness of Holy Orders\". Since 1972 the minor orders and the subdiaconate have been replaced by lay ministries and clerical tonsure no longer takes place, except in some Traditionalist Catholic groups, and the clerical state is acquired, even in those groups, by Holy Orders. In the Latin Church the initial level of the three ranks of Holy Orders is that of the diaconate. In addition to these three orders of clerics, some Eastern Catholic, or \"Uniate\", Churches have what are called \"minor clerics\".\n\nMembers of institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life are clerics only if they have received Holy Orders. Thus, unordained monks, friars, nuns, and religious brothers and sisters are not part of the clergy.\n\nThe Code of Canon Law and the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches prescribe that every cleric must be enrolled or \"incardinated\" in a diocese or its equivalent (an apostolic vicariate, territorial abbey, personal prelature, etc.) or in a religious institute, society of apostolic life or secular institute. The need for this requirement arose because of the trouble caused from the earliest years of the Church by unattached or vagrant clergy subject to no ecclesiastical authority and often causing scandal wherever they went.\n\nCurrent canon law prescribes that to be ordained a priest, an education is required of two years of philosophy and four of theology, including study of dogmatic and moral theology, the Holy Scriptures, and canon law have to be studied within a seminary or an ecclesiastical faculty at a university.\n\nRoman Catholicism mandates clerical celibacy for all clergy in the predominant Latin Rite, with the exception of deacons who do not intend to become priests. Exceptions are sometimes admitted for ordination to transitional diaconate and priesthood on a case-by-case basis for married clergymen of other churches or communities who become Catholics, but ordination of married men to the episcopacy is excluded (see personal ordinariate). Clerical marriage is not allowed and therefore, if those for whom in some particular Church celibacy is optional (such as permanent deacons in the Latin Church) wish to marry, they must do so before ordination. Eastern Catholic Churches either follow the same rules as the Latin Church or require celibacy only for bishops.\n\nIn the High Middle Ages, clergy in Western Europe had four privileges:\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has no dedicated clergy, and is governed instead by a system of lay priesthood leaders. Locally, unpaid and part-time priesthood holders lead the church; the worldwide church is supervised by full-time general authorities, some of whom receive modest living allowances. No formal theological training is required for any position. All leaders in the church are called by revelation and the laying on of hands by one who holds authority. Jesus Christ stands at the head of the church and leads the church through revelation given to the President of the Church, the First Presidency, and Twelve Apostles, all of whom are recognized as prophets, seers, and revelators and have lifetime tenure. Below these men in the hierarchy are quorums of seventy, which are assigned geographically over the areas of the church. Locally, the church is divided into stakes; each stake has a president, who is assisted by two counselors and a high council. The stake is made up of several individual congregations, which are called \"wards\" or \"branches.\" Wards are led by a bishop and his counselors and branches by a president and his counselors. Local leaders serve in their positions until released by their supervising authorities.\n\nGenerally, all worthy males age 12 and above receive the priesthood. Youth age 12 to 18 are ordained to the Aaronic priesthood as deacons, teachers, or priests, which authorizes them to perform certain ordinances and sacraments. Adult males are ordained to the Melchizedek priesthood, as elders, seventies, high priests, or patriarchs in that priesthood, which is concerned with spiritual leadership of the church. Although the term \"clergy\" is not typically used in the LDS Church, it would most appropriately apply to local bishops and stake presidents. Merely holding an office in the priesthood does not imply authority over other church members or agency to act on behalf of the entire church.\n\nThe Orthodox Church has three ranks of holy orders: bishop, priest, and deacon. These are the same offices identified in the New Testament and found in the Early Church, as testified by the writings of the Holy Fathers. Each of these ranks is ordained through the Sacred Mystery (sacrament) of the laying on of hands (called \"cheirotonia\") by bishops. Priests and deacons are ordained by their own diocesan bishop, while bishops are consecrated through the laying on of hands of at least three other bishops.\n\nWithin each of these three ranks there are found a number of titles. Bishops may have the title of archbishop, metropolitan, and patriarch, all of which are considered honorifics. Among the Orthodox, all bishops are considered equal, though an individual may have a place of higher or lower honor, and each has his place within the order of precedence. Priests (also called presbyters) may (or may not) have the title of archpriest, protopresbyter (also called \"protopriest\", or \"protopope\"), hieromonk (a monk who has been ordained to the priesthood) archimandrite (a senior hieromonk) and hegumen (abbot). Deacons may have the title of hierodeacon (a monk who has been ordained to the deaconate), archdeacon or protodeacon.\n\nThe lower clergy are not ordained through \"cheirotonia\" (laying on of hands) but through a blessing known as \"cheirothesia\" (setting-aside). These clerical ranks are subdeacon, reader and altar server (also known as taper-bearer). Some churches have a separate service for the blessing of a cantor.\n\nOrdination of a bishop, priest, deacon or subdeacon must be conferred during the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist)—though in some churches it is permitted to ordain up through deacon during the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts—and no more than a single individual can be ordained to the same rank in any one service. Numerous members of the lower clergy may be ordained at the same service, and their blessing usually takes place during the Little Hours prior to Liturgy, or may take place as a separate service. The blessing of readers and taper-bearers is usually combined into a single service. Subdeacons are ordained during the Little Hours, but the ceremonies surrounding his blessing continue through the Divine Liturgy, specifically during the Great Entrance.\n\nBishops are usually drawn from the ranks of the archimandrites, and are required to be celibate; however, a non-monastic priest may be ordained to the episcopate if he no longer lives with his wife (following Canon XII of the Quinisext Council of Trullo) In contemporary usage such a non-monastic priest is usually tonsured to the monastic state, and then elevated to archimandrite, at some point prior to his consecration to the episcopacy. Although not a formal or canonical prerequisite, at present bishops are often required to have earned a university degree, typically but not necessarily in theology.\n\nUsual titles are \"Your Holiness\" for a patriarch (with \"Your All-Holiness\" reserved for the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople), \"Your Beatitude\" for an archbishop/metropolitan overseeing an autocephalous Church, \"Your Eminence\" for an archbishop/metropolitan generally, \"Master\" or \"Your Grace\" for a bishop and \"Father\" for priests, deacons and monks, although there are variations between the various Orthodox Churches. For instance, in Churches associated with the Greek tradition, while the Ecumenical Patriarch is addressed as \"Your All-Holiness,\" all other Patriarchs (and archbishops/metropolitans who oversee autocephalous Churches) are addressed as \"Your Beatitude.\"\n\nOrthodox priests, deacons, and subdeacons must be either married or celibate (preferably monastic) prior to ordination, but may not marry after ordination. \"Re\"marriage of clergy following divorce or widowhood is forbidden. Married clergy are considered as best-suited to staff parishes, as a priest with a family is thought better qualified to counsel his flock. It has been common practice in the Russian tradition for unmarried, non-monastic clergy to occupy academic posts.\n\nClergy in Protestantism fill a wide variety of roles and functions. In many denominations, such as Methodism, Presbyterianism, and Lutheranism, the roles of clergy are similar to Roman Catholic or Anglican clergy, in that they hold an ordained pastoral or priestly office, administer the sacraments, proclaim the word, lead a local church or parish, and so forth. The Baptist tradition only recognizes two ordained positions in the church as being the elders (pastors) and deacons as outlined in the third chapter of I Timothy in the Bible. The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) ordains two types of presbyters or elders, teaching (pastor) and ruling (leaders of the congregation which form a council with the pastors). Teaching elders are seminary trained and ordained as a presbyter and set aside on behalf of the whole denomination to the ministry of Word and Sacrament. Ordinarily, teaching elders are installed by a presbytery as pastor of a congregation. Ruling elders, after receiving training, may be commissioned by a presbytery to serve as a pastor of a congregation, as well as preach and administer sacraments.\n\nThe process of being designated as a member of the Protestant clergy, as well as that of being assigned to a particular office, varies with the denomination or faith group. Some Protestant denominations, such as Methodism, Presbyterianism, and Lutheranism, are hierarchical in nature; and ordination and assignment to individual pastorates or other ministries are made by the parent denominations. In other traditions, such as the Baptist and other Congregational groups, local churches are free to hire (and often ordain) their own clergy, although the parent denominations typically maintain lists of suitable candidates seeking appointment to local church ministries and encourage local churches to consider these individuals when filling available positions.\n\nSome Protestant denominations require that candidates for ordination be \"licensed\" to the ministry for a period of time (typically one to three years) prior to being ordained. This period typically is spent performing the duties of ministry under the guidance, supervision, and evaluation of a more senior, ordained minister. In some denominations, however, licensure is a permanent, rather than a transitional state for ministers assigned to certain specialized ministries, such as music ministry or youth ministry.\n\nMany Protestant denominations reject the idea that the clergy are a separate category of people, but rather stress the \"priesthood of all believers\". Based on this theological approach, most Protestants do not have a sacrament of ordination like the pre-Reformation churches. Protestant ordination, therefore, can be viewed more as a public statement by the ordaining body that an individual possesses the theological knowledge, moral fitness, and practical skills required for service in that faith group's ministry. Some Lutheran churches form an exception to this rule, as the Lutheran Book of Concord allows ordination to be received as a sacrament.\n\nSome Protestant denominations dislike the word \"clergy\" and do not use it of their own leaders. Often they refer to their leaders as pastors or ministers, titles that, if used, sometimes apply to the person only as long as he or she holds a particular office.\n\nIslam, like Judaism, has no clergy in the sacerdotal sense; there is no institution resembling the Christian priesthood. Islamic religious leaders do not \"serve as intermediaries between mankind and God\", have \"process of ordination\", nor \"sacramental functions\". They have been said to resemble more rabbis, serving as \"exemplars, teachers, judges, and community leaders,\" providing religious rules to the pious on \"even the most minor and private\" matters.\n\nThe title \"mullah\" (a Persian variation of the Arabic \"maula\", \"master\"), commonly translated \"cleric\" in the West and thought to be analogous to \"priest\" or \"rabbi\", is a title of address for any educated or respected figure, not even necessarily (though frequently) religious. The title \"sheikh\" (\"elder\") is used similarly.\n\nMost of the religious titles associated with Islam are scholastic or academic in nature: they recognize the holder's exemplary knowledge of the theory and practice of \"ad-dín\" (religion), and do not confer any particular spiritual or sacerdotal authority. The most general such title is \"`alim\" (pl. \"`ulamah\"), or \"scholar\". This word describes someone engaged in advanced study of the traditional Islamic sciences \"(`ulum)\" at an Islamic university or \"madrasah jami`ah\". A scholar's opinions may be valuable to others because of his/her knowledge in religious matters; but such opinions should not generally be considered binding, infallible, or absolute, as the individual Muslim is directly responsible to God for his or her own religious beliefs and practice.\n\nThe nearest analogue among Sunni Muslims to the parish priest or pastor, or to the \"pulpit rabbi\" of a synagogue, is called the \"imam khatib.\" This compound title is merely a common combination of two elementary offices: leader \"(imam)\" of the congregational prayer, which in most mosques is performed at the times of all daily prayers; and preacher \"(khatib)\" of the sermon or \"khutba\" of the obligatory congregational prayer at midday every Friday. Although either duty can be performed by anyone who is regarded as qualified by the congregation, at most well-established mosques \"imam khatib\" is a permanent part-time or full-time position. He may be elected by the local community, or appointed by an outside authority – \"e. g.,\" the national government, or the waqf which sustains the mosque. There is no ordination as such; the only requirement for appointment as an \"imam khatib\" is recognition as someone of sufficient learning and virtue to perform both duties on a regular basis, and to instruct the congregation in the basics of Islam.\n\nThe title \"hafiz\" (lit. \"preserver\") is awarded to one who has memorized the entire Qur'an, often by attending a special course for the purpose; the \"imam khatib\" of a mosque is frequently (though not always) a \"hafiz.\"\n\nThere are several specialist offices pertaining to the study and administration of Islamic law or \"shari`ah.\" A scholar with a specialty in \"fiqh\" or jurisprudence is known as a \"faqih\". A \"qadi\" is a judge in an Islamic court. A \"mufti\" is a scholar who has completed an advanced course of study which qualifies him to issue judicial opinions or \"fatawah\".\n\nIn modern Shia Islam, scholars play a more prominent role in the daily lives of Muslims than in Sunni Islam; and there is a hierarchy of higher titles of scholastic authority, such as \"Ayatollah\". Since around the mid-19th century, a more complex title has been used in Twelver Shi`ism, namely \"marjaʿ at-taqlid\". \"Marjaʿ\" (pl. \"marajiʿ\") means \"source\", and \"taqlid\" refers to religious emulation or imitation. Lay Shi`ah must identify a specific \"marjaʿ\" whom they emulate, according to his legal opinions \"(fatawah)\" or other writings. On several occasions, the \"Marjaʿiyyat\" (community of all \"marajiʿ\") has been limited to a single individual, in which case his rulings have been applicable to all those living in the Twelver Shi'ah world. Of broader importance has been the role of the \"mujtahid\", a cleric of superior knowledge who has the authority to perform \"ijtihad\" (independent judgment). Mujtahids are few in number, but it is from their ranks that the \"marajiʿ at-taqlid\" are drawn.\n\nThe spiritual guidance function known in many Christian denominations as \"pastoral care\" is fulfilled for many Muslims by a \"murshid\" (\"guide\"), a master of the spiritual sciences and disciplines known as \"tasawuf\" or Sufism. Sufi guides are commonly styled \"Shaikh\" in both speaking and writing; in North Africa they are sometimes called \"marabouts\". They are traditionally appointed by their predecessors, in an unbroken teaching lineage reaching back to Muhammad. (The lineal succession of guides bears a superficial similarity to Christian ordination and apostolic succession, or to Buddhist dharma transmission; but a Sufi guide is regarded primarily as a specialized teacher and Islam denies the existence of an earthly hierarchy among believers.)\n\nMuslims who wish to learn Sufism dedicate themselves to a \"murshid\"&apos;s guidance by taking an oath called a \"bai'ah\". The aspirant is then known as a \"murid\" (\"disciple\" or \"follower\"). A \"murid\" who takes on special disciplines under the guide's instruction, ranging from an intensive spiritual retreat to voluntary poverty and homelessness, is sometimes known as a dervish.\n\nDuring the Islamic Golden Age, it was common for scholars to attain recognized mastery of both the \"exterior sciences\" \"(`ulum az-zahir)\" of the madrasahs as well as the \"interior sciences\" \"(`ulum al-batin)\" of Sufism. Al-Ghazali and Rumi are two notable examples.\n\nThe highest office an Ahmadi can hold is that of \"Khalifatu l-Masih\". Such a person may appoint amirs who manage regional areas. The consultative body for Ahmadiyya is called the \"Majlis-i-Shura\", which ranks second in importance to the \"Khalifatu l-Masih\". However, the Ahmadiyya community is declared as non-Muslims by many mainstream Muslims and they reject the messianic claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.\n\nRabbinic Judaism does not have clergy as such, although according to the Torah there is a tribe of priests known as the Kohanim who were leaders of the religion up to the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 70 AD when most Sadducees were wiped out; each member of the tribe, a Kohen had priestly duties, many of which centered around the sacrificial duties, atonement and blessings of the Israelite nation. Today, Jewish Kohanim know their status by family tradition, and still offer the priestly blessing during certain services in the synagogue and perform the \"Pidyon haben\" (redemption of the first-born son) ceremony.\n\nSince the time of the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, the religious leaders of Judaism have often been rabbis, who are technically scholars in Jewish law empowered to act as judges in a rabbinical court. All types of Judaism except Orthodox Judaism allow women as well as men to be ordained as rabbis and cantors. The leadership of a Jewish congregation is, in fact, in the hands of the laity: the president of a synagogue is its actual leader and any adult male Jew (or adult Jew in non-traditional congregations) can lead prayer services. The rabbi is not an occupation found in the Torah; the first time this word is mentioned is in the Mishnah. The modern form of the rabbi developed in the Talmudic era. Rabbis are given authority to make interpretations of Jewish law and custom. Traditionally, a man obtains one of three levels of Semicha (rabbinic ordination) after the completion of an arduous learning program in Torah, Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), Mishnah and Talmud, Midrash, Jewish ethics and lore, the codes of Jewish law and responsa, theology and philosophy.\nSince the early medieval era an additional communal role, the \"Hazzan\" (cantor) has existed as well. Cantors have sometimes been the only functionaries of a synagogue, empowered to undertake religio-civil functions like witnessing marriages. Cantors do provide leadership of actual services, primarily because of their training and expertise in the music and prayer rituals pertaining to them, rather than because of any spiritual or \"sacramental\" distinction between them and the laity. Cantors as much as rabbis have been recognized by civil authorities in the United States as clergy for legal purposes, mostly for awarding education degrees and their ability to perform weddings, and certify births and deaths.\n\nAdditionally, Jewish authorities license \"mohels\", people specially trained by experts in Jewish law and usually also by medical professionals to perform the ritual of circumcision. Traditional Orthodox Judaism does not license women as mohels, but other types of Judaism do. They are appropriately called \"mohelot\" (pl. of \"mohelet,\" f. of mohel)\n. As the Jewish News Weekly of Northern California states, \"...there is no halachic prescription against female mohels, [but] none exist in the Orthodox world, where the preference is that the task be undertaken by a Jewish man.\".\n\nIn many places, mohels are also licensed by civil authorities, as circumcision is technically a surgical procedure. Kohanim, who must avoid contact with dead human body parts (such as the removed foreskin) for ritual purity, cannot act as mohels, but some mohels are also either rabbis or cantors.\n\nAnother licensed cleric in Judaism is the \"shochet\", who are trained and licensed by religious authorities for kosher slaughter according to ritual law. A Kohen may be a shochet. Most shochetim are ordained rabbis. \n\nThen there is the \"mashgiach\". A \"mashgiach\" is someone who supervises the \"kashrut\" status of a kosher establishment. The \"mashgiach\" must know the Torah laws of \"kashrut\", and how they apply in the environment he is supervising. Obviously, this can vary. In many instances, the \"mashgiach\" is a rabbi. This helps, since rabbinical students learn the laws of kosher as part of their syllabus. However, not every \"mashgiach\" is a rabbi, and not every rabbi is qualified to be a \"mashgiach\".\n\nIn contemporary Orthodox Judaism, women are forbidden from becoming rabbis or cantors in the Orthodox world primarily because this would affect many aspects of communal observances and practices . Most Orthodox rabbinical seminaries or yeshivas also require dedication of many years to education, but few require a formal degree from a civil education institutions that often define Christian clergy. Training is often focused on Jewish law, and some Orthodox Yeshivas forbid secular education.\n\nIn Hasidic Judaism, generally understood as a branch of Orthodox Judaism, there are dynastic spiritual leaders known as \"Rebbes\", often translated in English as \"Grand Rabbi\". The office of Rebbe is generally a hereditary one, may also be passed from Rebbe to student, or recognized by a congregation conferring a sort of coronation to their new Rebbe. Although one does not need to be an ordained Rabbi to be a Rebbe, most Rebbes today are ordained Rabbis. Since one does not need to be an ordained rabbi to be a Rebbe, at some points in history there were female Rebbes as well, particularly the Maiden of Ludmir.\n\nIn Conservative Judaism, both men and women are ordained as rabbis and cantors. Conservative Judaism differs with Orthodoxy in that it sees Jewish Law as binding but also as subject to many interpretations, including more liberal interpretations. Academic requirements for becoming a rabbi are rigorous. First earn a bachelor's degree before entering rabbinical school. Studies are mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of Judaism and most importantly the academic study of Bible, Talmud and rabbinic literature, philosophy and theology, liturgy, Jewish history, and Hebrew literature of all periods.\n\nReconstructionist Judaism and Reform Judaism do not maintain the traditional requirements for study as rooted in Jewish Law and traditionalist text. Both men and women may be rabbis or cantors. The rabbinical seminaries of these movements hold that one must first earn a bachelor's degree before entering the rabbinate. In addition studies are mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of Judaism; and academic biblical criticism. Emphasis is placed not on Jewish law, but rather on sociology, modern Jewish philosophy, Theology and Pastoral Care.\n\nSikh clergy consists of five \"Jathedars\", one each from five \"takhts\" or sacred seats. The \"Jathedars\" are appointed by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), an elected body of the Sikhs sometimes called the \"Parliament of Sikhs.\" The highest seat of the Sikh religion is called \"Akal Takht\" and the \"Jathedar\" of \"Akal Takht\" makes all the important decisions after consultations with the \"Jathedars\" of the other four \"takhts\" and the SGPC.\n\nHistorically traditional (or \"pagan\") religions typically combine religious authority and political power. What this means is that the sacred king or queen is therefore seen to combine both kingship and priesthood within his or her person, even though he or she is often aided by an actual high priest or priestess (see, for example, the Maya priesthood). When the functions of political ruler and religious leader are combined in this way, deification could be seen to be the next logical stage of his or her social advancement within his or her native environment, as is found in the case of the Egyptian Pharaohs. The Vedic priesthood of India is an early instance of a structured body of clergy organized as a separate and hereditary caste, one that occupied the highest social rung of its nation. A modern example of this phenomenon the priestly monarchs of the Yoruba holy city of Ile-Ife in Nigeria, whose reigning Onis have performed ritual ceremonies for centuries for the sustenance of the entire planet and its people.\n\nIn recent years, studies have suggested that American clergy in certain Protestant, Evangelical and Jewish traditions are more at risk than the general population of obesity, hypertension and depression. Their life expectancies have fallen in recent years and in the last decade their use of antidepressants has risen. Several religious bodies in the United States (Methodist, Episcopal, Baptist and Lutheran) have implemented measures to address the issue, through wellness campaigns, for example - but also by simply ensuring that clergy take more time off. It is unclear whether similar symptoms affect American Muslim clerics, although an anecdotal comment by one American imam suggested that leaders of mosques may also share these problems.\n\nOne exception to the findings of these studies is the case of American Catholic priests, who are required by canon law to take a spiritual retreat each year, and four weeks of vacation. Sociological studies at the University of Chicago have confirmed this exception; the studies also took the results of several earlier studies into consideration and included Roman Catholic priests nationwide. It remains unclear whether American clergy in other religious traditions experience the same symptoms, or whether clergy outside the United States are similarly affected.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50263", "title": "Domain of a function", "text": "Domain of a function\n\nIn mathematics, and more specifically in naive set theory, the domain of definition (or simply the domain) of a function is the set of \"input\" or argument values for which the function is defined. That is, the function provides an \"output\" or value for each member of the domain. Conversely, the set of values the function takes on as output is termed the image of the function, which is sometimes also referred to as the range of the function.\n\nFor instance, the domain of cosine is the set of all real numbers, while the domain of the square root consists only of numbers greater than or equal to 0 (ignoring complex numbers in both cases).\n\nIf the domain of a function is a subset of the real numbers and the function is represented in a Cartesian coordinate system, then the domain is represented on the \"X\"-axis.\nGiven a function formula_1, the set formula_2 is the domain of formula_3; the set formula_4 is the codomain of formula_3. In the expression formula_6, formula_7 is the argument and formula_6 is the value. One can think of an argument as a member of the domain that is chosen as an \"input\" to the function, and the value as the \"output\" when the function is applied to that member of the domain.\n\nThe image (sometimes called the range) of formula_3 is the set of all values assumed by formula_3 for all possible formula_7; this is the set formula_12. The image of formula_3 can be the same set as the codomain or it can be a proper subset of it. It is, in general, smaller than the codomain; it is the whole codomain if and only if formula_3 is a surjective function.\n\nA well-defined function must map every element of its domain to an element of its codomain. For example, the function formula_3 defined by\nhas no value for formula_17. Thus, the set of all real numbers, formula_18, cannot be its domain. In cases like this, the function is either defined on formula_19 or the \"gap is plugged\" by explicitly defining formula_17.\nIf we extend the definition of formula_3 to\nthen \"f\" is defined for all real numbers, and its domain is formula_18.\n\nAny function can be restricted to a subset of its domain. The restriction of formula_24 to formula_25, where formula_26, is written formula_27.\n\nThe natural domain of a function is the maximum set of values for which the function is defined, typically within the reals but sometimes among the integers or complex numbers. For instance the natural domain of square root is the non-negative reals when considered as a real number function. When considering a natural domain, the set of possible values of the function is typically called its range.\n\nThere are two distinct meanings in current mathematical usage for the notion of the domain of a partial function from \"X\" to \"Y\", i.e. a function from a subset \"X\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> of \"X\" to \"Y\". Most mathematicians, including recursion theorists, use the term \"domain of \"f\"\" for the set \"X\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> of all values \"x\" such that \"f\"(\"x\") is defined. But some, particularly category theorists, consider the domain to be \"X\", irrespective of whether \"f\"(\"x\") exists for every \"x\" in \"X\".\n\nIn category theory one deals with morphisms instead of functions. Morphisms are arrows from one object to another. The domain of any morphism is the object from which an arrow starts. In this context, many set theoretic ideas about domains must be abandoned or at least formulated more abstractly. For example, the notion of restricting a morphism to a subset of its domain must be modified. See subobject for more.\n\nIn real and complex analysis, a domain is an open connected subset of a real or complex vector space.\n\nIn partial differential equations, a domain is an open connected subset of the Euclidean space formula_28, where the problem is posed, i.e., where the unknown function(s) are defined.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "264094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264094", "title": "Dorothy Day", "text": "Dorothy Day\n\nDorothy Day (November 8, 1897 – November 29, 1980) was an American journalist, social activist, and Catholic convert. Day initially lived a bohemian lifestyle before gaining fame as a social activist after her conversion. She later became a key figure in the Catholic Worker Movement and earned a national reputation as a political radical, perhaps the most famous radical in American Catholic Church history.\n\nDay's conversion is described in her autobiography, \"The Long Loneliness\". Day was also an active journalist, and described her social activism in her writings. In 1917 she was imprisoned as a member of suffragist Alice Paul's nonviolent Silent Sentinels. In the 1930s, Day worked closely with fellow activist Peter Maurin to establish the Catholic Worker Movement, a pacifist movement that combines direct aid for the poor and homeless with nonviolent direct action on their behalf. She practiced civil disobedience, which led to additional arrests in 1955, 1957, and in 1973 at the age of seventy-five. As part of the Catholic Worker Movement, Day co-founded the \"Catholic Worker\" newspaper in 1933, and served as its editor from 1933 until her death in 1980. In this newspaper, Day advocated the Catholic economic theory of distributism, which she considered a third way between capitalism and socialism. \nPope Benedict XVI used her conversion story as an example of how to \"journey towards faith... in a secularized environment.\" Pope Francis included her in a short list of exemplary Americans, together with Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Thomas Merton, in his address before the United States Congress. The Church has opened the cause for Day's possible canonization, which was accepted by the Holy See for investigation. Due to this, the Church refers to her with the title of Servant of God.\n\nDorothy May Day was born on November 8, 1897, in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. She was born into a family described by one biographer as \"solid, patriotic, and middle class\". Her father, John Day, was a Tennessee native of Irish heritage, while her mother, Grace Satterlee, a native of upstate New York, was of English ancestry. Her parents were married in an Episcopal church in Greenwich Village. She had three brothers and a sister. In 1904, her father, who was a sports writer devoted to horse racing, took a position with a newspaper in San Francisco. The family lived in Oakland, California, until the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 destroyed the newspaper's facilities, and her father lost his job. From the spontaneous response to the earthquake's devastation, the self-sacrifice of neighbors in a time of crisis, Day drew a lesson about individual action and Christian community. The family relocated to Chicago.\n\nDay's parents were nominal Christians who rarely attended church. As a young child, she showed a marked religious streak, reading the Bible frequently. When she was ten she started to attend Church of Our Saviour, an Episcopal church in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, after its rector convinced her mother to let Day's brothers join the church choir. She was taken with the liturgy and its music. She studied the catechism and was baptized and confirmed in that church in 1911.\n\nDay was an avid reader in her teens, particularly fond of Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\". She worked from one book to another, noting Jack London's mention of Herbert Spencer in \"Martin Eden\", and then from Spencer to Darwin and Huxley. She learned about anarchy and extreme poverty from Peter Kropotkin, who promoted a belief in cooperation in contrast to Darwin's competition for survival. She also enjoyed Russian literature in university, especially Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Gorky. Day read a lot of socially conscious work, which gave her a background for her future; it helped bolster her support for and involvement in social activism.\n\nIn 1914, Day attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on a scholarship. She was a reluctant scholar. Her reading was chiefly in a Christian radical social direction. She avoided campus social life, and supported herself rather than rely on money from her father, buying all her clothing and shoes from discount stores. She left the university after two years, and moved to New York City.\n\nShe settled on the Lower East Side and worked on the staff of several Socialist publications, including \"The Liberator\", \"The Masses\", and \"The Call\". She \"smilingly explained to impatient socialists that she was 'a pacifist even in the class war.'\" Years later, Day described how she was pulled in different directions: \"I was only eighteen, so I wavered between my allegiance to Socialism, Syndicalism (the I.W.W.'s) and Anarchism. When I read Tolstoy I was an Anarchist. My allegiance to \"The Call\" kept me a Socialist, although a left-wing one, and my Americanism inclined me to the I.W.W. movement.\"\n\nShe celebrated the February Revolution in Russia in 1917, the overthrow of the monarchy and establishment of a reformist government. In November 1917, she was arrested for picketing at the White House on behalf of women's suffrage as part of a campaign called the Silent Sentinels organized by Alice Paul and the National Women's Party. Sentenced to 30 days in jail, she served 15 days before being released, ten of them on a hunger strike.\n\nShe spent several months in Greenwich Village, where she became close to Eugene O'Neill, whom she later credited with having produced \"an intensification of the religious sense that was in me\". She had a love affair of several years with Mike Gold, a radical writer who later became a prominent Communist. She maintained friendships with such prominent American Communists as Anna Louise Strong, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who became the head of the Communist Party USA.\n\nInitially Day lived a bohemian life. In February 1921, after ending an unhappy love affair with Lionel Moise, and having an abortion that was \"the great tragedy of her life,\" she married Berkeley Tobey in a civil ceremony. She spent the better part of a year with him in Europe, removed from politics, focusing on art and literature, and writing a semi-autobiographical novel, \"The Eleventh Virgin\" (1924), based on her affair with Moise. In its \"Epilogue,\" she tried to draw lessons about the status of women from her experience: \"I thought I was a free and emancipated young woman, and found out I wasn't at all ... [F]reedom is just a modernity gown, a new trapping that we women affect to capture the man we want.\" She later called it a \"very bad book.\" The sale of the movie rights to the novel gave her $2,500, and she bought a beach cottage as a writing retreat in Staten Island, New York. Soon she found a new lover, Forster Batterham, an activist and biologist, who joined her there on weekends. She lived there from 1925 to 1929, entertaining friends and enjoying a romantic relationship that foundered when she took passionately to motherhood and religion.\n\nDay, who had thought herself sterile following her abortion, was elated to find she was pregnant in mid-1925, while Batterham dreaded fatherhood. While she visited her mother in Florida, separating from Batterham for several months, she intensified her exploration of Catholicism. When she returned to Staten Island, Batterham found her increasing devotion, attendance at Mass, and religious reading incomprehensible. Soon after the birth of their daughter Tamar Teresa, on March 4, 1926, Day encountered a local Catholic Religious Sister, Sister Aloysia, S.C., and with her help educated herself in the Catholic faith, and had her baby baptized in July 1927. Batterham refused to attend the ceremony, and his relationship with Day became increasingly unbearable, as her desire for marriage in the Church confronted his antipathy to organized religion, Catholicism most of all. After one last fight in late December, Day refused to allow him to return. On December 28, she had herself baptized with Sister Aloysia as her godparent.\n\nIn the summer of 1929, to put the situation with Batterham behind her, Day accepted a job writing film dialogue for Pathé Motion Pictures, and moved to Los Angeles with Tamar. A few months later, following the 1929 stock market crash, her contract was not renewed. She returned to New York via a sojourn in Mexico, and a family visit in Florida. Day supported herself as a journalist, writing a gardening column for the local paper, the \"Staten Island Advance\", and features articles and book reviews for several Catholic publications, like \"Commonweal\".\n\nIt was during one of her assignments for The Commonweal in Washington, D.C. when she decided to take a greater role in social activism and Catholicism. During the hunger strikes in D.C. in December 1932, she noted that she was filled with pride watching the marchers, but she couldn't do much with her conversion. She writes in her autobiography: \"I could write, I could protest, to arouse the conscience, but where was the Catholic leadership in the gathering of bands of men and women together, for the actual works of mercy that the comrades had always made part of their technique in reaching the workers?\" Later, she visited the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in northeast D.C. to offer a prayer to find a way to use her gifts and talents to help her fellow workers and the poor.\n\nIn 1932, Day met Peter Maurin, the man she always credited as the founder of the movement with which she is identified. Maurin, a French immigrant and something of a vagabond, had entered the Brothers of the Christian Schools in his native France, before emigrating, first to Canada, then to the United States. Despite his lack of formal education, Maurin was a man of deep intellect and decidedly strong views. He had a vision of social justice and its connection with the poor, which was partly inspired by St. Francis of Assisi. He had a vision of action based on a sharing of ideas and subsequent action by the poor themselves. Maurin was deeply versed in the writings of the Church Fathers and the papal documents on social matters that had been issued by Pope Leo XIII and his successors. Maurin provided Day with the grounding in Catholic theology of the need for social action they both felt. Years later Day described how Maurin also broadened her knowledge by bringing \"a digest of the writings of Kropotkin one day, calling my attention especially to \"Fields, Factories, and Workshops\". Day observed: \"I was familiar with Kropotkin only through his \"Memoirs of a Revolutionist,\" which had originally run serially in the \"Atlantic Monthly.\" She wrote: \"Oh, far day of American freedom, when Karl Marx could write for the morning \"Tribune\" in New York, and Kropotkin could not only be published in the \"Atlantic,\" but be received as a guest into the homes of New England Unitarians, and in Jane Addams' Hull House in Chicago!\" The French models and literature Maurin drew to Day's attention are of particular interest.\n\nThe Catholic Worker movement started when the first issue of the \"Catholic Worker\" appeared on May 1, 1933, priced at one cent, and published continuously since then. It was aimed at those suffering the most in the depths of the Great Depression, \"those who think there is no hope for the future\", and announced to them that \"the Catholic Church has a social program...there are men of God who are working not only for their spiritual but for their material welfare.\" It accepted no advertising and did not pay its staff. Publication of the first issue was supported in part by a $1 donation from Sister Peter Claver, for whom a Catholic Worker house was later named.\n\nLike many newspapers of the day, including those for which Day had been writing, it was an unapologetic example of advocacy journalism. It provided coverage of strikes, explored working conditions, especially of women and black workers, and explicated papal teaching on social issues. Its viewpoint was partisan and stories were designed to move its readers to take action locally, for example, by patronizing laundries recommended by the Laundry Workers' Union. Its advocacy of federal child labor laws put it at odds with the American Church hierarchy from its first issue, but Day censored some of Maurin's attacks on the Church hierarchy and tried to have a collection of the paper's issues presented to Pope Pius XI in 1935.\n\nThe paper's principal competitor both in distribution and ideology was the Communist \"Daily Worker\". Day opposed its atheism, its advocacy of \"class hatred\" and violent revolution, and its opposition to private property. The first issue of the \"Catholic Worker\" asked: \"Is it not possible to be radical and not atheist?\" and celebrated its distribution in Union Square on May Day as a direct challenge to the Communists. Day defended government relief programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps that the Communists ridiculed. The \"Daily Worker\" responded by mocking the \"Catholic Worker\" for its charity work and for expressing sympathy for landlords when calling evictions morally wrong. In this fight, the Church hierarchy backed Day's movement and \"Commonweal\", a Catholic journal that expressed a wide range of viewpoints, said that Day's background positioned her well for her mission: \"There are few laymen in this country who are so completely conversant with Communist propaganda and its exponents.\"\n\nOver several decades, the \"Catholic Worker\" attracted such writers and editors as Michael Harrington, Ammon Hennacy, Thomas Merton, and Daniel Berrigan. From the publishing enterprise came a \"house of hospitality\", a shelter that provided food and clothing to the poor of the Lower East Side and then a series of farms for communal living. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States and to Canada and the United Kingdom. More than 30 independent but affiliated Catholic Worker communities had been founded by 1941.\n\nBeginning in 1935, the \"Catholic Worker\" began publishing articles that articulated a rigorous and uncompromising pacifist position, breaking with the traditional Catholic doctrine of just war theory. The next year, the two sides that fought the Spanish Civil War roughly approximated two of Day's allegiances, with the Church allied with Franco fighting radicals of many stripes, the \"Catholic\" and the \"worker\" at war with one another. Day refused to follow the Catholic hierarchy in support of Franco against the Republican forces, which were atheist and anticlerical in spirit, led by anarchists and communists (that is, the Republican forces were). She acknowledged the martyrdom of priests and nuns in Spain and said she expected the age of revolution she was living in to require more martyrs: \n\nThe paper's circulation fell as many Catholic churches, schools, and hospitals that had previously served as its distribution points withdrew support. Circulation fell from 150,000 to 30,000.\n\nIn 1938, she published an account of the transformation of her political activism into religiously motivated activism in \"From Union Square to Rome\". She recounted her life story selectively, without providing the details of her early years of \"grievous mortal sin\" when her life was \"pathetic little and mean\". She presented it as an answer to communist relatives and friends who have asked: \"How could you become a Catholic?\":\nThe Cardinal's Literature Committee of the New York Archdiocese recommended it to Catholic readers.\n\nIn the early 1940s she affiliated with the Benedictines, professing as an oblate of St. Procopius Abbey in 1955. This gave her a spiritual practice and connection that sustained her throughout the rest of her life. She was briefly a postulant in the Fraternity of Jesus Caritas, which was inspired by the example of Charles de Foucauld. Day felt unwelcome there and disagreed with how meetings were run. When she withdrew as a candidate for the Fraternity, she wrote to a friend: \"I just wanted to let you know that I feel even closer to it all, tho it is not possible for me to be a recognized 'Little Sister,' or formally a part of it\".\n\nDay reaffirmed her pacifism following the U.S. declaration of war in 1941 and urged noncooperation in a speech that day: \"We must make a start. We must renounce war as an instrument of policy. . . . Even as I speak to you I may be guilty of what some men call treason. But we must reject war. . . . You young men should refuse to take up arms. Young women tear down the patriotic posters. And all of you—young and old—put away your flags.\" Her January 1942 column was headlined \"We Continue Our Christian Pacifist Stand\". She wrote: \n\nThe circulation of the \"Catholic Worker\", following its losses during the Spanish Civil War, had risen to 75,000, but now plummeted again. The closing of many of the movement's houses around the country, as staff left to join the war effort, showed that Day's pacifism had limited appeal even within the Catholic Worker community.\n\nOn January 13, 1949, unions representing workers at cemeteries managed by the Archdiocese of New York went on strike. After several weeks, Cardinal Francis Spellman used lay brothers from the local Maryknoll seminary and then diocesan seminarians under his own supervision to break the strike by digging graves. He called the union action \"Communist-inspired\". Employees of the \"Catholic Worker\" joined the strikers' picket line, and Day wrote Spellman, telling him he was \"misinformed\" about the workers and their demands, defending their right to unionize and their \"dignity as men\", which she deemed far more important than any dispute about wages. She begged him to take the first steps to resolve the dispute: \"Go to them, conciliate them. It is easier for the great to give in than the poor.\" Spellman stood fast until the strike ended on March 11 when the union members accepted the Archdiocese's original offer of a 48-hour 6-day work week. Day wrote in the \"Catholic Worker\" in April: \"A Cardinal, ill-advised, exercised so overwhelming a show of force against the union of poor working men. There is a temptation of the devil to that most awful of all wars, the war between the clergy and the laity.\" Years later she explained her stance vis-à-vis Spellman: \"[H]e is our chief priest and confessor; he is our spiritual leader–of all of us who live here in New York. But he is not our ruler.\" On March 3, 1951, the Archdiocese ordered Day to cease publication or remove the word \"Catholic\" from the name of her publication. She replied with a respectful letter that asserted as much right to publish the \"Catholic Worker\" as the Catholic War Veterans had to their name and their own opinions independent of those of the Archdiocese. The Archdiocese took no action, and later Day speculated that perhaps church officials did not want members of the Catholic Worker movement holding prayer vigils for him to relent: \"We were ready to go to St. Patrick's, fill up the Church, stand outside it in prayerful meditation. We were ready to take advantage of America's freedoms so that we could say what we thought and do what we believed to be the right thing to do.\"\n\nHer autobiography, \"The Long Loneliness\", was published in 1952 with illustrations by the Quaker Fritz Eichenberg. \"The New York Times\" summarized it a few years later:\nOn June 15, 1955, Day joined a group of pacifists in refusing to participate in civil defense drills scheduled that day. Some of them challenged the constitutionality of the law under which they were charged, but Day and six others took the position that their refusal was not a legal dispute but one of philosophy. Day said she was doing \"public penance\" for the United States' first use of an atom bomb. They pleaded guilty on September 28, 1955, but the judge refused to send them to jail saying \"I'm not making any martyrs.\" She did the same in each of the next five years. In 1958, instead of taking shelter she joined a group picketing the offices of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. After some years, sentences were suspended, but once she served 30 days in jail.\n\nIn 1956, along with David Dellinger and A. J. Muste, two veteran allies in the pacifist movement, she helped found \"Liberation\" magazine.\n\nIn 1960, she praised Fidel Castro's \"promise of social justice\". She said: \"Far better to revolt violently than to do nothing about the poor destitute.\" Several months later, Day traveled to Cuba and reported her experiences in a four-part series in the \"Catholic Worker\". In the first of these, she wrote: \"I am most of all interested in the religious life of the people and so must not be on the side of a regime that favors the extirpation of religion. On the other hand, when that regime is bending all its efforts to make a good life for the people, a naturally good life (on which grace can build) one cannot help but be in favor of the measures taken.\"\n\nDay hoped that the Second Vatican Council would endorse nonviolence as a fundamental tenet of Catholic life and denounce nuclear arms, both their use in warfare and the \"idea of arms being used as deterrents, to establish a balance of terror\". She lobbied bishops in Rome and joined with other women in a ten-day fast. She was pleased when the Council in \"Gaudium et spes\" (1965), its statement on \"the Church in the Modern World\", said that nuclear warfare was incompatible with traditional Catholic just war theory: \"Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God and man, which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation.\"\n\nDay's account of the Catholic Worker movement, \"Loaves and Fishes\", was published in 1963.\n\nDespite her anti-establishment sympathies, Day's judgment of the 60s counterculture was nuanced. She enjoyed it when Abbie Hoffman told her she was the original hippie, accepting it as a form of tribute to her detachment from materialism. At the same time she disapproved of many who called themselves hippies. She described some she encountered in 1969 in Minnesota: \"They are marrying young–17 and 18, and taking to the woods up by the Canadian border and building houses for themselves–becoming pioneers again.\" But she recognized in them the self-indulgence of middle-class affluence, people who had \"not known suffering\" and lived without principles. She imagined how soldiers returning from Vietnam would want to kill them, but thought what the \"flower-people\" deserved was \"prayer and penance\". Day struggled as a leader with influence but without direct authority over the Catholic Worker houses, even the Tivoli Catholic Worker Farm that she visited regularly. She recorded her frustration in her diary: \"I have no power to control smoking of pot, for instance, or sexual promiscuity, or solitary sins.\"\n\nIn 1966, Spellman visited U.S. troops in Vietnam at Christmas, where he was reported as saying: \"This war in Vietnam is ... a war for civilization.\" Day authored a response in the January 1967 issue of the \"Catholic Worker\" that avoided direct criticism but cataloged all the war zones Spellman had visited over the years: \"It is not just Vietnam, it is South Africa, it is Nigeria, the Congo, Indonesia, all of Latin America.\" Visiting was \"a brave thing to do\", she wrote, and asked: \"But oh, God, what are all these Americans doing all over the world so far from our own shores?\"\n\nIn 1970, at the height of American participation in the Vietnam War, she described Ho Chi Minh as \"a man of vision, as a patriot, a rebel against foreign invaders\" while telling a story of a holiday gathering with relatives where one needs \"to find points of agreement and concordance, if possible, rather than the painful differences, religious and political.\"\n\nIn 1971, Day was awarded the Pacem in Terris Award of the Interracial Council of the Catholic Diocese of Davenport, Iowa. The University of Notre Dame awarded her its Laetare Medal in 1972.\n\nDespite suffering from poor health, Day visited India, where she met Mother Teresa and saw her work. In 1971, Day visited Poland, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania as part of a group of peace activists, with the financial support of Corliss Lamont, whom she described as a \"'pinko' millionaire who lived modestly and helped the Communist Party USA.\" She met with three members of the Writers' Union and defended Alexander Solzhenitsyn against charges that he had betrayed his country. Day informed her readers that:\n\nDay visited the Kremlin, and she reported: \"I was moved to see the names of the Americans, Ruthenberg and Bill Haywood, on the Kremlin Wall in Roman letters, and the name of Jack Reed (with whom I worked on the old \"Masses\"), in Cyrillac characters in a flower-covered grave\". Ruthenberg was C. E. Ruthenberg, founder of the Communist Party USA. Bill Haywood was a key figure in the IWW. Jack Reed was the journalist better known as John Reed, author of \"Ten Days That Shook the World\".\n\nIn 1972, the Jesuit magazine \"America\" marked her 75th birthday by devoting an entire issue to Day and the Catholic Worker movement. The editors wrote: \"By now, if one had to choose a single individual to symbolize the best in the aspiration and action of the American Catholic community during the last forty years, that one person would certainly be Dorothy Day.\"\n\nDay had supported the work of Cesar Chavez in organizing California farm laborers from the beginning of his campaign in the mid-1960s. She admired him for being motivated by religious inspiration and committed to nonviolence. In the summer of 1973, she joined Cesar Chavez in his campaign for farm laborers in the fields of California. She was arrested with other protesters for defying an injunction against picketing and spent ten days in jail.\n\nIn 1974, Boston's Paulist Center Community named her the first recipient of their Isaac Hecker Award, given to a person or group \"committed to building a more just and peaceful world\".\n\nDay made her last public appearance at the Eucharistic Congress held on August 6, 1976, in Philadelphia at a service honoring the U.S. Armed Forces on the Bicentennial of the United States. She spoke about reconciliation and penance, and castigated the organizers for failing to recognize that for peace activists August 6 is the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, an inappropriate day to honor the military.\n\nDay suffered a heart attack and died on November 29, 1980, at Maryhouse on East 3rd Street in Manhattan. Cardinal Terence Cooke greeted her funeral procession at the Church of the Nativity, the local parish church. Day was buried in the Cemetery of the Resurrection on Staten Island just a few blocks from the beachside cottage where she first became interested in Catholicism. Her gravestone is inscribed with the words \"Deo Gratias\". Day's daughter Tamar, the mother of nine children, was with her mother when she died, and she and her father joined the funeral procession and attended a later memorial Mass the cardinal celebrated at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Day and Batterham had remained lifelong friends.\n\nJudith Palache Gregory was Day's executor.\n\nDay's papers are housed at Marquette University along with many records of the Catholic Worker movement.\nThe \"Catholic Worker\" had a circulation of more than 100,000 for some years, and reported a circulation of under 30,000 in 2013.\n\nIn May 1983, a pastoral letter issued by the U.S.Conference of Catholic Bishops, \"The Challenge of Peace,\" noted her role in establishing non-violence as a Catholic principle: \"the nonviolent witness of such figures as Dorothy Day and Martin Luther King has had profound impact upon the life of the Church in the United States.\"\n\nAttempts to preserve the Staten Island beach bungalow at the Spanish Camp community where she lived for the last decade of her life failed in 2001.\n\nDay struggled to write about poverty most of her life. She admired America's efforts to take responsibility through the government, but ultimately felt that charitable works were personal decisions that needed the warmth of an individual.\n\nDay also denounced sins against the poor. She said that \"depriving the laborer\" was a deadly sin, using similar language to the Epistle of James in the Bible. She also said that advertising men were sinners (\"woe to that generation\") because they made the poor \"willing to sell [their] liberty and honor\" to satisfy \"paltry desires.\"\n\nIn the \"Catholic Worker\" in May 1951, Day wrote that Marx, Lenin, and Mao Tse-Tung \"were animated by the love of brother and this we must believe though their ends meant the seizure of power, and the building of mighty armies, the compulsion of concentration camps, the forced labor and torture and killing of tens of thousands, even millions.\" She used them as examples because she insisted that the belief that \"all men are brothers\" required the Catholic to find the humanity in everyone without exception. She explained that she understood the jarring impact of such an assertion: \nIn 1970, Day emulated Maurin when she wrote:\n\nDay encountered anarchism while studying in university. She read \"The Bomb\" by Frank Harris, a fictionalized biography of one of the Haymarket anarchists. She discussed anarchy and extreme poverty with Peter Kropotkin. After moving to New York, Day studied the anarchism of Emma Goldman and attended the Anarchists Ball at Webster Hall.\n\nDay was saddened by the executions of the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927. She wrote that when they died, \"All the nation mourned.\" As a Catholic, she felt a sense of solidarity with them, specifically \"the very sense of solidarity which made me gradually understand the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ whereby we are all members of one another.\"\n\nDiscussing the term \"anarchism\", she wrote: \"We ourselves have never hesitated to use the word. Some prefer personalism. But Peter Maurin came to me with Kropotkin in one pocket and St. Francis in the other!\"\n\nDorothy Day's anarchist distributist economic views are very similar to the anarchist Proudhon's mutualist economic theory whom she was influenced by. The influence of the anarchists Proudhon and Kropotkin also led her to label herself an anarchist. Dorothy Day states: \"An anarchist then as I am now, I have never used the vote that the women won by their demonstrations before the White House during that period.\".\n\nDay explained that anarchists accepted her as someone who shared the values of their movement \"[b]ecause I have been behind bars in police stations, houses of detention, jails and prison farms, ... eleven times, and have refused to pay Federal income taxes and have never voted\", but were puzzled by what they saw as her \"Faith in the monolithic, authoritarian Church\". She reversed the viewpoint and ignored their professions of atheism. She wrote: \"I in turn, can see Christ in them even though they deny Him, because they are giving themselves to working for a better social order for the wretched of the earth.\"\n\nIn the first years of the \"Catholic Worker\", Day provided a clear statement of how her individualism contrasted with communism:\nIn November 1949, in the course of explaining why she had protested the recent denial of bail to several Communists, she wrote: \"[L]et it be remembered that I speak as an ex-Communist and one who has not testified before Congressional Committees, nor written works on the Communist conspiracy. I can say with warmth that I loved the [communist] people I worked with and learned much from them. They helped me to find God in His poor, in His abandoned ones, as I had not found Him in Christian churches.\" She identified points on which she agreed with the communists: \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\" and the \"withering away of the State.\" Others she added with qualifications: \"the communal aspect of property as stressed by the early Christians\". And she identified differences: \"we disagree over and over again with the means chosen to reach their ends\". She agreed that \"Class war is a fact and one does not need to advocate it\", but posed the question of how to respond:\nIn regard to Fidel Castro's Cuba, she wrote in July 1961: \"We are on the side of the revolution. We believe there must be new concepts of property, which is proper to man, and that the new concept is not so new. There is a Christian communism and a Christian capitalism... We believe in farming communes and cooperatives and will be happy to see how they work out in Cuba... God bless Castro and all those who are seeing Christ in the poor. God bless all those who are seeking the brotherhood of man because in loving their brothers they love God even though they deny Him.\" It was only in December 1961 that Castro, who had repeatedly repudiated communism in the past, openly declared that his movement was not simply socialist, but communist.\n\nBill Kauffman of \"The American Conservative\" wrote of Day: \"The Little Way. That is what we seek. That—contrary to the ethic of personal parking spaces, of the dollar-sign god—is the American way. Dorothy Day kept to that little way, and that is why we honor her. She understood that if small is not always beautiful, at least it is always human.\"\n\nDay's belief in smallness also applied to the property of others, including the Catholic Church, as when she wrote: \"Fortunately, the Papal States were wrested from the Church in the last century, but there is still the problem of investment of papal funds. It is always a cheering thought to me that if we have good will and are still unable to find remedies for the economic abuses of our time, in our family, our parish, and the mighty church as a whole, God will take matters in hand and do the job for us. When I saw the Garibaldi mountains in British Columbia . . . I said a prayer for his soul and blessed him for being the instrument of so mighty a work of God. May God use us!\"\n\nJesuit priest Daniel Lyons \"called Day 'an apostle of pious oversimplification.' He said that the \"Catholic Worker\" 'often distorted beyond recognition' the position of the Popes\".\n\nDay wrote in one of her memoirs: \"I had a conversation with John Spivak, the Communist writer, a few years ago, and he said to me, \"How can you believe? How can you believe in the Immaculate Conception, in the Virgin birth, in the Resurrection?\" I could only say that I believe in the Roman Catholic Church and all she teaches. I have accepted Her authority with my whole heart. At the same time I want to point out to you that we are taught to pray for final perseverance. We are taught that faith is a gift, and sometimes I wonder why some have it and some do not. I feel my own unworthiness and can never be grateful enough to God for His gift of faith.\"\n\nDay's commitment to Church teaching is illustrated by an encounter she had with Fr. Daniel Berrigan, S.J. while on a Catholic Worker farm in New York. Berrigan was about to say Mass for the community vested only in a stole. Day insisted that he put on the proper vestments before he began. When Berrigan fussed about the foolishness of the law regarding liturgical attire, Day responded, \"On this farm, we obey the laws of the Church.\" He relented and said the Mass fully vested.\n\nIn response to press coverage in 1964 of an ongoing dispute between Cardinal James McIntyre of Los Angeles and some of his priests, who criticized him for a lack of leadership on civil rights, Day authored an essay on the laity's responsibility to act independently of the church hierarchy. When the \"Catholic Worker\" during World War II, she wrote, took a pacifist stance, \"Bishop McIntyre merely commented ... 'We never studied these things much in the seminary' ... adding doubtfully, 'There is the necessity of course to inform one's conscience.' \" For that attitude, Day added, \"our shepherds are to be reproached, that they have not fed their sheep these strong meats ... capable of overcoming all obstacles in their advance to that kind of society where it easier to be good.\" She instructed her readers: \"Let Catholics form their associations, hold their meetings in their own homes, or in a hired hall, or any place else. Nothing should stop them. Let the controversy come out into the open in this way.\"\n\nIn September 1963, Day discussed pre-marital sex in her column, warning against those who portrayed it as a form of freedom: \"The wisdom of the flesh is treacherous indeed.\" She described herself as \"a woman who must think in terms of the family, the need of the child to have both mother and father, who believes strongly that the home is the unit of society\" and wrote that: \n\nIn 1968, Day wrote again about sex—this time in her diary—in response to the criticisms of Stanley Vishnewski (and other coworkers at the Tivoli farm) that she had \"no power\" over marijuana smoking \"or sexual promiscuity, or solitary sins.\" The situation continued to remain a problem, as Day also documented in her diary:\n\nA proposal for Day's canonization was put forth publicly by the Claretian Missionaries in 1983. At the request of Cardinal John J. O'Connor, head of the diocese in which she lived, in March 2000 Pope John Paul II granted the Archdiocese of New York permission to open her cause, allowing her to be called a \"Servant of God\" in the eyes of the Catholic Church. As canon law requires, the Archdiocese of New York submitted this cause for the endorsement of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which it received in November 2012. Some members of the Catholic Worker Movement objected to the canonization process as a contradiction of Day's own values and concerns.\n\nPope Benedict XVI, on February 13, 2013, in the closing days of his papacy, cited Day as an example of conversion. He quoted from her writings and said: \"The journey towards faith in such a secularized environment was particularly difficult, but Grace acts nonetheless.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10624207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10624207", "title": "Ego integrity", "text": "Ego integrity\n\nEgo integrity was the term given by Erik Erikson to the last of his eight stages of psychosocial development, and used by him to represent 'a post-narcissistic love of the human ego—as an experience which conveys some world order and spiritual sense, no matter how dearly paid for'.\n\nIntegrity of the ego can also be used with respect to the development of a reliable sense of self, a reliable sense of other, and an understanding of how those constructs interact to form a person's experience of reality; as well as to the way 'the synthetic function of the ego, though it is of such extraordinary importance, is subject...to a whole number of disturbances'.\n\nErikson wrote that 'for the fruit of these seven stages I know no better word than ego integrity...the ego's accrued assurance of its proclivity for order and meaning'. Erikson considered that 'if vigor of mind combines with the \"gift of responsible renunciation\", some old people can envisage human problems in their entirety...a living example of the \"closure\" of a style of life'. \n\nThe opposite of ego integrity was despair, as 'signified by fear of death: the one and only life cycle is not accepted as the ultimate of life. Despair expresses the feeling that the time is now too short...to try out alternative roads to integrity'.\n\n'Erikson's hypothesis that maturity involves working through a conflict between integrity and despair over past accomplishments' has received some empirical support: on one measure, 'the resolution of past life stages was more predictive of ego integrity than were other personality variables'.\n\nGail Sheehy termed the later stage of 'Second Adulthood...\"Age of Integrity\" (65-85+)'.\n\nThe ninth of Loevinger's stages of ego development was the ' \"Integrated Stage\"...and ego integrity versus despair are probably Erikson's version of the Integrated Stage'.\n\nIn his structural theory, Sigmund Freud described the ego as the mediator between the id and super-ego and the external world. The task of the ego is to find a balance between primitive drives, morals, and reality, while simultaneously satisfying the id and superego. Freudians saw the ego as forming from separate \"nuclei\": 'A final ego is formed by synthetic integration of these nuclei, and in certain states of ego regression a split of the ego into its original nuclei becomes observable'.\n\nThe main concern of the ego is with safety, ideally only allowing the id's desires to be expressed when the consequences are marginal. Ego defenses are often employed by the ego when id behaviour conflicts with reality and either society's morals, norms, and taboos, or an individual's internalization of these morals, norms, and taboos. Freud noted however that in the face of conflicts with superego or id, it was always 'possible for the ego to avoid a rupture by submitting to encroachments on its own unity and even perhaps by effecting a cleavage or division of itself'. In a late, unfinished paper he examined how sometimes 'the instinct is allowed to retain its satisfaction and proper respect is shown to reality...at the price of a rift in the ego which never heals but increases as time goes on...a splitting of the ego'. Lacan would develop this line of thought, and maintain indeed that 'it is in the disintegration of the imaginary unity constituted by the ego that the subject finds the signifying material of his symptoms'.\n\nFrom another standpoint, Object relations theory has explored 'the encounter with the \"other\" that threatens the ego's integrity', as when the object in question is lacking in 'its expected function as \"container\" of excitations'.\n\nThe word ego is taken directly from Latin where it is the nominative of the first person singular personal pronoun and is translated as \"I myself\" to express emphasis—it is a translation of Freud's German term \"Das Ich\", which in English would be \"the I\".\n\n'In Cicero's \"De Senectute\"...old age acquires a meaning identified with the achievement of total self-possession, ego-integrity, and wisdom...Erikson's own psychology, on its normative side, is finally only a restatement of Stoic ideals'.\n\nIn his late haiku, 'we see Issa the old man—hundreds of years, thousands of years old, the Old Man of Edward Lear. That is our fate too. We have to die, to become nothing, in order to know the meaning of something'.\n\n"}
{"id": "12835695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12835695", "title": "Emotionally focused therapy", "text": "Emotionally focused therapy\n\nEmotionally focused therapy and emotion-focused therapy (EFT) are a family of related approaches to psychotherapy with individuals, couples, or families. EFT approaches include elements of experiential therapy (such as person-centered therapy and Gestalt therapy), systemic therapy, and attachment theory. EFT is usually a short-term treatment (8–20 sessions). EFT approaches are based on the premise that human emotions are connected to human needs, and therefore emotions have an innately adaptive potential that, if activated and worked through, can help people change problematic emotional states and interpersonal relationships. \"Emotion-focused therapy\" for individuals was originally known as process-experiential therapy, and it is still sometimes called by that name.\n\nEFT should not be confused with \"emotion-focused coping\", a category of coping proposed by some psychologists, although clinicians have used EFT to help improve clients' emotion-focused coping.\n\nEFT began in the mid-1980s as an approach to helping couples. EFT was originally formulated and tested by Sue Johnson and Les Greenberg in 1985, and the first manual for emotionally focused couples therapy was published in 1988.\n\nTo develop the approach, Johnson and Greenberg began reviewing videos of sessions of couples therapy to identify, through observation and task analysis, the elements that lead to positive change. They were influenced in their observations by the humanistic experiential psychotherapies of Carl Rogers and Fritz Perls, both of whom valued (in different ways) present-moment emotional experience for its power to create meaning and guide behavior. Johnson and Greenberg saw the need to combine experiential therapy with the systems theoretical view that meaning-making and behavior cannot be considered outside of the whole situation in which they occur. In this \"experiential–systemic\" approach to couples therapy, as in other approaches to systemic therapy, the problem is viewed as belonging not to one partner, but rather to the cyclical reinforcing patterns of interactions between partners. Emotion is viewed not only as a within-individual phenomena, but also as part of the whole system that organizes the interactions between partners.\n\nIn 1986, Greenberg chose \"to refocus his efforts on developing and studying an experiential approach to individual therapy\". Greenberg and colleagues shifted their attention away from couples therapy toward individual psychotherapy. They attended to emotional experiencing and its role in individual self-organization. Building on the experiential theories of Rogers and Perls and others such as Eugene Gendlin, as well as on their own extensive work on information processing and the adaptive role of emotion in human functioning, created a treatment manual with numerous clearly outlined principles for what they called a \"process-experiential\" approach to psychological change. and have further expanded the process-experiential approach, with detailed manuals of specific methods of therapeutic intervention. presents case formulation maps for this approach.\n\nJohnson continued to develop EFT for couples, integrating attachment theory with systemic and humanistic approaches, and explicitly expanding attachment theory's understanding of love relationships. Johnson's model retained the original three stages and nine steps and two sets of interventions that aim to reshape the attachment bond: one set of interventions to track and restructure patterns of interaction and one to access and reprocess emotion (see below). Johnson's goal is the creation of positive cycles of interpersonal interaction wherein individuals are able to ask for and offer comfort and support to safe others, facilitating interpersonal emotion regulation.\n\nThe terms \"emotion-focused therapy\" and \"emotionally focused therapy\" have different meanings for different therapists.\n\nIn Les Greenberg's approach the term \"emotion-focused\" is sometimes used to refer to psychotherapy approaches in general that emphasize emotion. Greenberg \"decided that on the basis of the development in emotion theory that treatments such as the process experiential approach, as well as some other approaches that emphasized emotion as the target of change, were sufficiently similar to each other and different from existing approaches to merit being grouped under the general title of emotion-focused approaches.\" He and colleague Rhonda Goldman noted their choice to \"use the more American phrasing of \"emotion-focused\" to refer to therapeutic approaches that focused on emotion, rather than the original, possibly more English term (reflecting both Greenberg's and Johnson's backgrounds) \"emotionally focused\".\" Greenberg uses the term \"emotion-focused\" to suggest assimilative integration of an emotional focus into any approach to psychotherapy. He considers the focus on emotions to be a common factor among various systems of psychotherapy: \"The term \"emotion-focused therapy\" will, I believe, be used in the future, in its integrative sense, to characterize all therapies that are emotion-focused, be they psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, systemic, or humanistic.\" Greenberg co-authored a chapter on the importance of research by clinicians and integration of psychotherapy approaches that stated:\n\nIn addition to these empirical findings, leaders of major orientations have voiced serious criticisms of their preferred theoretical approaches, while encouraging an open-minded attitude toward other orientations... Furthermore, clinicians of different orientations recognized that their approaches did not provide them with the clinical repertoire sufficient to address the diversity of clients and their presenting problems.\n\nSue Johnson's use of the term \"emotionally focused therapy\" refers to a specific model of relationship therapy that explicitly integrates systems and experiential approaches and places prominence upon attachment theory as a theory of emotion regulation. Johnson views attachment needs as a primary motivational system for mammalian survival; her approach to EFT focuses on attachment theory as a theory of adult love wherein attachment, caregiving, and sex are intertwined. Attachment theory is seen to subsume the search for personal autonomy, dependability of the other and a sense of personal and interpersonal attractiveness, lovability and desire. Johnson's approach to EFT aims to reshape attachment strategies towards optimal interdependency and emotion regulation, for resilience and physical, emotional, and relational health.\n\nAll EFT approaches have retained emphasis on the importance of Rogerian empathic attunement and communicated understanding. They all focus upon the value of engaging clients in emotional experiencing moment-to-moment in session. Thus, an experiential focus is prominent in all EFT approaches. All EFT theorists have expressed the view that individuals engage with others on the basis of their emotions, and construct a sense of self from the drama of repeated emotionally laden interactions.\n\nThe information-processing theory of emotion and emotional appraisal (in accordance with emotion theorists such as Magda B. Arnold, Paul Ekman, Nico Frijda, and James Gross) and the humanistic, experiential emphasis on moment-to-moment emotional expression (developing the earlier psychotherapy approaches of Carl Rogers, Fritz Perls, and Eugene Gendlin) have been strong components of all EFT approaches since their inception. EFT approaches value emotion as the target and agent of change, honoring the intersection of emotion, cognition, and behavior. EFT approaches posit that emotion is the first, often subconscious response to experience. All EFT approaches also use the framework of primary and secondary (reactive) emotion responses.\n\nGreenberg and some other EFT theorists have categorized emotion responses into four types (see below) to help therapists decide how to respond to a client at a particular time: \"primary adaptive\", \"primary maladaptive\", \"secondary reactive\", and \"instrumental\". Greenberg has posited six principles of emotion processing: (1) awareness of emotion or naming what one feels, (2) emotional expression, (3) regulation of emotion, (4) reflection on experience, (5) transformation of emotion by emotion, and (6) corrective experience of emotion through new lived experiences in therapy and in the world. While primary adaptive emotion responses are seen as a reliable guide for behavior in the present situation, primary maladaptive emotion responses are seen as an unreliable guide for behavior in the present situation (alongside other possible emotional difficulties such as lack of emotional awareness, emotion dysregulation, and problems in meaning-making).\n\nJohnson rarely distinguishes between adaptive and maladaptive primary emotion responses, and rarely distinguishes emotion responses as dysfunctional or functional. Instead, primary emotional responses are usually construed as normal survival reactions in the face of what John Bowlby called \"separation distress\". EFT for couples, like other systemic therapies that emphasize interpersonal relationships, presumes that the patterns of interpersonal interaction are the problematic or dysfunctional element. The patterns of interaction are amenable to change after accessing the underlying primary emotion responses that are subconsciously driving the ineffective, negative reinforcing cycles of interaction. Validating reactive emotion responses and reprocessing newly accessed primary emotion responses is part of the change process.\n\n proposed a 14-step case formulation process that regards emotion-related problems as stemming from at least four different possible causes: lack of awareness or avoidance of emotion, dysregulation of emotion, maladaptive emotion response, or a problem with making meaning of experiences. The theory features four types of emotion response (see below), categorizes needs under \"attachment\" and \"identity\", specifies four types of emotional processing difficulties, delineates different types of empathy, has at least a dozen different \"task markers\" (see below), relies on two interactive tracks of emotion and narrative processes as sources of information about a client, and presumes a dialectical-constructivist model of psychological development and an \"emotion schematic system\".\n\nThe emotion schematic system is seen as the central catalyst of self-organization, often at the base of dysfunction and ultimately the road to cure. For simplicity, we use the term \"emotion schematic process\" to refer to the complex synthesis process in which a number of coactivated emotion schemes coapply, to produce a unified sense of self in relation to the world.\n\nTechniques used in \"coaching clients to work through their feelings\" may include the Gestalt therapy empty chair technique, frequently used for resolving \"unfinished business\", and the two-chair technique, frequently used for self-critical splits.\n\nEmotion-focused theorists have posited that each person's emotions are organized into idiosyncratic \"emotion schemes\" that are highly variable both between people and within the same person over time, but for practical purposes emotional responses can be classified into four broad types: \"primary adaptive\", \"primary maladaptive\", \"secondary reactive\", and \"instrumental\".\n\n\nEmotion-focused theorists have proposed that each type of emotion response calls for a different intervention process by the therapist. Primary adaptive emotion responses need be more fully allowed and accessed for their adaptive information. Primary maladaptive emotion responses need to be accessed and explored to help the client identify core unmet needs (e.g., for validation, safety, or connection), and then regulated and transformed with new experiences and new adaptive emotions. Secondary reactive emotion responses need empathic exploration in order to discover the sequence of emotions that preceded them. Instrumental emotion responses need to be explored interpersonally in the therapeutic relationship to increase awareness of them and address how they are functioning in the client's situation.\n\nIt is important to note that primary emotion responses are not called \"primary\" because they are somehow more real than the other responses; all of the responses feel real to a person, but therapists can classify them into these four types in order to help clarify the functions of the response in the client's situation and how to intervene appropriately.\n\nA therapeutic task is an immediate problem that a client needs to resolve in a psychotherapy session. In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers such as Laura North Rice (a former colleague of Carl Rogers) applied task analysis to transcripts of psychotherapy sessions in an attempt to describe in more detail the process of clients' cognitive and emotional change, so that therapists might more reliably provide optimal conditions for change. This kind of psychotherapy process research eventually led to a standardized (and evolving) set of therapeutic tasks in emotion-focused therapy for individuals.\n\nThe following table summarizes the standard set of these therapeutic tasks as of 2012. The tasks are classified into five broad groups: empathy-based, relational, experiencing, reprocessing, and action. The \"task marker\" is an observable sign that a client may be ready to work on the associated task. The \"intervention process\" is a sequence of actions carried out by therapist and client in working on the task. The \"end state\" is the desired resolution of the immediate problem.\n\nIn addition to the task markers listed below, other markers and intervention processes for working with emotion and narrative have been specified: \"same old stories\", \"empty stories\", \"unstoried emotions\", and \"broken stories\".\n\nThe interventions and the structure of emotion-focused therapy have been adapted for the specific needs of psychological trauma survivors. A manual of emotion-focused therapy for individuals with complex trauma (EFTT) has been published. For example, modifications of the traditional Gestalt empty chair technique have been developed.\n\n proposed an emotionally focused approach to individual therapy that focuses on attachment, while integrating the experiential focus of empathic attunement for engaging and reprocessing emotional experience and tracking and restructuring the systemic aspects and patterns of emotion regulation. The therapist follows the attachment model by addressing deactivating and hyperactivating strategies. Individual therapy is seen as a process of developing secure connections between therapist and client, between client and past and present relationships, and within the client. Attachment principles guide therapy in the following ways: forming the collaborative therapeutic relationship, shaping the overall goal for therapy to be that of \"effective dependency\" (following John Bowlby) upon one or two safe others, depathologizing emotion by normalizing separation distress responses, and shaping change processes. The change processes are: identifying and strengthening patterns of emotion regulation, and creating corrective emotional experiences to transform negative patterns into secure bonds.\n\nA systemic perspective is important in all approaches to EFT for couples. Tracking conflictual patterns of interaction, often referred to as a \"dance\" in Johnson's popular literature, has been a hallmark of the first stage of Johnson and Greenberg's approach since its inception in 1985. In Goldman and Greenberg's newer approach, therapists help clients \"also work toward self-change and the resolution of pain stemming from unmet childhood needs that affect the couple interaction, in addition to working on interactional change.\" Goldman and Greenberg justify their added emphasis on self-change by noting that not all problems in a relationship can be solved only by tracking and changing patterns of interaction:\n\nIn addition, in our observations of psychotherapeutic work with couples, we have found that problems or difficulties that can be traced to core identity concerns such as needs for validation or a sense of worth are often best healed through therapeutic methods directed toward the self rather than to the interactions. For example, if a person's core emotion is one of shame and they feel \"rotten at the core\" or \"simply fundamentally flawed,\" soothing or reassuring from one's partner, while helpful, will not ultimately solve the problem, lead to structural emotional change, or alter the view of oneself.\n\nIn Greenberg and Goldman's approach to EFT for couples, although they \"fully endorse\" the importance of attachment, attachment is not considered to be the only interpersonal motivation of couples; instead, attachment is considered to be one of three aspects of relational functioning, along with issues of identity/power and attraction/liking. In Johnson's approach, attachment theory is considered to be the defining theory of adult love, subsuming other motivations, and it guides the therapist in processing and reprocessing emotion.\n\nIn Greenberg and Goldman's approach, the emphasis is on working with core issues related to identity (working models of self and other) and promoting both self-soothing and other-soothing for a better relationship, in addition to interactional change. In Johnson's approach, the primary goal is to reshape attachment bonds and create \"effective dependency\" (including secure attachment).\n\nEFT for couples features a nine-step model of restructuring the attachment bond between partners. In this approach, the aim is to reshape the attachment bond and create more effective co-regulation and \"effective dependency\", increasing individuals' self-regulation and resilience. In good-outcome cases, the couple is helped to respond and thereby meet each other's unmet needs and injuries from childhood. The newly shaped secure attachment bond may become the best antidote to traumatic experience from within and outside of the relationship.\n\nAdding to the original three-stage, nine-step EFT framework developed by Johnson and Greenberg, Greenberg and Goldman's emotion-focused therapy for couples has five stages and 14 steps. It is structured to work on identity issues and self-regulation prior to changing negative interactions. It is considered necessary, in this approach, to help partners experience and reveal their own underlying vulnerable feelings first, so they are better equipped to do the intense work of attuning to the other partner and to be open to restructuring interactions and the attachment bond.\n\n\nDuring this stage the therapist creates a comfortable and stable environment for the couple to have an open discussion about any hesitations the couples may have about the therapy, including the trustworthiness of the therapist. The therapist also gets a sense of the couple's positive and negative interactions from past and present and is able to summarize and present the negative patterns for them. Partners soon no longer view themselves as victims of their negative interaction cycle; they are now allies against it.\n\n\nThis stage involves restructuring and widening the emotional experiences of the couple. This is done through couples recognizing their attachment needs, and then changing their interactions based on those needs. At first their new way of interacting may be strange and hard to accept, but as they become more aware and in control of their interactions they are able to stop old patterns of behavior from reemerging.\n\n\nThis stage focuses on reflection of new emotional experiences and self-concepts. It integrates the couple's new ways of dealing with problems within themselves and in the relationship.\n\n described four attachment styles that affect the therapy process:\n\nThe emotionally focused family therapy (EFFT) of Johnson and her colleagues aims to promote secure bonds among distressed family members. It is a therapy approach consistent with the attachment-oriented experiential–systemic emotionally focused model in three stages: (1) de-escalating negative cycles of interaction that amplify conflict and insecure connections between parents and children; (2) restructuring interactions to shape positive cycles of parental accessibility and responsiveness to offer the child or adolescent a safe haven and a secure base; (3) consolidation of the new responsive cycles and secure bonds. Its primary focus is on strengthening parental responsiveness and caregiving, to meet children and adolescents' attachment needs. It aims to \"build stronger families through (1) recruiting and strengthening parental emotional responsiveness to children, (2) accessing and clarifying children's attachment needs, and (3) facilitating and shaping caregiving interactions from parent to child\". Some clinicians have integrated EFFT with play therapy.\n\nOne group of clinicians, inspired in part by Greenberg's approach to EFT, developed a treatment protocol specifically for families of individuals struggling with an eating disorder. The treatment is based on the principles and techniques of four different approaches: emotion-focused therapy, behavioral family therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, and the New Maudsley family skills-based approach. It aims to help parents \"support their child in the processing of emotions, increasing their emotional self-efficacy, deepening the parent–child relationships and thereby making ED [eating disorder] symptoms unnecessary to cope with painful emotional experiences\". The treatment has three main domains of intervention, four core principles, and five steps derived from Greenberg's emotion-focused approach and influenced by John Gottman: (1) attending to the child's emotional experience, (2) naming the emotions, (3) validating the emotional experience, (4) meeting the emotional need, and (5) helping the child to move through the emotional experience, problem solving if necessary.\n\nJohnson, Greenberg, and many of their colleagues have spent their long careers as academic researchers publishing the results of empirical studies of various forms of EFT.\n\nThe American Psychological Association considers emotion-focused therapy for individuals to be an empirically supported treatment for depression. Studies have suggested that it is effective in the treatment of depression, interpersonal problems, trauma, and avoidant personality disorder.\n\nPractitioners of EFT have claimed that studies have consistently shown clinically significant improvement post therapy. Studies, again mostly by EFT practitioners, have suggested that emotionally focused therapy for couples is an effective way to restructure distressed couple relationships into safe and secure bonds with long-lasting results. conducted a meta-analysis of the four most rigorous outcome studies before 2000 and concluded that the original nine-step, three-stage emotionally focused therapy approach to couples therapy had a larger effect size than any other couple intervention had achieved to date, but this meta-analysis was later harshly criticized by psychologist James C. Coyne, who called it \"a poor quality meta-analysis of what should have been left as pilot studies conducted by promoters of a therapy in their own lab\". A study with an fMRI component suggested that emotionally focused couples therapy reduces the brain's response to threat in the presence of a romantic partner, but this study too was later harshly criticized by Coyne.\n\nSome of the strengths of EFT approaches can be summarized as follows:\n\nPsychotherapist Campbell Purton, in his 2014 book \"The Trouble with Psychotherapy\", criticized a variety of approaches to psychotherapy, including behavior therapy, person-centered therapy, psychodynamic therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, emotion-focused therapy, and existential therapy; he argued that these psychotherapies have accumulated excessive and/or flawed theoretical baggage that deviates too much from an everyday common-sense understanding of personal troubles. With regard to emotion-focused therapy, Purton argued that \"the effectiveness of each of the 'therapeutic tasks' can be understood without the theory\" and that what clients say \"is not well explained in terms of the interaction of emotion schemes; it is better explained in terms of the person's situation, their response to it, and their having learned the particular language in which they articulate their response.\"\n\nIn 2014, psychologist James C. Coyne criticized some EFT research for lack of rigor (for example, being underpowered and having high risk of bias), but he also noted that such problems are common in the field of psychotherapy research.\n\nIn a 2015 article in \"Behavioral and Brain Sciences\" on \"memory reconsolidation, emotional arousal and the process of change in psychotherapy\", Richard D. Lane and colleagues summarized a common claim in the literature on emotion-focused therapy that \"emotional arousal is a key ingredient in therapeutic change\" and that \"emotional arousal is critical to psychotherapeutic success\". In a response accompanying the article, Bruce Ecker and colleagues (creators of coherence therapy) disagreed with this claim and argued that the key ingredient in therapeutic change involving memory reconsolidation is not emotional arousal but instead a perceived mismatch between an expected pattern and an experienced pattern; they wrote:\n\nThe brain clearly does not require emotional arousal per se for inducing deconsolidation. That is a fundamental point. If the target learning happens to be emotional, then its reactivation (the first of the two required elements) of course entails an experience of that emotion, but the emotion itself does not inherently play a role in the mismatch that then deconsolidates the target learning, or in the new learning that then rewrites and erases the target learning (discussed at greater length in ). [...] The same considerations imply that \"changing emotion with emotion\" (stated three times by Lane et al.) inaccurately characterizes how learned responses change through reconsolidation. Mismatch consists most fundamentally of a direct, unmistakable perception that the world functions differently from one's learned model. \"Changing model with mismatch\" is the core phenomenology.\n\nOther responses to argued that their emotion-focused approach \"would be strengthened by the inclusion of predictions regarding additional factors that might influence treatment response, predictions for improving outcomes for non-responsive patients, and a discussion of how the proposed model might explain individual differences in vulnerability for mental health problems\", and that their model needed further development to account for the diversity of states called \"psychopathology\" and the relevant maintaining and worsening processes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A variety of authors have argued that a particular system is the \"end of history\" including Thomas More in \"Utopia\", Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx, Vladimir Solovyov, Alexandre Kojève and Francis Fukuyama in the 1992 book, \"The End of History and the Last Man\".\n\nThe concept of an end of history differs from ideas of an end of the world as expressed in various religions, which may forecast a complete destruction of the Earth or of life on Earth, and the end of the human race as we know it. The end of history instead proposes a state in which human life continues indefinitely into the future without any further major changes in society, system of governance, or economics.\n\nThe phrase, 'the end of history' was first used by French philosopher and mathematician Antoine Augustin Cournot in 1861 \"to refer to the end of the historical dynamic with the perfection of civil society\". \"Arnold Gehlen adopted it in 1952 and it has been taken up more recently by Heidegger and Vattimo\".\n\nThe formal development of an idea of an \"end of history\" is most closely associated with Hegel, although Hegel discussed the idea in ambiguous terms, making it unclear whether he thought such a thing was a certainty or a mere possibility.\n\nA postmodern understanding of the term differs in that \"The idea of an 'end of history' does not imply that nothing more will ever happen. Rather, what the postmodern sense of an end of history tends to signify is, in the words of contemporary historian Keith Jenkins, the idea that 'the peculiar ways in which the past was historicized (was conceptualized in modernist, linear and essentially metanarrative forms) has now come to an end of its productive life; the all-encompassing \"experiment of modernity\" ... is passing away into our postmodern condition'.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "857948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=857948", "title": "Generalized other", "text": "Generalized other\n\nThe generalized other is a concept introduced by George Herbert Mead into the social sciences, and used especially in the field of symbolic interactionism. It is the general notion that a person has of the common expectations that others have about actions and thoughts within a particular society, and thus serves to clarify their relation to the other as a representative member of a shared social system.\n\nAny time that an actor tries to imagine what is expected of them, they are taking on the perspective of the generalized other.\n\nMead's concept of the generalised other has been linked to Adam Smith's notion of the impartial spectator – itself rooted in the earlier thinking of Addison and Epictectus.\n\nAdam Smith wrote: \"We Conceive ourselves as acting in the presence of a person quite candid and equitable, of one who...is meerly a man in general, an impartial Spectator who considers our conduct with the same indifference with which we regard that of other people\".\n\nMead began by contrasting the experience of role-play and pretence in early childhood, in which one role simply gives way to a different one without any continuity, with that of the organised game: \"in the latter\", he stated, \"the child must have the attitude of all the others involved in that game\". He saw the organised game as vital for the formation of a mature sense of self, which can only be achieved by learning to respond to, and take on board, the others' attitudes toward the (changing) common undertakings they are involved in: i.e. the generalized other.\n\nMead argued that \"in the game we get an organized other, a generalized other, which is found in the nature of the child itself...in the case of such a social group as a ball team, the team is the generalized other in so far as it enters – as an organized process or social activity – into the experience of any one of the individual members of it\".\n\nBy seeing things from an anonymous perspective, that of the other, the child may eventually be able to visualize the intentions and expectations of others, and see him/herself from the point of view of groups of others – the viewpoint of the generalized other.\n\nThe attitude of the generalized other is the attitude of the larger community. According to Mead, the generalized other is the vehicle by which we are linked to society.\n\nArguably, a modern differentiated society contains as many generalized others as there are social groupings: as Mead put it, \"every individual member of any given human society, of course, belongs to a large number of such different functional groups\". The result is that everybody will articulate aspects of the range of socio-cultural values in their own way, taking on the perspectives of a set of generalized others in a unique synthesis.\n\nWith rising levels of socialisation and individuation, more and more people, and more and more aspects of the self come into play in the dialectic of self and generalized other.\n\nAs a concept, the generalised other is roughly equivalent to the idea of the Freudian superego. It has also been compared to Lacan's use of the Name of the Father, as the third party created by the presence of social convention, law, and language in all human interaction. It is also similar to Bakhtin's (Superaddressee) \"superaddressee\" presumed to receive and understand human communication.\n\n\n"}

These products are often repaired, refurbished and recycled by brokers, resellers or the original manufacturer. They are suitable for resale to customers as a lower cost alternative to buying new goods from standard distribution channels.\n\nThe term \"green market\" refers to the fact that the resold goods are put back into productive use, which is the most environmentally friendly use of used or discontinued products.\n\nAlthough the resale of green market goods sometimes competes with the original manufacturer, it also helps the manufacturer and the original end user by allowing the original end user to receive value for the product they no longer need and to use that value in purchasing new goods from the manufacturer.\n\nParts from green market goods are sometimes necessary for the maintenance of current products that are in need of replacement parts which are no longer available.\n\nManufacturers that produce products including computer, telecom equipment, technology equipment very often sell those products that equipment through distributors. Most distribution agreements require the distributor to resell the products strictly to end users. However, some distributors choose to resell those products to other resellers. In the late 1980s manufacturers labeled the resold products as \"grey market\".\n\nThere is nothing illegal about buying \"grey market\" products. In fact, the US Supreme Court has upheld that grey market products are legal for resale in the United States regardless of where they were produced or originally sold. The EU Supreme Court has similarly ruled that grey market products are legal for resale in the EU, provided that the equipment was originally sold by the manufacturer inside the EU.\n\nManufacturers created the term \"grey market\" in an effort to instill fear in customers that buying such equipment was somehow illegal in an effort to assure manufacturers that customers would only purchase buy directly from them.\n\nThe term \"grey market\" was chosen because of it similarity to the old term \"Black Market\" which refers to stolen and illegal products.\n\nPutting green market products into productive use or using the parts from green market products for repair is very cost effective and environmentally responsible. Replacing broken products with newer products has a negative effect on the environment and has been recognized as ecologically hazardous.\n\nElectronic equipment is made up of many precious materials including highly refined glass, gold, aluminum, silver, polymers, copper and brass. Electronic recycling companies have the ability to store, disassemble, separate and transport these materials to companies for reuse in manufacturing.

Such dumping may pollute soil and water with dangerous and non-biodegradable waste.\n\nReferences- The Association of Service and Computer Dealers International\n\nThe North American Association of Telecommunications Dealers\n\nhttp://www.ascdi.com\n"}
{"id": "13623185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13623185", "title": "Injection locking", "text": "Injection locking\n\nInjection locking and injection pulling are the frequency effects that can occur when a harmonic oscillator is disturbed by a second oscillator operating at a nearby frequency. When the coupling is strong enough and the frequencies near enough, the second oscillator can capture the first oscillator, causing it to have essentially identical frequency as the second. This is injection locking. When the second oscillator merely disturbs the first but does not capture it, the effect is called injection pulling. Injection locking and pulling effects are observed in numerous types of physical systems, however the terms are most often associated with electronic oscillators or laser resonators.\n\nInjection locking has been used in beneficial and clever ways in the design of early television sets and oscilloscopes, allowing the equipment to be synchronized to external signals at a relatively low cost. Injection locking has also been used in high performance frequency doubling circuits. However, injection locking and pulling, when unintended, can degrade the performance of phase locked loops and RF integrated circuits.\n\nInjection pulling and injection locking can be observed in numerous physical systems where pairs of oscillators are coupled together. Perhaps the first to document these effects was Christiaan Huygens, the inventor of the pendulum clock, who was surprised to note that two pendulum clocks which normally would keep slightly different time nonetheless became perfectly synchronized when hung from a common beam. Modern researchers have confirmed his suspicion that the pendulums were coupled by tiny back-and-forth vibrations in the wooden beam. The two clocks became injection locked to a common frequency.\nIn a modern-day voltage-controlled oscillator an injection-locking signal may override its low-frequency control voltage, resulting in loss of control. When intentionally employed, injection locking provides a means to significantly reduce power consumption and possibly reduce phase noise in comparison to other frequency synthesizer and PLL design techniques. In similar fashion, the frequency output of large lasers can be purified by injection locking them with high accuracy reference lasers (see injection seeder).\n\nAn injection-locked oscillator (ILO) is usually based on cross-coupled LC oscillator. It has been employed for frequency division or jitter reduction in PLL, with the input of pure sinusoidal waveform. It was employed in continuous mode clock and data recovery (CDR) or clock recovery to perform clock restoration from the aid of either preceding pulse generation circuit to convert non-return-to-zero (NRZ) data to pseudo-return-to-zero (PRZ) format or nonideal retiming circuit residing at the transmitter side to couple the clock signal into the data. Recently, the ILO was employed for burst mode clock recovery scheme.\n\nThe operation of ILO is based on the fact that the local oscillation can be locked to the frequency and phase of external injection signal under proper conditions.\n\nHigh-speed logic signals and their harmonics are potential threats to an oscillator. The leakage of these and other high frequency signals into an oscillator through a substrate concomitant with an unintended lock is unwanted injection locking.\n\nInjection locking can also provide a means of gain at a low power cost in certain applications.\n\nInjection (aka frequency) pulling occurs when an interfering frequency source disturbs an oscillator but is unable to injection lock it. The frequency of the oscillator is pulled towards the frequency source as can be seen in the spectrogram. The failure to lock may be due to insufficient coupling, or because the injection source frequency lies outside the locking window of the oscillator.\nEntrainment has been used to refer to the process of mode locking of coupled driven oscillators, which is the process whereby two interacting oscillating systems, which have different periods when they function independently, assume a common period. The two oscillators may fall into synchrony, but other phase relationships are also possible. The system with the greater frequency slows down, and the other speeds up.\n\nDutch physicist Christiaan Huygens, the inventor of the pendulum clock, introduced the concept after he noticed, in 1666, that the pendulums of two clocks mounted on a common board had synchronized, and subsequent experiments duplicated this phenomenon. He described this effect as \"odd sympathy\". The two pendulum clocks synchronized with their pendulums swinging in opposite directions, 180° out of phase, but in-phase states can also result. Entrainment occurs because small amounts of energy are transferred between the two systems when they are out of phase in such a way as to produce negative feedback. As they assume a more stable phase relationship, the amount of energy gradually reduces to zero. In the realm of physics, Huygens' observations are related to resonance and the resonant coupling of harmonic oscillators, which also gives rise to sympathetic vibrations.\n\nA 2002 study of Huygens' observations show that an antiphase stable oscillation was somewhat fortuitous, and that there are other possible stable solutions, including a \"death state\" where a clock stops running, depending on the strength of the coupling between the clocks.\n\nMode locking between driven oscillators can be easily demonstrated using mechanical metronomes on a common, easily movable surface. Such mode locking is important for many biological systems including the proper operation of pacemakers.\n\nThe use of the word entrainment in the modern Physics literature most often refers to the movement of one fluid, or collection of particulates, by another (see Entrainment (hydrodynamics)). The use of the word to refer to mode locking of non-linear coupled oscillators appears mostly after about 1980, and remains relatively rare in comparison.\n\nA similar coupling phenomenon was characterized in hearing aids when the adaptive feedback cancellation is used. This chaotic artifact (entrainment) is observed when correlated input signals are presented to an adaptive feedback canceller.\n\nIn recent years, aperiodic entrainment has been identified as an alternative form of entrainment that is of interest in biological rhythms.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43147750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43147750", "title": "Internet metaphors", "text": "Internet metaphors\n\nInternet metaphors provide users and researchers of the Internet a structure for understanding and communicating its various functions, uses, and experiences. An advantage of employing metaphors is that they permit individuals to visualize an abstract concept or phenomenon with which they have limited experience by comparing it with a concrete, well-understood concept such as physical movement through space. Metaphors to describe the Internet have been utilized since its creation and developed out of the need for the Internet to be understood by everyone when the goals and parameters of the Internet were still unclear. Metaphors helped to overcome the problems of the invisibility and intangibility of the Internet's infrastructure and to fill linguistic gaps where no literal expressions existed.\n\n\"Highways, webs, clouds, matrices, frontiers, railroads, tidal waves, libraries, shopping malls, and village squares are all examples of metaphors that have been used in discussions of the Internet.\" Over time these metaphors have become embedded in cultural communications, subconsciously shaping the cognitive frameworks and perceptions of users who guide the Internet's future development. Popular metaphors may also reflect the intentions of Internet designers or the views of government officials. Internet researchers tend to all agree that popular metaphors should be re-examined often to determine if they accurately reflect the realities of the Internet, but many disagree on which metaphors are worth keeping and which ones should be left behind.\n\nInternet metaphors guide future action and perception of the Internet's capabilities on an individual and societal level. Internet metaphors are contestable and sometimes may present political, educational, and cognitive issues. Tensions between producer and user, commercial and non-commercial interests, and uncertainty regarding privacy all influence the shape these metaphors take.\n\nCommon Internet metaphors such as the information superhighway are often criticized for failing to adequately reflect the reality of the Internet as they emphasize the speed of information transmission over the communal and relationship building aspects of the Internet. Internet researchers from a variety of disciplines are engaged in the analysis of metaphors across many domains in order to reveal their impact on user perception and determine which metaphors are best suited for conceptualizing the Internet. Results of this research have become the focus of a popular debate on \"which\" metaphors should be applied in political, educational, and commercial settings as well as which aspects of the Internet remain unaccounted for with current metaphors, limiting the scope of users understanding.\n\nMetaphors of the Internet often reveal the intentions of designers and industry spokespeople, \"For instance, those who use metaphors of consumption and shopping malls will devote resources to developing secure exchange mechanisms. Broadcasting metaphors carry with them assumptions about the nature of interactions between audiences and content providers that are more passive than those suggested by interactive game metaphors and applications. Computer security experts deploy metaphors that invoke fear, anxiety, and apocalyptic threat\" (Wyatt, 2004, p. 244). The extent to which the Internet is understood across individuals and groups determines their ability to navigate and build Web sites and social networks, attend online school, send e-mail, and a variety of other functions. Internet metaphors provide a comprehensive picture of the Internet as a whole as well as describe and explain the various tools, purposes, and protocols that regulate the use of these communication technologies.\n\nWithout the use of metaphors the concept of the Internet is abstract and its infrastructure difficult to comprehend. When it was introduced the Internet created a linguistic gap as no literal expressions existed to define its functions and properties. Internet metaphors arose out of this predicament so that it could be adequately described and explained to the public. Essentially all language now used to communicate about the Internet is of a metaphorical nature although users are often unaware of this reality because it is embedded in a cultural context that is widely accepted. There are several types of metaphors that serve various purposes and can range from describing the nature of online relationships, modeling the Internet visually, to the specific functions of the Internet as a tool. Each metaphor has implications for the experience and understanding of the Internet by its users and tends to emphasize some aspects of the Internet over others. Some metaphors emphasize space (Matlock, Castro, Fleming, Gann, & Maglio, 2014).\n\nCommon recurring themes regarding the Internet appear in popular media and reflect pervasive cultural attitudes and perceptions. Although other models and constructed metaphors of the Internet found in scholarly research and theoretical frameworks may be more accurate sources on the \"effects\" of the Internet, mass media messages in popular culture are more likely to influence how people think about and interact with the Internet.\n\nThe very first metaphor to describe the Internet was the World Wide Web proposed in 1989. However, uncertainty surrounding the structure and properties of the Internet was apparent in the newspapers of the 1990s that presented a vast array of contradicting visual models to explain the Internet. Spatial constructs were utilized to make the Internet appear as a tangible entity placed within a familiar geographical context. A popular metaphor adopted around the same time was cyberspace coined by William Gibson in his novel \"Neuromancer\" to describe the world of computers and the society that gathers around them.\n\nHoward Rheingold, an Internet enthusiast of the 1990s, propagated the metaphor of virtual communities and offered a vivid description of the Internet as \"...a place for conversation or publication, like a giant coffee-house with a thousand rooms; it is also a world-wide digital version of the Speaker's Corner in London's Hyde Park, an unedited collection of letters to the editor, a floating flea market, a huge vanity publisher, and a collection of every odd-special interest group in the world\" (Rheingold 1993, p. 130).\n\nIn 1991, Al Gore's choice to use the information superhighway as a metaphor shifted perceptions of the Internet as a communal enterprise to an economic model that emphasized the speed of information transmission. While this metaphor can still be found in popular culture, it has generally been dropped in favor of other metaphors due to its limited interpretation of other aspects of the Internet such as social networks. The most common types of metaphors in usage today relate to either social or functional aspects of the Internet or representations of its infrastructure through visual metaphors and models.\n\nInternet metaphors frequently arise from social exchanges and processes that occur online and incorporate common terms that describe offline social activities and realities. These metaphors often point to the fundamental elements that make up social interactions even though online interactions differ in significant ways from face-to-face communication. Therefore, social metaphors tend to communicate more about the values of society rather than the technology of the Internet itself.\n\nMetaphors such as the electronic neighborhood and virtual community point to ways in which individuals connect to others and build relationships by joining a social network. Global village is another metaphor that evokes the imagery of closeness and interconnectedness that might be found in a small village, but is applied to the worldwide community of Internet users. However, the global village metaphor has sometimes been criticized for suggesting that the \"entire\" world is connected by the Internet as the continued existence of social divides prevent many individuals from accessing the Internet.\n\nThe electronic frontier metaphor conceptualizes the Internet as a vast unexplored territory, a source of new resources, and a place to forge new social and business connections. Similar to the American ideology of the Western Frontier, the electronic frontier invokes the image of a better future to come through new opportunities afforded by the Internet. The Electronic Frontier Foundation is a non-profit digital rights group that adopted the use of this metaphor to denote their dedication to the protection of personal freedoms and fair use within the digital landscape. Social metaphors and their pervasive influence indicate the increasing importance placed on social interaction on the Internet.\n\nFunctional metaphors of the Internet shape our understanding of the medium itself and give us clues as to how we should actually use the Internet and interpret its infrastructure for design and policy making. These exist at the level of the Internet as a whole, at the level of a website, and the level of individual pages. The majority of these types of metaphors are based on the concept of various spaces and physical places, therefore, most are considered spatial metaphors. However, this aspect should not be considered the only defining feature of a functional metaphor as social metaphors are often spatial in nature.\n\nCyberspace is the most widely used spatial metaphor of the Internet and the implications of its use can be seen in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" definition, which denotes cyberspace as a space within whose boundaries digital communications take place. The implications of this spatial metaphor in discourse on law can be seen in instances where the application of traditional laws governing real property are applied to Internet spaces. However, arguments against this type of ruling have claimed that the Internet is a borderless space, which should not be subject to the laws applied to places. Others have argued that the Internet is in fact, a real space not sealed from the real world and can be zoned, trespassed upon, or divided up into holdings like real property. \n\nOther functional metaphors are based on travel within space such as \"surfing\" the Net and suggest the Internet is similar to an ocean. Web\"sites\" indicate components of a space, which are static and fixed, whereas, web\"pages\" suggest pages of a book. Similarly, focal points of the Internet structure are called nodes. Home pages, chat rooms, windows, and the idea that you can \"jump\" from one page to the next also invoke spatial imagery that guide the functions that users perform on the Internet. Other metaphors refer to the Internet as another dimension beyond typical spaces such as portals and gateways which refer to access and communication functions. Firewalls invoke the image of physically blocking the incoming of information such as viruses and pop-up ads.\n\nDesigners of computer systems often use spatial metaphors as a way of controlling the complexity of interfaces. Designers create actions, procedures, and concepts of systems based on similar actions, procedures, and concepts of other domains such as physical spaces so that they will be familiar to users. In designing hypertext, a system that links topics on a screen to related information, navigational metaphors such as landmarks, routes, and way-finding have often been implemented for users ease of understanding how hypertext functions.\n\nVisual metaphors are popular in conceptualizing the Internet and are often deployed in commercial promotions through visual media and imagery. The most common visual metaphor is a network of wires with nodes and route lines plotted on a geographically based map. However, maps of Internet infrastructure produced for network marketing are rarely based on actual pathways of wires and cable on the ground, but are instead based on circuit diagrams similar to those seen on subway maps. The globe, or the Earth viewed from space, with network arcs of data flow wrapped around it, is another dominant metaphor for the Internet in Western contexts and is connected with the metaphor of the Global Village. \n\nMany abstract visual metaphors based on organic structures and patterns are found in literature on the Internet's infrastructure. Often, these metaphors are used as a visual shorthand in explanations as they allow one to refer to the Internet as a definite object without having to explain the intricate details of its functioning. Clouds are the most common of abstract metaphors employed for this purpose in cloud computing and have been used since the creation of the Internet. Other abstract metaphors of the Internet draw on the fractal branching of trees and leaves, and the lattices of coral and webs, while others are based on the aesthetics of astronomy such as gas nebulas, and star clusters.\n\nTechnical methods such as algorithms are often used to create huge, complex graphs or maps of raw data from networks and the topology of connections. The typical result of this process are visual representations of the Internet that are elaborate and visually striking, resembling organic structures. These artistic, abstract representations of the Internet have been featured in art galleries, sold as wall posters, used on book covers, and have been claimed to be a picture of the \"whole\" Internet by many fans. However, there are no instructions on how these images may be interpreted. The main function of these representations has sometimes been explained as a metaphor for the complexity of the Internet. \n"}

Joy (in my sense) has indeed one characteristic, and one only, in common with them; the fact that anyone who has experienced it will want it again... I doubt whether anyone who has tasted it would ever, if both were in his power, exchange it for all the pleasures in the world. But then Joy is never in our power and Pleasure often is.\"\n\nThe causes of joy have been ascribed to various sources. “When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves.” Gautama Buddha, \"[Joy is] the emotional dimension of the good life, of a life that is both going well and is being lived well.\"Miroslav Volf, \"This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.\" George Bernard Shaw and “Find a place inside where there's joy, and the joy will burn out the pain.” Joseph Campbell.\n\n"}

{"id": "34600841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34600841", "title": "Marcellina (gnostic)", "text": "Marcellina (gnostic)\n\nMarcellina was an early Christian Carpocratian religious leader in the mid-second century AD known primarily from the writings of Irenaeus and Origen. She originated in Alexandria, but moved to Rome during the episcopate of Anicetus ( 157 – 168). She attracted large numbers of followers and founded the Carpocratian sect of Marcellians. Like other Carpocratians, Marcellina and her followers believed in antinomianism, also known as libertinism, the idea that obedience to laws and regulations is unnecessary in order to attain salvation. They believed that Jesus was only a man, but saw him as a model to be emulated, albeit one which a believer was capable of surpassing. Marcellina's community appears to have sought to literally implement the foundational Carpocratian teaching of social egalitarianism. The Marcellians in particular are reported to have branded their disciples on the insides of their right earlobes and venerated images of Jesus as well as Greek philosophers such as Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle. Although the Marcellians identified themselves as \"gnostics\", many modern scholars do not classify them as members of the sect of Gnosticism.\n\nWomen played prominent roles in many early Christians sects as prophets, teachers, healers, missionaries, and presbyters. Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany were female followers of Jesus who are mentioned in the gospels and were believed to know the \"mysteries\" of the kingdom of God. Women like Mary and Martha were the explicit role models for Marcellina and her fellow female preachers. A creed that may have been recited at Christian initiation ceremonies is quoted by the apostle Paul in : \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\" In the late first century, Marcion of Sinope ( 85 – 160) appointed women as presbyters on an equal basis as men.\n\nIn the second century, the Valentinians, a Gnostic sect, regarded women as equal to men. The Montanists regarded two prophetesses, Maximilla and Prisca, as the founders of their movement. Female religious leaders like Marcellina were not favored by orthodox theologians, who accused them of madness, unchastity, and demonic possession. The Church Father Tertullian ( 155 – 240) complained: \"These heretical women—how audacious they are! They have no modesty; they are bold enough to teach, to engage in argument, to enact exorcisms, to undertake cures, and, it may be, even to baptize!\" He denounced one female religious leader in North Africa as \"that viper\".\n\nAs a Carpocratian, Marcellina taught the doctrine of antinomianism, or libertinism, which holds that only faith and love are necessary to attain salvation and that all other perceived requirements, especially obedience to laws and regulations, are unnecessary. She, like other Carpocratians, believed that the soul must follow the path to redemption, possibly going through many incarnations. The goal of the believer is the escape from the cycle of reincarnation by ascending through several stages of deification. The Carpocratians believed that Jesus was only human, not divine, and saw him as a exemplary model to be followed, but an example which a particularly devout believer was capable of surpassing. Jesus's prime virtue was that he could perfectly remember the Divine from his pre-existence. They also venerated Greek philosophers as models to be emulated as well. The Marcellians' syncretic cult of images was a natural consequence of this teaching. One of the foundational teachings of the Carpocratians was the idea of social egalitarianism, which advocated equality for all people. Marcellina's position as the leader of the Carpocratian community in Rome indicates that, for her community at least, this was an idea which was meant to be literally implemented. Some Carpocratians, possibly including Marcellina, held all property in common and shared sexual partners. They also celebrated a form of agape feast.\n\nThe Church Father Irenaeus ( 130 – 202) records in his apologetic treatise \"Adversus Haereses\":\nOthers of them [i.e. the Carpocratians] employ outward marks, branding their disciples inside the lobe of the right ear. From among these also arose Marcellina, who came to Rome under [the episcopate of] Anicetus, and, holding these doctrines, she led multitudes astray. They style themselves Gnostics. They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles.\n\nMarcellina is the only woman associated with early Gnostic Christianity who is recorded to have been an active religious leader in her own right. Other women such as Helena (allegedly a former Tyrian prostitute turned muse of Simon Magus), Philumena (a prophetess associated with Apelles), and Flora (a student of Ptolemy) are known to have been active as prophetesses, teachers, and disciples involved in sects led by men, but none of them are known to have been leaders themselves. Nonetheless, Marcellina still appears in relation to Carpocrates, a male teacher, who appears to have been more actively involved than her in leading followers, writing treatises, and teaching students. Anne McGuire states that it is unclear whether this description of Marcellina in relation to Carpocrates is a result of Irenaeus's own patriarchal worldview, the actual relationship between her and him, or both.\n\nMarcellina's use of images of Jesus and Greek philosophers would not have been unusual in Roman society at the time, because busts and images of philosophers were common objects of adoration in second-century Roman society. While Irenaeus interprets this as a sign of Marcellina's heterodox teaching, to any non-Christian Roman, it would have actually made her seem far less aberrant than \"orthodox\" Christians. By venerating busts of philosophers and including Jesus among them as the greatest, Marcellina's followers were honoring him in the same way that other philosophers were typically honored throughout the Greco-Roman world. The Carpocratians may have had a more intellectual outlook than other sects, since, according to Clement of Alexandria, Carpocrates's son Epiphanes had been trained in Platonic philosophy. Nonetheless, Michael Allen Williams states that the veneration of images seems highly unexpected for a supposedly Gnostic sect, since Gnostics are thought to have held the physical body in contempt. He suggests that Marcellina and her followers, like their pagan contemporaries, may have viewed representations of philosophers' physical likenesses as \"windows to the soul\" and a means of reflecting on the person's teachings. Peter Lampe interprets Marcillina's use of images of famous philosophers as an indication of religious syncretism.\n\nJoan E. Taylor notes that Irenaeus does not state that the Marcellians' portrait of Jesus was inaccurate or that portraits of Jesus were inherently immoral. She also argues that the Marcellians' busts of Jesus and other philosophers may have survived long after their sect declined, observing that, nearly a century later, the Roman emperor Alexander Severus (reigned 222 – 235) is said to have possessed a collection of portrait busts of various philosophers, religious figures, and historical figures including Jesus, Orpheus, Apollonius of Tyana, Alexander the Great, and Abraham. She remarks, \"For all we know, one of the many unidentified philosopher busts that exist in today's collections might have been thought of as Jesus in the second–third centuries.\"\n\nAccording to David Brakke, the reason why Marcellina and the members of her school identified themselves as \"Gnostics\" was not as a sectarian identification with the branch of early Christianity known as \"Gnosticism\", but rather as an epithet for \"the ideal or true Christian, the one whose acquaintance with God has been perfected\". He notes that Irenaeus himself identifies Marcellina and her sect with the Carpocratians, not with the \"Gnostic school of thought\". Also, Hippolytus of Rome, who relied on Irenaeus as a source, references that the another sect known as the Naassenes \"call themselves 'gnostics' in their own way, as if they alone have drunk from the amazing acquaintance of the Perfect and Good.\" In the late fourth century, the ascetic monk Evagrius Ponticus described the most advanced stage of Christian asceticism as \"the Gnostic\", indicating that, despite the association of the word \"Gnostic\" with Gnosticism, it still retained its original positive meaning in the sense with which Marcellina and her disciples identified. Bentley Layton does not classify Marcellina and her followers as members of the Gnostic sect either.\n\nOrigen ( 184 – 253) also briefly mentions Marcellina in his \"Contra Celsum\", stating that \"Celsus knows also of Marcellians who follow Marcellina, and Harpocratians who follow Salome, and others who follow Mariamme, and others who follow Martha.\" Anne McGuire states that, because all the other figures listed by Origen in this passage are figures who appear in the canonical gospels, it is possible that the Marcellians may have regarded Marcellina, not only as a teacher and religious leader, but as \"an authoritative source of apostolic tradition\". Williams notes that Origen seems to have been aware that the Marcellians called themselves Gnostics, since, elsewhere in \"Contra Celsum\", he notes that one of Celsus's arguments against Christianity was the existence of different sects, including ones \"who call themselves gnostics\". This would presumably include Marcellina and her followers, but Origen refrains from calling them by this term.\n\nIt is unclear how Marcellina and her followers were regarded by orthodox Christians living in Rome during the 150s and 160s. Irenaeus states that, among members of his own congregation in Gaul in the 180s, \"we have no fellowship with them either in doctrine or in morals or in our daily social life\", but this statement should not be taken to apply to Christians living in Rome over twenty years prior. Irenaeus also states, \"Satan had set forth these people [i.e. Marcellina and her followers] to blaspheme the holy name of the church, so that the [pagan] people turn their ears from the preaching of truth when they hear their different way of teaching and think we Christians are all like them. Indeed, when they see their religiosity, they dishonor us all.\" He adds that \"They misuse the name [Christian] as a mask.\" This indicates that Marcellina and her Carpocratian followers called themselves \"Christians\" and, at least to outsiders, her sect appeared to be connected to other branches of Christianity.\n\nPeter Lampe states that it is possible that members of the orthodox community in Rome simply allowed Marcillina and her sect to silently coexist, but that it is also possible that they may have actively condemned them. Robert M. Grant identifies the anti-Gnostic writings of Polycarp and Justin Martyr as partially an indirect reaction against Marcellina and her permissive moral teachings. Marcillina and other female prophets like her were consistently portrayed negatively in the histories and canons written by proponents of orthodoxy. According to William H. Brackney, sources indicate that Carpocratians may have continued to exist as late as the fourth century.\n\n"}

She is a prize-winning writer of nonfiction, an essayist, feminist, and activist. Her contributions to the field of cultural studies of age include four books, the latest of which is \"Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America\" (2011). Other books of Gullette's that have been influential (in humanistic and cultural gerontology, history, literary and cultural criticism, sociology and anthropology, performance and film studies, life writing and narrative theory, fashion studies, and feminist health activism) include \"Aged by Culture\" (2004), \"Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife\" (1997); and \"Safe at Last in the Middle Years: The Invention of the Midlife Progress Novel\" (1988).\n\nMargaret Morganroth was born in Brooklyn, NY, the first child of Betty Morganroth and Martin Morganroth. She was educated through high school at public schools and received scholarships to go to college and graduate school. Morganroth Gullette holds a B.A. magna cum laude Phi Beta Kappa from Radcliffe College, a M.A. from University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University.\n\nBefore becoming a Scholar in the Women's Studies Research Center in 1996, she had previously worked at the Harvard-Danforth Center for Teaching and Learning and had been a visiting scholar at Harvard; the Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe; Northeastern University; Wellesley Center for Research on Women. At the Danforth (now Bok) Center, she edited \"The Art and Craft of Teaching\". She continues to publish in the field of pedagogy and education. [citation needed]\n\nWorking in the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe, Gullette found a lost novel by the late nineteenth-century English feminist, Mona Caird, \"The Daughters of Danaus\", and wrote an introduction for the Feminist Press reissue. Early in the feminist second wave, she published a feminist children's book called \"The Lost Bellybutton\" (1976). [citation needed]\n\nShe was invited to be the George A. Miller Visiting Professor, at the Center for Advanced Studies, University of Illinois (Urbana/ Champaign), in the spring of 2000. She is an Advisory Editor to the new journal, \"Age, Culture, Humanities: An Interdisciplinary Journal\", and on the book series, Aging Studies in Europe (LIT Verlag). She is on the Advisory Committee of the European Network on Aging (ENAS). She was on the Advisory Committee of the \"Journal of Aging, the Humanities, and the Arts\", 2006 2010 and co editor, Age Studies Series, University Press of Virginia, 1993 1999.\n\nMike Hepworth, the late British cultural gerontologist (1957–2012), in a review of Gullette's work through 1999, calls her \"one of America's foremost critics of the concept of ageing as a universal and comprehensive process of decline. She is a formidable critic of biological essentialism, defender of social constructionism, and opponent of 'middle ageism'\" (Hepworth 1999, Abstract), and the author of an \"increasingly influential range of publications on the social construction of ageing\" (Hepworth 1999, 139) and the life course in the United States. Gullette emerged during the 1990s and beyond as \"the primary theorist and practitioner of what she called 'age studies'\" (Cole and Ray 2010, 17). Gullette named the field of \"age studies\" in 1993 (Gullette 1993, 45–46). The term is used by the Modern Language Association and in the humanities in preference to \"aging studies.\"\n\n\"Her principal thesis is that we are aged by culture. What she means is that much of what we experience as we get older is not the ineluctable consequence of biological ageing . . . but is socially and culturally contingent. American society, she contends, has become a rich terrain on which the social and cultural exclusion of people as they age can take place and where the ideology of ageing can flourish\" (Tulle 2006: 127). Age studies tries to understand age and aging as complex, intersectional social and psychological constructions, and also as a set of mediated relationships among people located at different phases of the life course.\n\n\"Age studies sees 'age' and 'aging' in culture as resulting as much from ideologies as from biology\" (Ball 2006, 214). Gullette has said that she offers a radical social constructionism that pushes \"'the natural' out of context after context\" (Gullette 1997 246 n42). \"Neither Featherstone and Hepworth nor Gullette denied the existence of bodily ageing, although their work has at times been interpreted as coming near to doing so, with their emphasis on the cultural constitution of the body. . . . As a result, their work has been criticised by those who see it as endorsing a false dualism of the body and the self.\" (Twigg, 2007)\n\n\"Margaret Morganroth Gullette has documented ways in which the pervasive ageism of Western cultures is often coded into a narrative structure that associates old age with inevitable decline and decay. Although this 'decline ideology' might seem to work against the futurist assumption of redemptive hope, Gullette explains that we are trained to assume the decline of the old in order to make room for the more highly valued young. To counter this tendency, Gullette urges the proliferation of 'progress narratives,' which project 'a moving image of the self through its past and onward to its better future' (Port 2012, 5–6 ) One of her theoretical moves has been to undermine the binary between \"progress narrative,\" automatically applied to children and younger people; and \"decline narrative,\" automatically applied to people who have aged past midlife.\n\nGullette's term \"age autobiography\" is a call for individual authors to write more knowledgeably and critically about the mediated forces that insinuate themselves into our sense of \"aging.\" \"And once we begin to think age, a more mysterious and intangible project emerges: to discover what our own culture is serving up for us, and what each of us has consumed or resisted\" (Gullette 1993, 46). \"The term itself [\"the master narrative of aging\"] was coined by Margaret Morganroth Gullette and is designed to identify a recognizable ensemble of cultural practices. . . \" (Kunow 2011, 26). The \"master narrative of decline\" requires a single self going through a linear trajectory, while \"the portmanteau self\" is \"an active concept of aging as self narrated experience, the conscious, ongoing story of one's age identity\" (Gullette 1997: 220). Fragments of Gullette's own age autobiography appear in many of her nonfiction works. Cynthia Port singles out \"one powerful essay [in which] Gullette argues that the fashion system teaches us to detach ourselves from and then discard clothes and other no longer fashionable commodities as a means of training ourselves for our own obsolescence in old age\": \"The Other End of the Fashion Cycle: Practicing Loss, Learning Decline\" (Port 2012, n26).\n\nGullette has been called \"one of gerontology's few public intellectuals,\" who demonstrates \"how a scholar works to change the minds of general readers about aging and ageism\" (Ray and Cole 2010: 8). \"The whole point, as Gullette (1988, 1993, 1997) has vividly shown in her analyses of fictional representations of ageing, is to discover how our personal ideas about ageing (positive/ negative/ ambiguous) are shaped by our culture and are therefore open to the possibility of change\" (Hepworth 2000, 3). Convinced that our terminology about age is impoverished, she encourages the use of terms like \"aging-past-youth,\" aging-into-the-middle years,\" and \"aging-into-old age\" (Gullette 1998, 3–44). She argues in several books (1997, 2004, 2011) that collective sociopolitical changes are necessary.\n\n\"Staging Age\", edited by Valerie Barnes Lipscomb and Leni Marshall, gives credit to Gullette's work in establishing the field of age studies, and advancing concepts about how age can be considered a performance (Lipscomb and Marshall 2010, 1–3). She invented the term \"middle ageism\" (Gullette 1998, 3–44) to name the cluster of discriminations suffered by people in their middle years, from job discrimination to \"Boomer-bashing\" and decline discourse about sexuality, looks, and intellectual and cognitive competence. Other concepts developed by Gullette—such as \"age ideology,\" \"being aged by culture,\" and the use of \"progress narrative\" as a way out of the binary between \"positive aging\" and \"decline narrative\"—have been adopted by scholars in a range of disciplines.\n\nGullette's concepts and formulations have been disseminated through a number of chapters and essays or excerpts that have appeared in anthologies, including \n\"A Guide to Humanistic Studies in Aging\" (2010), \n\"Narratives of Life: Mediating Age\" (Munich 2009), \n\"Opposing Viewpoints: The Aging Population\" (2009), \n\"Sociology: Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life.

(And Other Cultural Fictions)\" (1998); \n\"Aging and Gender in Literature: Studies in Creativity\" (1993). \nWorking as a freelance writer in parallel to her scholarly career, Gullette also publishes in mainstream, feminist, and progressive newspapers, magazines, and blogs.

Gullette's chapter, 'Overcoming the Terror of Forgetfulness,' in \"Agewise\" was called \"the best essay on memory loss that I have read. Based partly on the author's experiences with her mother, it reveals her deep compassion and insight\" (Cruikshank 2011, 26).\n\n\"Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America\" (2011) won a 2012 Eric Hoffer Book Prize. \"Aged by Culture\" (2004), was chosen as a Noteworthy Book of the year by the \"Christian Science Monitor\". It was nominated for a Pulitzer and received an Honorable Mention from the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights. \"Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife\" (1997) won the Emily Toth award in 1998 for the best feminist book on American popular culture.\n\nGullette has held fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies. She held a Bunting Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute in 1986–87 while finishing \"Safe at Last in the Middle Years\".\n\nHer essay, \"The Contagion of Euphoria,\" won the Daniel Singer Millennial Prize in 2008. Other essays, frequently cited as notable in \"Best American Essays\", have appeared in many literary and cultural quarterlyes, including \"Kenyon Review\", \"Michigan Quarterly Review\", \"American Scholar\", and \"Yale Review\"; and in scholarly journals like \"Feminist Studies\", \"Representations\", \"New Political Science\", \"Profession\", and the \"Journal of the History of Sexuality\". Quotations from her books appear in \"The Quotable Woman: The First Five Thousand Years\" (2010). She is a long-term member of PEN-America, to which she was nominated by Carolyn Heilbrun and Alix Kates Shulman. In 2005 she won the Virginia Liebeler Biennial Grant for Mature Women in Letters from the National League of American Pen Women.\n\nIn 2012 Gullette won the Marigold \"Ideas for Good\" Prize, which carries an award of $5000, for her work as the co-founder and director of development for The Free High School for Adults, San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, the sister city of Newton, MA, where she lives.

This effect was first described in 2008.\n\nPresently, this effect is described only for controlled experimental conditions. In the illustration, a viewer should have a strong impression that the left display (lower figure) is more numerous than the right, after 30 seconds of viewing the adaptation (upper figure), although both have exactly the same number of dots. The viewer might also underestimate the number of dots presented in the display.\n\nBoth effects are resistant to manipulation of the non-numerical parameters of the display. Thus, this effect cannot be simply explained in terms of size, density, or contrast.\n\nPerhaps the most astonishing aspect of these effects is that they happen immediately, and without conscious control (i.e., knowing that the numbers are equal would not hamper their happening). This points to the operation of a special and largely automatic processing system. As noted by Burr & Ross (2008):\n\nFew explanations were suggested to explain these phenomena. It was argued that they are heavily dependent on density and less on numerosity. Also, it was suggested that numerosity may be correlated with kurtosis and that the results may be better explained in terms of texture density such that only dots falling within the spatial region where the test is displayed effectively adapt the region.\n\nHowever, as the display in the original experiments was of spots uniformly either white or black, the kurtosis account is inapplicable. The texture density explanation doesn't seem to disentangle the complexity of these phenomena as in the display the left field adapts to many dots, the right field to few, and these adapters selectively affect the relevant test stimuli. It is not the number of dots in the entire display that causes the adaptation but only those within a particular area. At present, why adaptation have such profound effect on numerosity estimates remains largely unexplained.\n\n"}
{"id": "32086658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32086658", "title": "Nutrient cycle", "text": "Nutrient cycle\n\nA nutrient cycle (or ecological recycling) is the movement and exchange of organic and inorganic matter back into the production of matter. Energy flow is a unidirectional and noncyclic pathway, whereas the movement of mineral nutrients is cyclic. Mineral cycles include the carbon cycle, sulfur cycle, nitrogen cycle, water cycle, phosphorus cycle, oxygen cycle, among others that continually recycle along with other mineral nutrients into productive ecological nutrition.\n\nThe nutrient cycle is nature's recycling system. All forms of recycling have feedback loops that use energy in the process of putting material resources back into use. Recycling in ecology is regulated to a large extent during the process of decomposition. Ecosystems employ biodiversity in the food webs that recycle natural materials, such as mineral nutrients, which includes water. Recycling in natural systems is one of the many ecosystem services that sustain and contribute to the well-being of human societies.\n\nThere is much overlap between the terms for the biogeochemical cycle and nutrient cycle. Most textbooks integrate the two and seem to treat them as synonymous terms. However, the terms often appear independently. Nutrient cycle is more often used in direct reference to the idea of an intra-system cycle, where an ecosystem functions as a unit. From a practical point, it does not make sense to assess a terrestrial ecosystem by considering the full column of air above it as well as the great depths of Earth below it. While an ecosystem often has no clear boundary, as a working model it is practical to consider the functional community where the bulk of matter and energy transfer occurs. Nutrient cycling occurs in ecosystems that participate in the \"larger biogeochemical cycles of the earth through a system of inputs and outputs.\"\n\nEcosystems are capable of complete recycling. Complete recycling means that 100% of the waste material can be reconstituted indefinitely. This idea was captured by Howard T. Odum when he penned that \"it is thoroughly demonstrated by ecological systems and geological systems that all the chemical elements and many organic substances can be accumulated by living systems from background crustal or oceanic concentrations without limit as to concentration so long as there is available solar or another source of potential energy\" In 1979 Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen proposed the fourth law of entropy stating that complete recycling is impossible. Despite Georgescu-Roegen's extensive intellectual contributions to the science of ecological economics, the fourth law has been rejected in line with observations of ecological recycling. However, some authors state that complete recycling is impossible for technological waste.\n\nEcosystems execute closed loop recycling where demand for the nutrients that adds to the growth of biomass exceeds supply within that system. There are regional and spatial differences in the rates of growth and exchange of materials, where some ecosystems may be in nutrient debt (sinks) where others will have extra supply (sources). These differences relate to climate, topography, and geological history leaving behind different sources of parent material. In terms of a food web, a cycle or loop is defined as \"a directed sequence of one or more links starting from, and ending at, the same species.\" An example of this is the microbial food web in the ocean, where \"bacteria are exploited, and controlled, by protozoa, including heterotrophic microflagellates which are in turn exploited by ciliates. This grazing activity is accompanied by excretion of substances which are in turn used by the bacteria so that the system more or less operates in a closed circuit.\"\n\nAn example of ecological recycling occurs in the enzymatic digestion of cellulose. \"Cellulose, one of the most abundant organic compounds on Earth, is the major polysaccharide in plants where it is part of the cell walls. Cellulose-degrading enzymes participate in the natural, \"ecological recycling\" of plant material.\" Different ecosystems can vary in their recycling rates of litter, which creates a complex feedback on factors such as the competitive dominance of certain plant species. Different rates and patterns of ecological recycling leaves a legacy of environmental effects with implications for the future evolution of ecosystems.\n\nEcological recycling is common in organic farming, where nutrient management is \"fundamentally different\" compared to agri-business styles of soil management. Organic farms that employ ecosystem recycling to a greater extent support more species (increased levels of biodiversity) and have a different food web structure. Organic agricultural ecosystems rely on the services of biodiversity for the recycling of nutrients through soils instead of relying on the supplementation of synthetic fertilizers. The model for ecological recycling agriculture adheres to the following principals:\n\n\nThe persistent legacy of environmental feedback that is left behind by or as an extension of the ecological actions of organisms is known as niche construction or ecosystem engineering. Many species leave an effect even after their death, such as coral skeletons or the extensive habitat modifications to a wetland by a beaver, whose components are recycled and re-used by descendants and other species living under a different selective regime through the feedback and agency of these legacy effects. Ecosystem engineers can influence nutrient cycling efficiency rates through their actions.\n\nEarthworms, for example, passively and mechanically alter the nature of soil environments. Bodies of dead worms passively contribute mineral nutrients to the soil. The worms also mechanically modify the physical structure of the soil as they crawl about (bioturbation), digest on the molds of organic matter they pull from the soil litter. These activities transport nutrients into the mineral layers of soil. Worms discard wastes that create worm castings containing undigested materials where bacteria and other decomposers gain access to the nutrients. The earthworm is employed in this process and the production of the ecosystem depends on their capability to create feedback loops in the recycling process.\n\nShellfish are also ecosystem engineers because they: 1) Filter suspended particles from the water column; 2) Remove excess nutrients from coastal bays through denitrification; 3) Serve as natural coastal buffers, absorbing wave energy and reducing erosion from boat wakes, sea level rise and storms; 4) Provide nursery habitat for fish that are valuable to coastal economies.\n\nFungi contribute to nutrient cycling and nutritionally rearrange patches of ecosystem creating niches for other organisms. In that way fungi in growing dead wood allow xylophages to grow and develop and xylophages, in turn, affect dead wood, contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest floor.\n\nNutrient cycling has a historical foothold in the writings of Charles Darwin in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms. Darwin wrote about \"the continued Following the Greeks, the idea of a hydrological cycle (water is considered a nutrient) was validated and quantified by Halley in 1687.\n\nIn 1926 Vernadsky coined the term biogeochemistry as a sub-discipline of geochemistry. However, the term nutrient cycle pre-dates biogeochemistry in a pamphlet on silviculture in 1899: \"These demands by no means pass over the fact that at places where sufficient quantities of humus are available and where, in case of continuous decomposition of litter, a stable, nutrient humus is present, considerable quantities of nutrients are also available from the biogenic \"nutrient cycle\" for the standing timber. In 1898 there is a reference to the nitrogen cycle in relation to nitrogen fixing microorganisms. Other uses and variations on the terminology relating to the process of nutrient cycling appear throughout history:\n\n\nWater is also a nutrient. In this context, some authors also refer to precipitation recycling, which \"is the contribution of evaporation within a region to precipitation in that same region.\" These variations on the theme of nutrient cycling continue to be used and all refer to processes that are part of the global biogeochemical cycles. However, authors tend to refer to natural, organic, ecological, or bio-recycling in reference to the work of nature, such as it is used in organic farming or ecological agricultural systems.\n\nAn endless stream of technological waste accumulates in different spatial configurations across the planet and turns into a predator in our soils, our streams, and our oceans. This idea was similarly expressed in 1954 by ecologist Paul Sears: \"We do not know whether to cherish the forest as a source of essential raw materials and other benefits or to remove it for the space it occupies. We expect a river to serve as both vein and artery carrying away waste but bringing usable material in the same channel. Nature long ago discarded the nonsense of carrying poisonous wastes and nutrients in the same vessels.\" Ecologists use population ecology to model contaminants as competitors or predators. Rachel Carson was an ecological pioneer in this area as her book \"Silent Spring\" inspired research into biomagification and brought to the worlds attention the unseen pollutants moving into the food chains of the planet.\n\nIn contrast to the planets natural ecosystems, technology (or technoecosystems) is not reducing its impact on planetary resources. Only 7% of total plastic waste (adding up to millions upon millions of tons) is being recycled by industrial systems; the 93% that never makes it into the industrial recycling stream is presumably \"absorbed\" by natural recycling systems In contrast and over extensive lengths of time (billions of years) ecosystems have maintained a consistent balance with production roughly equaling respiratory consumption rates. The balanced recycling efficiency of nature means that production of decaying waste material has exceeded rates of recyclable consumption into food chains equal to the global stocks of fossilized fuels that escaped the chain of decomposition.\n\nMicroplastics and nanosilver materials flowing and cycling through ecosystems from pollution and discarded technology are among a growing list of emerging ecological concerns. For example, unique assemblages of marine microbes have been found to digest plastic accumulating in the worlds oceans. Discarded technology is absorbed into soils and creates a new class of soils called technosols. Human wastes in the Anthropocene are creating new systems of ecological recycling, novel ecosystems that have to contend with the mercury cycle and other synthetic materials that are streaming into the biodegradation chain. Microorganisms have a significant role in the removal of synthetic organic compounds from the environment empowered by recycling mechanisms that have complex biodegradation pathways. The effect of synthetic materials, such as nanoparticles and microplastics, on ecological recycling systems is listed as one of the major concerns for ecosystem in this century.\n\nRecycling in human industrial systems (or technoecosystems) differs from ecological recycling in scale, complexity, and organization. Industrial recycling systems do not focus on the employment of ecological food webs to recycle waste back into different kinds of marketable goods, but primarily employ people and technodiversity instead. Some researchers have questioned the premise behind these and other kinds of technological solutions under the banner of 'eco-efficiency' are limited in their capability, harmful to ecological processes, and dangerous in their hyped capabilities. Many technoecosystems are competitive and parasitic toward natural ecosystems. Food web or biologically based \"recycling includes metabolic recycling (nutrient recovery, storage, etc.) and ecosystem recycling (leaching and \"in situ\" organic matter mineralization, either in the water column, in the sediment surface, or within the sediment.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4494157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4494157", "title": "Page playoff system", "text": "Page playoff system\n\nThe Page playoff system is a playoff format used primarily in softball and curling at the championship level, the Pakistan Super League, and the Indian Premier League cricket tournament. Teams are seeded using a round-robin tournament and the top four play a mix of a single-elimination and double-elimination tournament to determine the winner. It is identical to a four-team McIntyre System playoff, first used by the Victorian Football League in Australia in 1931, originally called the Page–McIntyre system, after the VFL delegate, the Richmond Football Club's Secretary, Percy \"Pip\" Page, who had advocated its use.\n\nThe Page playoff system was used at the Australian Rugby League Championship 1954-1972. In Australia, its most notable use today is in netball, having been adopted by Suncorp Super Netball when it began play in 2017.\n\nThe system has been used since 1990 by the International Softball Federation and its successor, the World Baseball Softball Confederation, for the Women's Softball World Championship and from 1996 to 2008 at the Olympic Games.\n\nIts first use in curling was by the Canadian Curling Association in the 1995 Labatt Brier, the men's championship, and was adopted the next year at the 1996 Scott Tournament of Hearts, the women's championship. It gained acceptance and in 2005 the World Curling Championships started using it, but it has not yet been adopted in curling at the Olympic Games.\n\nThe format is used in the Indian Premier League cricket tournament since 2011.\n\nThe format has also been used in some much lower-key, internet gaming events, such as chess and backgammon.\n\nThe system requires teams to be ranked in some way, as the top two teams have an advantage over the bottom two. This is usually accomplished through a round-robin tournament, which eliminates all but the top four teams.\n\nA standard round-robin tournament is used, in which all teams play each other once. Because the number of total games increases quadratically with respect to the number of teams, scheduling too many teams will result in an unwieldy number of games, particularly when there are a limited number of playing surfaces (curling rinks usually only have four sheets). Therefore, the number of teams is usually capped at around a dozen; if this is not possible or desirable, teams may be separated into groups playing separate round-robins and either having the top teams combining for the Page playoff or playing separate ones in each group and having the winners play each other after.\n\nThe system was invented in Australia in the early 1930s and adopted soon after by the Victorian Football League (now known as the Australian Football League). The top four teams advance to the playoffs, which are played over three rounds with one team being eliminated in each round. \n\nThe format progresses as follows:\n\nThis system gives the top two teams a double chance, in that they can lose their first game and still go on to win the title, producing a similar though not identical effect to a double-elimination tournament. This gives the top two teams a significant advantage over the next two, since winning the title from third or fourth place requires winning one more game than winning from first or second, and also requires defeating every other team in the playoffs. Additionally, the higher ranked team in any pairing (which, in the final, is automatically the team which won Game 2) will play as the home team to provide an additional advantage; in the case of curling teams, where teams rarely play national or international tournaments at their home rink, the advantage is that the first-placed team is given the hammer (last rock) in the first end, which is a reasonable advantage between comparably skilled teams.\n\nIn the 2008 World Women's Curling championship, a fifth match was added to the format: a bronze medal playoff match, which was played between the two teams which did not qualify for the final (the losers of Games 1 and 3). This game is normally scheduled between Games 3 and 4. Previously, the bronze would have automatically been awarded to the team which lost Game 3, so this game provides a chance for the loser of Game 1 to still receive a medal. This was also introduced at the national level at the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts and the 2011 Tim Hortons Brier. The bronze medal game was heavily criticized for being \"meaningless\" in part because simply winning a \"medal\" does not carry the same sort of prestige it does in the Olympic Games. The bronze medal game was eliminated prior to the 2018 Canadian championship curling season.\n\nIn Australia, Games 1 and 2 are known as \"Semi-Finals\"; Game 3 is called the \"Preliminary Final\", and the final is known as the \"Grand Final\". To distinguish between the two Semi-Finals, which are different in nature, the match between 3rd and 4th is known either as the \"First Semi-Final\" or the \"Minor Semi-Final\"; and the match between 1st and 2nd is known either as the \"Second Semi-Final\" or the \"Major Semi-Final\".\n\nIn Curling, Games 1 and 2 are usually known as the \"Page Playoffs\" (and Game 2 is usually played first, to give the higher-ranked team more rest before Game 3); Game 3 is called the \"Semi-Final\", and the final is known by that name. However, some sources, in order to distinguish between Games 1 and 2, refer only to Game 2 as a \"Page Playoff\" while referring to Game 1 as the \"Quarter-Final.\"\n\nIn India, Game 1 is known as the \"Eliminator\", Games 2 and 3 are called \"Qualifiers\", and the final is known by that name.\n\n1931 Victorian Football League playoffs\n\nThe first-ever use of the system was in Australia in 1931 after the Victorian Football League adopted it. The regular season ended with Geelong winning the minor premiership, followed by Richmond, Carlton and Collingwood. The finals proceeded as follows:\n\nPage playoff results from the 2004 Nokia Brier:\n\nPage playoff, including a bronze medal match, from the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts.\n\nPlayers and fans alike have had a mixed reaction to the system. Broadcasters enjoy it as it produces one more game than the single elimination format.\n\n"}

Specifically, the pleasure principle is the driving force guiding the id.\n\nEpicurus in the ancient world, and Jeremy Bentham in the modern, laid stress upon the role of pleasure in directing human life, the latter stating: \"Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, \"pain\" and \"pleasure\"\".\n\nFreud's most immediate predecessor and guide however was Gustav Theodor Fechner and his psychophysics.\n\nFreud used the idea that the mind seeks pleasure and avoids pain in his \"Project for a Scientific Psychology\" of 1895, as well as in the theoretical portion of \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" of 1900, where he termed it the 'unpleasure principle'.\n\nIn the \"Two Principles of Mental Functioning\" of 1911, contrasting it with the reality principle, Freud spoke for the first time of \"the pleasure-unpleasure principle, or more shortly the pleasure principle\". In 1923, linking the pleasure principle to the libido he described it as the watchman over life; and in \"Civilization and its Discontents\" of 1930 he still considered that \"what decides the purpose of life is simply the programme of the pleasure principle\".\n\nWhile on occasion Freud wrote of the near omnipotence of the pleasure principle in mental life, elsewhere he referred more cautiously to the mind's strong (but not always fulfilled) \"tendency\" towards the pleasure principle.\n\nFreud contrasted the pleasure principle with the counterpart concept of the reality principle, which describes the capacity to defer gratification of a desire when circumstantial reality disallows its immediate gratification. In infancy and early childhood, the id rules behavior by obeying only the pleasure principle. People at that age only seek immediate gratification, aiming to satisfy cravings such as hunger and thirst, and at later ages the id seeks out sex.\n\nMaturity is learning to endure the pain of deferred gratification. Freud argued that “an ego thus educated has become ‘reasonable’; it no longer lets itself be governed by the pleasure principle, but obeys the reality principle, which also, at bottom, seeks to obtain pleasure, but pleasure which is assured through taking account of reality, even though it is pleasure postponed and diminished”.\n\nIn his book \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\", published in 1921, Freud considered the possibility of \"the operation of tendencies \"beyond\" the pleasure principle, that is, of tendencies more primitive than it and independent of it\". Through an examination the role of repetition compulsion in potentially over-riding the pleasure principle, Freud ultimately developed his opposition between Libido, the life instinct, and the death drive.\n\n"}
{"id": "30331208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30331208", "title": "Postponement of affect", "text": "Postponement of affect\n\nPostponement of affect is a defence mechanism which may be used against a variety of feelings or emotions. Such a 'temporal displacement, resulting simply in a later appearance of the affect reaction and in thus preventing the recognition of the motivating connection, is most frequently used against the affects of rage (or annoyance) and grief'.\n\nIn the affect of grief, postponement seems to be an essential component. What happens in mourning is nothing other than a gradual \"working-through\" of an affect which, if released in its full strength, would overwhelm the ego'. John Bowlby considered the first of the \"four phases of mourning\" to be a 'Phase of numbness that...may be interrupted by outbursts of extremely intense distress and/or anger'. Thus one can speak of 'a rather typical postponement of grief': '\"I feel hurt about something and then automatically this kind of shields things up and then I feel like I can't really touch or feel anything very much\"...\"postponement\"...[of] the weepiness'.\n\nConversely, Eric Lindemann, describing 'the symptomatology and management of acute grief following the Coconut Grove night-club fire...showed that people who do not \"break down\" and express feelings appropriate to a bereavement may suffer from delayed or distorted grief'.\n\nInvestigation of 'the reaction of the ego to acute mortal danger...repeatedly found an absence of fear during the period of acute danger, but a subsequent appearance of acute fear when the danger was past'. This may be a contributing factor in post-traumatic stress disorder, where the sufferer may be 'the victim...of a blocked fear tension...he hadn't had the time to feel the fear'.\n\n'The postponement of fright is so well known to movie writers that it is not only frequently used but also designated by a special term: double-take'.\n\nDefence against guilt feelings may involve people using postponement by way of 'an \"isolation\" of guilt feeling...they do things without any guilt feeling, and experience an exaggerated feeling of guilt on some other occasion without being aware of the connection'. Such postponement can be linked to Nietzsche's concept of the \"pale criminal\" or 'neurotic immoralist...the \"pale felon\" who does not live up to his acts' – retrospective guilt: 'he was equal to his deed when he did it; but he could not bear its image after it was done...now the lead of his guilt lies upon him'.\n\nA similar postponement of guilt may be seen in everyday life, as when 'a woman may decide that her Superego will permit her to cheat on her spouse...[but] may begin to feel guilty many years afterwards..\n\nIn pathological form something similar would seem to occur 'during a melancholic attack', or so Freud surmised: the 'super-ego becomes over-severe, abuses the poor ego...reproaches it for actions in the remotest past which had been taken lightly at the time – as though it had spent the whole interval in collecting accusations and had only been waiting for its current access of strength in order to bring them up'.\n\nConversely, 'people who can muster the courage to face up to their guilt...will not suffer as long from the agony of the cognitive rehearsal of the guilt situation as people who postpone facing up to their guilt'.\n\nFreud saw the development of the reality principle as a process which 'demands and carries into effect the postponement of satisfaction...and the temporary toleration of unpleasure as a step on the long indirect road to pleasure'. Such impulse control has been seen as a key component in emotional intelligence. 'The ability to delay gratification contributes powerfully to intellectual potential quite apart from IQ itself', while what has been called '\"goal-directed self-imposed delay of gratification\" is perhaps the essence of emotional self-regulation: the ability to deny impulse in the service of a goal'.\n\nSimilarly, among the defence mechanisms, as part of 'the \"mature\" ways of dealing with real stress...there's \"suppression\" – instead of repressing a frightening feeling and pushing it right out of awareness, you hold it in check and bear the discomfort of \"feeling\" it. That means you are more likely to be able to work out how to handle it, given a bit of time'. In this sense, 'delaying, as opposed to avoidance, is a fine mechanism, another form of the method of learning I call step-by-step'.\n\n"}
{"id": "1965727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1965727", "title": "Presupposition", "text": "Presupposition\n\nIn the branch of linguistics known as pragmatics, a presupposition (or PSP) is an implicit assumption about the world or background belief relating to an utterance whose truth is taken for granted in discourse. Examples of presuppositions include:\n\nA presupposition must be mutually known or assumed by the speaker and addressee for the utterance to be considered appropriate in context. It will generally remain a necessary assumption whether the utterance is placed in the form of an assertion, denial, or question, and can be associated with a specific lexical item or grammatical feature (presupposition trigger) in the utterance.\n\nCrucially, negation of an expression does not change its presuppositions: \"I want to do it again\" and \"I don't want to do it again\" both presuppose that the subject has done it already one or more times; \"My wife is pregnant\" and \"My wife is not pregnant\" both presuppose that the subject has a wife. In this respect, presupposition is distinguished from entailment and implicature. For example, \"The president was assassinated\" entails that \"The president is dead\", but if the expression is negated, the entailment is not necessarily true.\n\nIf presuppositions of a sentence are not consistent with the actual state of affairs, then one of two approaches can be taken. Given the sentences \"My wife is pregnant\" and \"My wife is not pregnant\" when one has no wife, then either:\n\nBertrand Russell tries to solve this dilemma with two interpretations of the negated sentence:\n\nFor the first phrase, Russell would claim that it is false, whereas the second would be true according to him.\n\nA presupposition of a part of an utterance is sometimes also a presupposition of the whole utterance, and sometimes not. For instance, the phrase \"my wife\" triggers the presupposition that I have a wife. The first sentence below carries that presupposition, even though the phrase occurs inside an embedded clause. In the second sentence, however, it does not. John might be mistaken about his belief that I have a wife, or he might be deliberately trying to misinform his audience, and this has an effect on the meaning of the second sentence, but, perhaps surprisingly, not on the first one.\nThus, this seems to be a property of the main verbs of the sentences, \"think\" and \"say\", respectively. After work by Lauri Karttunen, verbs that allow presuppositions to \"pass up\" to the whole sentence (\"project\") are called holes, and verbs that block such passing up, or \"projection\" of presuppositions are called plugs. Some linguistic environments are intermediate between plugs and holes: They block some presuppositions and allow others to project. These are called filters. An example of such an environment are indicative conditionals (\"If-then\" clauses). A conditional sentence contains an \"antecedent\" and a \"consequent\". The antecedent is the part preceded by the word \"if,\" and the consequent is the part that is (or could be) preceded by \"then.\" If the consequent contains a presupposition trigger, and the triggered presupposition is explicitly stated in the antecedent of the conditional, then the presupposition is blocked. Otherwise, it is allowed to project up to the entire conditional. Here is an example:\nHere, the presupposition triggered by the expression \"my wife\" (that I have a wife) is blocked, because it is stated in the antecedent of the conditional: That sentence doesn't imply that I have a wife. In the following example, it is not stated in the antecedent, so it is allowed to project, i.e. the sentence \"does\" imply that I have a wife.\nHence, conditional sentences act as \"filters\" for presuppositions that are triggered by expressions in their consequent.\n\nA significant amount of current work in semantics and pragmatics is devoted to a proper understanding of when and how presuppositions project.\n\nA presupposition trigger is a lexical item or linguistic construction which is responsible for the presupposition. The following is a selection of presuppositional triggers following Stephen C. Levinson's classic textbook on \"Pragmatics\", which in turn draws on a list produced by Lauri Karttunen. As is customary, the presuppositional triggers themselves are italicized, and the symbol » stands for 'presupposes'.\n\nDefinite descriptions are phrases of the form \"the X\" where X is a noun phrase. The description is said to be \"proper\" when the phrase applies to exactly one object, and conversely, it is said to be \"improper\" when either there exist more than one potential referents, as in \"the senator from Ohio\", or none at all, as in \"the king of France\". In conventional speech, definite descriptions are implicitly assumed to be proper, hence such phrases trigger the presupposition that the referent is unique and existent.\n\nIn Western epistemology, there is a tradition originating with Plato of defining knowledge as justified true belief. On this definition, for someone to know X, it is required that X be true. A linguistic question thus arises regarding the usage of such phrases: does a person who states \"John knows X\" implicitly claim the truth of X? Steven Pinker explored this question in a popular science format in a 2007 book on language and cognition, using a widely publicized example from a speech by a U.S. president. A 2003 speech by George W. Bush included the line, \"British Intelligence has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\" Over the next few years, it became apparent that this intelligence lead was incorrect. But the way the speech was phrased, using a factive verb, implicitly framed the lead as truth rather than hypothesis. There is however a strong alternative view that \"factivity thesis\", the proposition that relational predicates having to do with knowledge, such as \"knows, learn, remembers,\" and \"realized\", presuppose the factual truth of their object, is incorrect.\n\nSome further factive predicates: \"know; be sorry that; be proud that; be indifferent that; be glad that; be sad that.\"\n\n\nSome further implicative predicates: \"X happened to V\"»X didn't plan or intend to \"V\"; \"X avoided Ving\"»X was expected to, or usually did, or ought to \"V\", etc.\n\n\nSome further change of state verbs: \"start; finish; carry on; cease; take\" (as in \"X took Y from Z\" » Y was at/in/with Z); \"leave; enter; come; go; arrive;\" etc.\n\n\nFurther iteratives: \"another time; to come back; restore; repeat; for the nth time.\"\n\n\nFurther temporal clause constructors: \"after; during; whenever; as\" (as in \"As John was getting up, he slipped\").\n\n\nComparisons and contrasts may be marked by stress (or by other prosodic means), by particles like \"too\", or by comparatives constructions.\n\n\nQuestions often presuppose what the assertive part of the question presupposes, but interrogative parts might introduce further presuppositions. There are three different types of questions: yes/no questions, alternative questions and WH-questions.\n\n\nA presupposition of a sentence must normally be part of the common ground of the utterance context (the shared knowledge of the interlocutors) in order for the sentence to be felicitous. Sometimes, however, sentences may carry presuppositions that are not part of the common ground and nevertheless be felicitous. For example, I can, upon being introduced to someone, out of the blue explain that \"my wife is a dentist,\" this without my addressee having ever heard, or having any reason to believe that I have a wife. In order to be able to interpret my utterance, the addressee must assume that I have a wife. This process of an addressee assuming that a presupposition is true, even in the absence of explicit information that it is, is usually called presupposition accommodation. We have just seen that presupposition triggers like \"my wife\" (definite descriptions) allow for such accommodation. In \"Presupposition and Anaphora: Remarks on the Formulation of the Projection Problem\", the philosopher Saul Kripke noted that some presupposition triggers do not seem to permit such accommodation. An example of that is the presupposition trigger too. This word triggers the presupposition that, roughly, something parallel to what is stated has happened. For example, if pronounced with emphasis on \"John\", the following sentence triggers the presupposition that somebody other than John had dinner in New York last night.\nBut that presupposition, as stated, is completely trivial, given what we know about New York. Several million people had dinner in New York last night, and that in itself doesn't satisfy the presupposition of the sentence. What is needed for the sentence to be felicitous is really that somebody relevant to the interlocutors had dinner in New York last night, and that this has been mentioned in the previous discourse, or that this information can be recovered from it. Presupposition triggers that disallow accommodation are called anaphoric presupposition triggers.\n\nCritical discourse analysis (CDA) seeks to identify presuppositions of an ideological nature. CDA is critical, not only in the sense of being analytical, but also in the ideological sense. \nVan Dijk (2003) says CDA \"primarily studies the way social power abuse, dominance, and inequality\" operate in speech acts (including written text)—\"text and talk\". Van Dijk describes CDA as written from a particular point of view: \"dissendent research\" aimed to \"expose\" and \"resist social inequality.\" One notable feature of ideological presuppositions researched in CDA is a concept termed synthetic personalisation.\n\n\n\n"}

Based on Janet Emig's breakdown of the writing process, the process is centered on the idea that students determine the content of the course by exploring the craft of writing using their own interests, language, techniques, voice, and freedom, and where students learn what people respond to and what they don't. Classroom activities often include peer work where students themselves are teaching, reviewing, brainstorming, and editing.\n\nHistorically, the ideas behind process were born out of increased college enrollment thanks to the GI Bill following World War II. Writing instructors began giving students more group work and found that, with guidance, students were able to identify and recognize areas that needed improvement in other students' papers, and that criticism also helped students recognize their own areas to strengthen [cite]. Composition scholars such as Janet Emig, Peter Elbow, and Donald Murray began considering how these methods could be used in the writing classroom. Emig, in her book, The Composing Processes of Twelfth Graders, broke down writing into distinct parts; these were later simplified into a basic three-step process by Murray: prewriting, writing, and rewriting (also called \"revision\").[2]\n\nProcess also gained prominence in the collegiate world as a reaction against the formalism composition methods, sometimes called \"current-traditional\" methods, that encouraged adherence to established modes of writing, such as the five-paragraph essay.\n\nProcess can be taught using a variety of methods intended to strengthen the relationship between students and instructor. In other words, classroom discussion and activities center on students' ability to mimic what has come before in hopes that they will understand what good writing is and learn to mimic it. Some of the methods include:\nPrewriting activities. These could include brainstorming and/or other freewriting activities, drawing conceptual maps, participating in an ethnographic study, research, and more.\nDrafting. Class time can be spent writing papers, and students can ask instructors for ideas or help.\nRevision. Instructors can designate class time for the revision of drafts and direct students to focus on rhetorical strategies.\nPortfolio-based assessment. Students are given a deadline, such as the end of a semester, and a goal, such as demonstrating skills like rhetorical awareness, conventional thinking, and source acceptance and integration. The intervening time is spent drafting and revising papers. Composition instructors serve as final authorities on the quality of work, helping students explore areas foreign to them, rather than more free wheeling teachers who tell students how to express their individuality. From among the papers they work on in the semester, students choose the papers the instructor considers to be their best and put them in a portfolio, which is graded by the instructor. Often students are graded on their drafts during the semester as well as on the work they produce at the end of it.\nReflection on the writing process.\n\nThomas Kent argues that process theories insist, “writing can be captured by a generalized process or a Big Theory,” and that process theory makes three central claims about writing: “(1) writing is private; (2) writing is not up for interpretation; and (3) writing can, and should be, highly organized.” \n\nWhen writing is conceived of and taught as a prescriptive and generalizable “process,” according to Gary Olson, useful implications arise in the creation of a Theory of Writing, a master narrative that attempts to “systematize something that simply is not susceptible to systematization.” \n\nSimilarly, George Pullman positions the writing process movement as a rhetorical narrative, positioned in history as a result of writing as an undervalued, utilitarian skill that could be universally transmitted in higher education (17). This emerged from “current traditional rhetoric” that originated at Harvard in the 1880s and peaked in the late 1960s. Writing became a highly scientific affair, rooted exclusively in empirical observation. Post-process theorists argue, however, that if the writing process “were really the way all successful writers write regardless of context, then unless all writing is somehow supportive of a single ideological system, there would be no obfuscatory ideological baggage attending the process.\" \n\nTheorists continue to discuss pedagogical and systemic implications of both process and post-process approaches to composition.\n\nProcess theorists themselves have had to identify and work around certain constraints the process method brings with it; namely:\n\nIf papers are not graded throughout the semester, students don't have any idea of the grade they are earning. Also, students might not be inclined to take control of the class content and decide what they want to explore; they may expect the instructor to provide material for them. Additionally, students may not improve their grammar and other writing conventions if content is emphasized over form.\n\nComposition classes are often overfilled, so instructors have to spend much of their time reading through drafts. Power can also be a struggle, for if student grades depend on a portfolio, then instructors have to find ways of encouraging and/or enforcing attendance.\nAnd if there are no rules as to what students may and may not write about, instructors have to be well-versed in a variety of discourses and ready to deal with conflict that may arise when two or more discourses meet (sometimes called a contact zone). Instructors must also find ways to encourage each student to explore and bring content to the course and must deal with diversity and a range of opinions on what should be done in the course.\n\nProcess rose to prominence in composition classrooms during the late 1960s and enjoyed its status as the gold standard method of teaching through the 1980s and into the 1990s. Many of its tenets are still used today; however, its popularity and methods have brought criticism from different composition theorists, such as post-process theorists, who charge that:\n\nAmir Kalan (2014) has explored the pedagogical potentials of post-process theory in an article entitled \"A Practice-Oriented Definition of Post-Process Second Language Writing Theory\".\n\nComposition studies\n\n\n"}

It generally refers to conflicts described by other researchers as \"protracted\" or \"intractable\", i.e. as complex, severe, commonly enduring, and often violent.\n\nWhen a group's identity is threatened or frustrated, intractable conflict is almost inevitable. \"Protracted social conflict\" as Edward Azar termed it, denotes hostile interactions between communal groups that are based in deep-seated racial, ethnic, religious and cultural hatreds, and that persist over long periods of time with sporadic outbreaks of violence.\n\nProtracted social conflict is a theory developed by Edward Azar. The term refers to conflict situations characterized by the prolonged and often violent struggle by communal groups for such basic needs as security, recognition, acceptance, fair access to political institutions, and economic participation.\n\nThe communal groups may experience deep-seated cleavages based upon racial, religious, cultural or ethnic lines. These cleavages are characterized by continuing hostility with sporadic outbreaks of violence; and caused by the frustration of human needs for security, recognition, and distributive justice.\n\nSuch identity-driven rifts are the result of an underlying fear of extinction that often grows within vulnerable ethnic groups who live with the memories or fear of persecution and massacre. Ethnic divisions and perceived threats often result in the domination of the state machinery by a single group or coalition of elites who deny access to basic human needs for the majority of the population.\n\nAzar argued that the denial of basic human needs to a large portion of the population initiated instances of protracted social violence. Four preconditions are isolated by Azar as the predominant sources of protracted social conflict: communal content, deprivation of human needs, governance and the State's role, and international linkages.\n\nThis element, which contributes to the initial creation of protracted social conflict, consists of the fact that people involved in protracted social conflicts create their own identity groups. Azar notes, \"that it is the relationship between identity groups and the states, which is at the core of the problem.\" He also cited the \"disarticulation between the state and society as a whole\" as a source of violence within a society.\n\nThis precondition also involves the reliance that many people have on their social groups; because governments in areas that experience protracted social conflict are often unable, incapable or unwilling to provide basic human necessities to the population, individuals turn to their social groups for stability. The resultant disconnection of society and the state can be linked to the colonial legacy, which, \"artificially imposed European ideas of territorial statehood onto a multitude of communal groups.\"\n\nThis results in the domination of certain identity groups over others. The dominant group isolates itself from the needs of other groups, leading to an even bigger separation between groups even within an ethnicity. To overcome this division of society, national identity must be stressed over individual group identity.\n\nTo alleviate the \"underdevelopments\" Azar holds responsible for protracted social violence, and in turn overcome the conflict resulting from underdevelopment, Azar points to the needs of security, development, political access and identity in terms of cultural and religious expression. Azar refers to these needs as non-negotiable; therefore, if these needs are not met, people will inevitably want a structural change to take place. Such a need for structural change is likely to result in a violent conflict.\n\nThis in turn emphasizes Azar's theory that the \"deprivation of human needs is the underlying source of protracted social conflict\" where conflict is emphasized by the collective grievances of a group of people. To overcome this deprivation of human needs to entire groups of people, the government must offer security on a multiplicity of levels to all of the constituent population.\n\nWith government being \"endowed with the authority to govern and use force where necessary to regulate society, to protect citizens, and to provide collective goods,\" the government plays a leading role in the satisfaction or lack of satisfaction of minority and identity groups.\n\nAzar states that protracted social conflicts can be characterized by \"incompetent, parochial, fragile, and authoritarian governments that fail to satisfy basic human needs.\" It is said that governments, expected to be unbiased and impartial, tend to be dominated by the leading identity groups or those groups that have been able to monopolize power within a country or territorial entity. This creates a \"crisis of legitimacy\" in the governance of these countries. The structure of the government needs to be changed so that all citizens are equally cared for and equally represented without bias or corruption.\n\nThis involves the \"political–economic relations of economic dependency within the international economic system, and the network of political-military linkages constituting regional and global patterns of clientage and cross-border interest.\"\n\nWeaker states, like those often involved in protracted social conflict, tend to be more influenced by outside connections both economically and politically. For example, many states are dependent on an external supply of armament. To overcome the dominance of the international economy, the country in question must work to build institutions that can ease global dependency and stimulate domestic economic growth.\n\nAs Edward Azar stated:\nConflict resolution approaches that focus on resources, or the interests of parties, may be appropriate means of conflict resolution in conflicts where the only issues are those of resource and interests; however, in protracted social conflicts the main issue is identity-based. Therefore, to be effective, a conflict resolution framework must specifically emphasize the needs and identities of the conflicting parties.\n\nRothman developed a unique approach of conflict resolution that is specifically designed to mitigate protracted social conflict. He terms this approach the ARIA model. In contrast to the model of interactive conflict resolution (ICR) that Fisher proposed in 1996, which includes identity as one of many human needs, the ARIA model \"keeps its focus more narrowly attuned to identity issues in particular.\" Rothman and Olson suggest that conflict can only be truly resolved when identity issues have been sufficiently addressed.\n\nThe ARIA model is a comprehensive, yet specific approach to resolving protracted social conflict. It attempts to break down \"the barrier of identity through a four-phased process.\" The various stages of the ARIA model are outlined below:\n\nThis first step focuses on the tangible \"what of the conflict.\" It is defined in \"us\" versus \"them\" terms and calls on the various entities to elaborate and make clear their underlying values and needs. By bringing animosities to the forefront, it is hoped that the mutual benefits of ending the conflict can be realized.\n\nAfter parties have articulated their animosities, the next stage is termed the reflexive–reframing stage where the \"why\" and \"who\" of the issue is examined. The identity needs of all sides are brought to the forefront with the goal of getting \"the disputants to move from positional bargaining to interest-based approaches.\" Rothman and Olson suggest that the parties should now engage in a \"deep dialogue\" to give a voice and structure to the underlying needs of the various parties. The needs of the various parties are, in turn, the underlying causes of the conflict. The effect of this stage is termed resonance, as each side has articulated their core concerns and heard the concerns of the other actors. At this point, actors begin to see where their identities converge, and where they diverge.\n\nThe third stage is termed \"inventing\" and focuses on the \"how\" of \"cooperatively resolving the conflict and its core through integrative solutions.\" This stage suggests a mutual attempt by all actors involved to create a mean of ending the conflict. It is suggested by Rothman and Olson that since both parties have now come to recognize the other's identity through the two previous stages, \"they can concretely explore collaboratively how the tangible issues ... of the conflict can be resolved without threatening the identity of the other.\" The invention of possible means of solutions leads directly to the fourth stage.\n\nThe fourth and final stage of the ARIA model addresses the \"why\" and \"who\" of the conflict, as well as the \"how\" of cooperation through the tangible \"what\" of solutions. Here, the conflict resolution process based on identity is completed by the concrete outlining of future actions. This stage leads to the tangible resolution of the conflict.\n\nThe Sri Lankan conflict exists primarily between the two majority ethnic groups, the Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhist and represent around 74% of the population, and the Tamil, who are mostly Hindu, representing around 18%. The majority of Tamils live in northern and eastern provinces and claim them as their traditional homeland.\n\nSince its independence in 1948 there has been a conflict between Sinhalese, which gained control over the Sri Lankan government, and different Tamil separatist movements. Among the Sinhalese, the anti-Tamil chauvinism started to spread and the Tamils were more and more disadvantaged and excluded. The incidents escalated into a war in July 1983, after the island-wide pogrom against Tamils.\n\nTamil secessionists saw the establishment of their own separate state as the only way for securing their people. The war, that has continued since then, has almost completely disrupted civil administration in the northern province and caused economic devastation of the whole country. As a consequence of this ethno-political violence around 65,000 people have been killed, hundreds of thousands injured, and millions displaced.\n\nAmong various Tamil separatist groups that have emerged, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have risen as the dominant fighting force in Sri Lanka. Their tactics, proscribed as terrorist by many countries, are ruthless, brutal and highly efficient in eliminating their opposition. They run a parallel government in many areas of the north and east of Sri Lanka.\n\nSince the start of war there were some attempts to reach a ceasefire. In 2002 the Ceasefire agreement was signed, and the government agreed to disarm all paramilitary groups in the north and east. But hostilities continued and even intensified.\n\nGovernment security forces conquered the LTTE on May 19, 2009 ending the conflict.\n\nBefore the independence of Cyprus, the island's Greek and Turkish communities coexisted relatively peacefully. The major conflict began with the independence in 1960, when Greek community wanted a union (\"enosis\") with Greece, to which the Turkish community opposed. The 1960 constitution brought a complex system of power-sharing, but both groups wanted to gain more advantages.\n\nWhen Greek Cypriots wanted to reduce autonomy and representation of Turkish Cypriots, the latter opposed it and intercommunal violence broke out. That led the two communities to embark on a hostile and protracted process of separation and segregation.\n\nWith the military coup in 1974 the situation erupted into a major crisis. Turkish military intervention followed and Turkish forces occupied around 38% of the northern part of the island. This invasion caused an exodus of about 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south. Later voluntary regrouping of population resulted in another 10,000 Greek Cypriots leaving the northern part, and 40,000 Turkish Cypriots moving to the north, which created two homogeneous ethnic zones on the island.\n\nIn 1975 the northern part declared Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, which declared independence in 1983 as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Turkey. In 1990s the southern Republic of Cyprus applied for a membership in the European Union, and the Turkish Cypriots on the other side turned to Turkey.\n\nAlthough the Cyprus conflict now lasts for a long time, its resolution does not seem to be close. Numerous peace proposals and plans have been made, but more or less unsuccessful. The pre-1974 proposals of different federal or centralist arrangements failed as one or the other side rejected them. The division in 1974 changed the demographics of Cyprus dramatically, putting it in a position where federalist model would be the most appropriate. But again, because of opposing interests all the proposals failed.\n\n"}

While, technically, \"pāramī\" and \"pāramitā\" are both Pāli terms, Pali literature makes far greater reference to \"pāramī\".\n\nDonald S. Lopez, Jr. describes the etymology of the term:\nTheravada teachings on the \"pāramīs\" can be found in late canonical books and post-canonical commentaries.\n\nIn the Pāli Canon, the \"Buddhavaṃsa\" lists the ten perfections (\"dasa pāramiyo\") as:\n\n\nTwo of the above virtues, mettā and \"upekkhā\", also are brahmavihāras.\n\nThe Theravādin teachings on the pāramīs can be found in canonical books (\"Jataka tales\", \"Apadāna\", \"Buddhavaṃsa\", \"Cariyāpiṭaka\") and post-canonical commentaries written to supplement the Pāli Canon at a later time, and thus might not be an original part of the Theravādin teachings. The oldest parts of the \"Sutta Piṭaka\" (for example, \"Majjhima Nikāya\", \"Digha Nikāya\", \"Saṃyutta Nikāya\" and the \"Aṅguttara Nikāya\") do not have any mention of the pāramīs as a category (though they are all mentioned individually).\n\nSome scholars even refer to the teachings of the pāramīs as a semi-Mahāyāna teaching added to the scriptures at a later time in order to appeal to the interests and needs of the lay community and to popularize their religion. However, these views rely on the early scholarly presumption of Mahāyāna originating with religious devotion and appeal to laity. More recently, scholars have started to open up early Mahāyāna literature, which is very ascetic and expounds the ideal of the monk's life in the forest. Therefore, the practice of the pāramitās in Buddhism is close to the ideals of the ascetic tradition of the śramaṇa.\n\nBodhi (2005) maintains that, in the earliest Buddhist texts (which he identifies as the first four \"nikāyas\"), those seeking the extinction of suffering (\"nibbana\") pursued the noble eightfold path. As time went on, a backstory was provided for the multi-life development of the Buddha; as a result, the ten perfections were identified as part of the path for the bodhisattva (Pāli: \"bodhisatta\"). Over subsequent centuries, the \"pāramīs\" were seen as being significant for aspirants to both Buddhahood and arahantship. Thus, Bodhi (2005) summarizes:\n\nIn Mahāyāna Buddhism, the Prajñapāramitā sūtras, the \"Lotus Sutra\" and a large number of other texts list the six perfections:\n\n\nNote that this list is also mentioned by the Theravāda commentator Dhammapala, who says it is equivalent to the above list of ten.\n\nIn the \"Ten Stages Sutra\", four more pāramitās are listed:\n\nAccording to the perspective of Tibetan Buddhism, Mahāyāna practitioners have the choice of two practice paths: the path of perfection (Sanskrit: \"pāramitāyāna\") or the path of tantra (Sanskrit: \"tantrayāna\"), which is the Vajrayāna.\n\nTraleg Kyabgon Rinpoche renders \"pāramitā\" into English as \"transcendent action\" and then frames and qualifies it:\nThe pure illusory body is said to be endowed with the six perfections (Sanskrit: \"ṣatpāramitā\").\n\nThe first four perfections are skillful means practice while the last two are wisdom practice. These contain all the methods and skills required for eliminating delusion and fulfilling other's needs. Also, leading from happy to happier states.\n\n\n\n"}

This is slightly different from traditional methods which synchronize the sender's with the receiver's clock.\n\nRBS allows nodes to synchronize their clocks to the resolution necessary for example for wireless sensor network applications. Rather than broadcasting a time stamp in a synchronization packet as in protocols such as , RBS allows the nodes receiving the synchronization packets to use the packet’s time of arrival as a reference point for clock synchronization. Because most of the non-deterministic propagation time involved in transmitting a packet over a wireless channel lies between construction of the packet and the sender’s transceiver (e.g., sender’s queue delay, MAC contention delay, etc.), RBS removes most delay uncertainty involved in typical time synchronization protocols. For single-hop networks, the RBS algorithm is very simple. First, a transmitter broadcasts some number M as reference broadcasts. Each receiver that receives these broadcasts exchanges the time that each reference broadcast was received locally with its neighbors. Nodes then calculate phase shifts relative to each other as the average of the difference of the time stamps of the node’s local clocks for the M reference broadcasts. In multihop networks, time synchronization can be performed hop by hop between two nodes as long as the nodes on each link along the path have a common node whose reference broadcasts they can synchronize to.\n\n"}

The originators of the theory, Joshua Price and Zoie MacDougall, demonstrated robotic expressionism in practice for the first time at the 2012 International RoboGames in a competition to create a robot artist. As opposed to the traditional forms of precision and randomized robotic artwork, robotic expressionists embraces the \"mood\" of the robot – the state of its environment, internal stresses, battery level, and other factors – to create an art piece with creative contributions from both the human roboticist and the robot painter.\n\nWhile robotic expressionism may have existed in undocumented forms before them, Price and MacDougall are credited with being the first roboticists to publicly display art that aligned with the theory of robotic expressionism. They began work on their first robot artist, named RobART, in the Spring of 2012. RobART was composed primarily of VEX Robotics components and had several appendages holding paint brushes, foam brushes, a foam stamp, and spray paint cans. RobART painted on the ground and moved around on its paintings with twelve wheels; it was programmed using the RobotC language.\n\nPrice and MacDougall entered RobART into the ArtBot – Paint category 2012 International RoboGames competition, which is hosted in annually in San Mateo, California. Robogames is the world's largest adult robotics competition and is often called the \"Olympics of robots\". RobART painted several pieces live for audiences at the competition. All of the robot's paintings were abstract takes on a polluted cityscape, the most well-known titled \"City No. 3\". Price and MacDougall were awarded the gold medal in the ArtBot – Paint category for their work.\n\nPrice and MacDougall were subsequently invited to the Dublin branch of the Alameda County Library to demonstrate RobART in action. The library then put one of RobART's paintings – titled \"City No. 4\" – on public display as an innovative art piece.\n\nThe theory of robotic expressionism involves concepts of programming, mechanical devices, and art theory. A primary concern in programming physical machines is keeping movement error within a certain tolerance; much research has gone into controlling physical devices to be precise when following directions. Robotic expressionists abandon this notion of robotic precision and embrace the intrinsic unpredictability in the movement on machines. By allowing for physical variability, robotic expressionists are able to explore the robot's \"mood\". Some of the largest contributors to a robot's mood are its battery power, the strength of its motors, the temperature of its environment, its internal structure, and the material of the surface on which it moves.\n\nThe interaction between human ideas and robot mood are central to the theory of robotic expressionism. The human gives the robot a program, which for the purpose of robotic expressionism can be considered an idea or a suggestion. The robot then reads the program and follows it based on its mood; a robot's mood is different each time it paints, so it will create a different work of art even when following the same program.\n"}
{"id": "25269475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25269475", "title": "Sense data", "text": "Sense data\n\nIn the philosophy of perception, the theory of sense data was a popular view held in the early 20th century by philosophers such as Bertrand Russell, C. D. Broad, H. H. Price, A. J. Ayer, and G. E. Moore. Sense data are taken to be mind-dependent objects whose existence and properties are known directly to us in perception. These objects are unanalyzed experiences inside the mind, which appear to subsequent more advanced mental operations exactly as they are.\n\nSense data are often placed in a time and/or causality series, such that they occur after the potential unreliability of our perceptual systems yet before the possibility of error during higher-level conceptual analysis and are thus incorrigible. They are thus distinct from the 'real' objects in the world outside the mind, about whose existence and properties we often \"can\" be mistaken.\n\nTalk of sense-data has since been largely replaced by talk of the closely related qualia. The formulation \"the given\" is also closely related. None of these terms has a single coherent and widely agreed-upon definition, so their exact relationships are unclear. One of the greatest troubling aspects to 20th century theories of sense data is its unclear rubric nature.\n\nBertrand Russell heard the sound of his knuckles rapping his writing table, felt the table's hardness and saw its apparent colour (which he knew 'really' to be the brown of wood) change significantly under shifting lighting conditions.\n\nH. H. Price found that although he was able to doubt the presence of a tomato before him, he was unable to doubt the existence of his red, round and 'somewhat bulgy' sense-datum and his consciousness of this sense-datum.\n\nWhen we twist a coin it 'appears' to us as elliptical. This elliptical 'appearance' cannot be identical with the coin (for the coin is perfectly round), and is therefore a sense datum, which somehow represents the round coin to us.\n\nConsider a reflection which appears to us in a mirror. There is nothing corresponding to the reflection in the world external to the mind (for our reflection appears to us as the image of a human being apparently located inside a wall, or a wardrobe). The appearance is therefore a mental object, a sense datum.\n\nThe idea that our perceptions are based on sense data is supported by a number of arguments. The first is popularly known as the argument from illusion. From a subjective experience of perceiving something, it is theoretically impossible to distinguish perceiving something which exists independently of oneself from an hallucination or mirage. Thus, we do not have any direct access to the outside world that would allow us to reliably distinguish it from an illusion that caused identical experiences. Since (the argument claims) we must have direct access to some specific experiential entity in order to have the percepts that we do, and since this entity is not identical to the real object itself, there must be some sort of internal mental entity somehow correlated to the real world, about which we afterwards have perceptions, make judgments, etc. This entity is a sense-datum.\n\nAbstract sense data is sense data without human judgement, sense data without human conception and yet evident to the senses, found in aesthetic experience. As opposed to; imaginary sense data which is more like a quasi substance and does not really exist; Imaginary sense data is abstract sense data as presented from the aestheticized senses to consciousness; i.e. imagination, power of reason and inner subjective states of self-awareness including: emotion, self-reflection, ego, and theory. The theory of abstract and imaginary sense data operates on the tacit definition of imagination as \"a power mediating between the senses and the reason by virtue of representing perceptual objects without their presence\". Imaginary sense data are 'imaginary' per Immanuel Kant's analysis that imagination is the primary faculty of mind capable of synthesizing input from the senses into a world of objects. Abstract and imaginary sense data are key to understanding abstract art's relationship with the conscious and unconscious mind.\n\nSense data theories have been criticised by philosophers such as J. L. Austin and Wilfrid Sellars (Sellars diagnosing in them The Myth of the Given), and more recently by Kevin O'Regan, Alva Noë and Daniel Dennett. Much of the early criticism may arise from a claim about sense data that was held by philosophers such as A. J. Ayer. This was that sense data really do have the properties they appear to have. Thus, in this account of sense data, the sense data that are responsible for the experience of a red tomato really \"are red\".\n\nIn one sense this is ridiculous, since there is nothing red in a brain to act as a sense datum. However, in another sense it is perfectly consistent—in the sense that the data \"are red\" when experienced directly, even though the physical processes of perception may not appear red if they were experienced in a contrived and inappropriately indirect way, such as by examining the brain of the experiencer with scientific instruments.\n\nOn some theories, the tomato itself is not red except in the eyes of a red-seeing being. Thus when one says that a neural state is or is not 'red' without referring the judgement of redness to the owner of the neurons concerned, there is an assumption that things can have innate appearances without reference to perceivers—which is implicitly denied by the sense data theory. Thus the criticism that sense data cannot really be red is made from a position of presupposition inconsistent with a theory of sense data—so it is bound to seem to make the theory seem wrong. More recent opposition to the existence of sense data appears to be simply regression to naïve realism.\n\nBy objectifying and partially externalising a Subject's basic experiences of the world as 'sense-data', positing their necessity for perception and higher order thinking and installing them permanently between the perceiving Subject and the 'real world', sense-data theories tend towards Solipsism. Attempts to repair this must avoid both obscurantism and over-dependence on psychology (and therefore empiricism, and potentially circularity).\n\n"}

{"id": "18563988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18563988", "title": "Skandha", "text": "Skandha\n\nSkandhas (Sanskrit) or khandhas (Pāḷi) means \"heaps, aggregates, collections, groupings\". In Buddhism, it refers to the five aggregates concept that asserts five factors constitute and explain a sentient being’s mental and physical existence. The five aggregates or heaps are: form (or matter or body) (\"rupa\"), sensations (or feelings, received from form) (\"vedana\"), perceptions (\"samjna\"), mental activity or formations (\"sankhara\"), and consciousness (\"vijnana\").\n\nThe \"skandhas\" concept is in contradistinction to the idea of a unified \"being or individual\", and complements the \"anatta\" doctrine of Buddhism which asserts that all things and beings are without self. The \"anatta\" and \"five aggregates\" doctrines are part of the liberating knowledge in Buddhism, wherein one realizes that the \"being\" is merely made up of a temporary grouping of five aggregates, each of which are \"not I, and not myself\", and each of the \"skandha\" is empty, without substance.\n\nIn the Theravada tradition, suffering arises when one identifies with or clings to the aggregates. This suffering is extinguished by relinquishing attachments to aggregates. The Mahayana tradition asserts that the nature of all aggregates is intrinsically empty of independent existence.\n\n\"Skandha\" (स्कन्ध) is a Sanskrit word that means \"multitude, quantity, aggregate\", generally in the context of body, trunk, stem, empirically observed gross object or anything of bulk verifiable with senses. The term appears in the Vedic literature. The Pali equivalent word \"Khandha\" (sometimes spelled \"Kkhanda\") appears extensively in the Pali canon, where state Rhys Davids and William Stede, it means \"bulk of the body, aggregate, heap, material collected into bulk\" in one context, \"all that is comprised under, groupings\" in some contexts, and particularly as \"the elements or substrata of sensory existence, sensorial aggregates which condition the appearance of life in any form\".\n\nAccording to Thanissaro, the Buddha never defined a \"person\" in terms of the aggregates (Pali: \"khandha\"), but \"such a notion is expressed by some modern scholars as if it were pan-Buddhist\". He adds that almost any Buddhist meditation teacher explains it that way, as even Buddhist commentaries from about 1st century CE onwards have done. In Thanissaro's view, this is incorrect, and he suggests that \"skandha\" should be viewed as \"functions or aspects\" of a sentient being.\n\nAccording to Dalai Lama, \"skandha\" means \"heap, group, collection or aggregate\". Adrian Snodgrass asserts that the term literally means \"heap\", and the concept refers to the teaching accepted by all Buddhist schools that \"the personality is an aggregate of five constituent parts\". Paul Williams et al. translate \"skandha\" as \"heap, aggregate\", stating it refers to the explanation of the psychophysical makeup of any being. Damien Keown and Charles Prebish state \"skandha\" is \"phung po\" in Tibetan, and the terms mean \"collections or aggregates or bundles\", and in the context of canonical Buddhism the concept asserts that \"the notion of a self is unnecessarily superimposed upon five skandha\" of a phenomenon or a living being.\n\nJohannes Bronkhorst renders \"skandha\" as \"aggregates\", stating that the meaning and importance of the concept is in explaining the non-self concept in Buddhism. The Buddhist texts assert the five aggregates are what there is to a person and personality, and in each \"skandha\" – body, sensations, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness – there is emptiness and no substance.\n\nThe Buddha teaches in the Pali Canon the five aggregates as follows:\n\nThe initial part of the Buddhist practice is purification of each of the above \"five aggregates\" through meditation, study, ritual and living by virtues, particularly abstaining from mental intoxicants. Ultimately, the practice shifts to considering these as naive, then transcending them to reach the state of realization that there is neither person nor self within, or in any other being, states Harvey, where everyone and everything is without self or substantiality and is a \"cluster of changing physical and mental processes\". David Kalupahana clarifies that the individual is considered unreal but the \"skandha\" are considered real in some early Buddhist texts, but the \"skandha\" too are considered unreal and nonsubstantial in numerous other Buddhist Nikaya and Āgama texts.\n\nBhikkhu Bodhi (2000b, p. 840) states that the aggregates are linked to \"dukkha\" (suffering) in the Buddha's Four Noble Truths teaching in the following way:\n\nIn the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta the Buddha provides the classic elaboration on the first of his Four Noble Truths, \"The Truth of Suffering\" (Dukkhasacca):\nThe fourth category of \"Dukkha\" consisting of \"five bundles of grasping fuel\", states Harvey, are the \"five aggregates\" that form a person. Each aggregate is an object of grasping (clinging), at the root of self-identification as \"I, me, myself\". All five are phenomenon that formulate a sense of personality, and they trigger suffering, pain or unsatisfactoriness. Everything that makes a person is a factor of \"dukkha\", and these in Buddhist thought are not a source of pleasure but of sorrow. Nirvana requires transcendence from all five \"skandhas\" and the sense objects.\n\nEach of the five \"skandhas\" trigger clinging asserts \"\", and the delusion of identifying \"I, mine, myself\" through that \"skandha\". This clinging creates karmic imprints that lead to rebirth and more \"Dukkha\". This ceases when this clinging ceases, no more karma is being produced, and rebirth ends.\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures assert that all five skhandhas have three characteristics often called \"ti-lakkhana\" (\"tri-lakshana\", three marks). These are \"Dukkha\", \"Anicca\" (impermanence) and \"Anatta\" (non-Self).\n\nEach of the \"skandhas\" come into being and dissolve (Samsara). This is applicable to all beings and their environs, including human beings as well as beings who have reincarnated in deva (god) and naraka (hell) realms.\n\nFurther, states Buddhism, each of the \"skandhas\", a person and every being lacks a self and substantiality. This is the \"non-self\" (\"anatta\") doctrine, and it holds that a belief in self is a source of \"Dukkha\" (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).\n\nRealizing the real nature of \"skandhas\", both in terms of impermanence and non-self, is necessary for nirvana.\n\nThe Buddha taught that aggregates are appearances which don't have an essence either separately or together, all that is perceived as an aggregate or a whole has no real existence. The explicit denial of substantiality or essence in any of the five \"skandha\" appears in the early Buddhist texts:\n\nThe \"skandha\" doctrine, state Mark Siderits et al., is a form of anti-realism about everyday reality including persons, and presents an alternative to \"substantialist views of the self\". It is a Buddhist reductionism of everything perceived, each person and personality as an \"aggregate, heap\" of composite entities without essence. This 'no essence' view has been a source of sustained questions, major disagreements and commentaries since ancient times, by non-Buddhist Indian religions, as well as within Buddhist traditions.\n\nAnother application of the \"skandha\" theory in Buddhist texts is in descriptions of the enlightened, perfected state of \"Arhat\" and \"Tathagata\". The perfect state of enlightenment is one without any personality, no \"I am\" conceit, no physical identification, no intellectual identification, no identification in direct or indirects terms related to any of the five \"skandhas\", translates Peter Harvey, because \"a tathagata has abandoned the personality factors\". The physical, the personality factors (\"skandhas\"), and any sense of Self or I are a burden which the enlightened individual has dropped, thus becoming a \"man of nothing\", not clinging to anything internal or external. No one can find him because he has no \"I\", self or identity, while his \"citta\" expands to infinity; he is beyond the reach of the unenlightened human beings, as well as the army of the \"Mara\" (demon of death in Buddhism).\n\nWhile early Buddhism reflects the teachings as found in the Pali Sutta Pitaka and the Chinese Āgama, the Early Buddhist schools developed detailed analyses and overviews of the teachings found in those sutras, called Abhidharma. Each school developed its own Abhidharma, the best known is the Theravāda Abhidhamma. The Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma has been preserved partly in the Chinese Āgama.\n\nThe Theravada tradition teaches the \"six sense bases\" theory, understood as six pairs of internal and external sense bases that accommodate \"all the factors of existence\", it is \"the all\", and \"apart from which nothing at all exists\", states Bhikkhu Bodhi. These six sense bases in the Theravada exegesis are an alternative to the five \"skandhas\", but they are corollaries of the \"skandha\" doctrine and not an innovation. In this teaching, found in texts such as \"Salayatana samyutta\", the coming together of an object and a sense-organ results in the arising of the corresponding consciousness. The suttas themselves don't describe this alternative. It is in the Abhidhamma, striving to \"a single all-inclusive system\" that the five aggregates and the six sense bases are explicitly connected.\n\nThe \"Maha-punnama Sutta\", also called \"The Great Full-moon Night Discourse\", describes the impermanence of the aggregates to assert that there is no self, and the right discernment is, \"this is not mine, this is not my self, this is not what I am\". This theme is retained in the Theravadin six sense bases exegesis, states Bhikkhu Bodhi, which sum up the conditioned existence as \"the all\" of the sense bases, and that the \"six bases are empty of a self and of what belongs to the self\".\n\nAn alternate formulation of the aggregates is in the terms of Twelve Sense Bases:\n\nBodhi states the six sense bases is a \"vertical\" view of human experiences while the aggregates is a \"horizontal\" (temporal) view. The Theravada Buddhist meditation practice on sense bases is aimed at both removing distorted cognitions such as those influenced by cravings, conceits and opinions, as well as \"uprooting all conceivings in all its guises\".\n\nThe eighteen dhātus – Six External Bases, Six Internal Bases, and Six Consciousnesses – function through the five aggregates. These dhātus can be arranged into six triads, each triad composed of a sense object, a sense organ, and sense consciousness. In regards to the aggregates:\n\nThe Abhidhamma and post-canonical Pali texts create a meta-scheme for the Sutta Pitaka's conceptions of aggregates, sense bases and dhattus (elements). This meta-scheme is known as the four \"paramatthas\" or ultimate realities.\n\nThere are four paramatthas; three conditioned, one unconditioned:\n\nThe mapping between the aggregates, the twelve sense bases, and the ultimate realities is represented in this chart:\n\nThe Twelve Nidanas describe twelve phenomenal links by which suffering is perpetuated between and within lives.\n\nEmbedded within this model, four of the five aggregates are explicitly mentioned in the following sequence:\n\nThe interplay between the five-aggregate model of immediate causation and the twelve-nidana model of requisite conditioning is evident, for instance underlining the seminal role that mental formations have in both the origination and cessation of suffering.\n\nAccording to Hans Wolfgang Schumann, the nidānas are a later synthesis of Buddhist teachings meant to make them more comprehensible. Comparison with the five skandhas shows that the chain contains logical inconsistencies, which can be explained when the chain is considered to be a later elaboration. This way it is explainable that nāma-rūpa in consciousness in the nine-fold are the beginning or start, while in the twelve-fold chain they are preceded by ignorance and formations. Those can only exist when \"nāma-rūpa\" in consciousness are present.\nSchumann also proposes that the twelve-fold is extended over three existences, and illustrates the succession of rebirths. While Buddhaghosa in Vasubandhu maintains a 2-8-2 schema, Schumann maintains a 3-6-3 scheme, putting the five skandhas alongside the twelve nidānas.\n\nThe Mahayana developed out of the traditional schools, introducing new texts and putting other emphases in the teachings, especially sunyata and the Bodhisattva-ideal.\n\nThe Prajnaparamita-teachings developed from the first century BCE onward. It emphasises the \"emptiness\" of everything that exists. This means that there are no eternally existing \"essences\", since everything is dependently originated. The skandhas too are dependently originated, and lack any substantial existence .\n\nThis is famously stated in the Heart Sutra. The Sanskrit version of the classic \"Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra\" (\"Heart Sutra\") states:\n\nThe Madhyaka-school elaborates on the notion of the middle way. Its basic text is the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, written by Nagarjuna, who refuted the Sarvastivada conception of reality, which reifies dhammas. The simultaneous non-reification of the self and reification of the skandhas has been viewed by some Buddhist thinkers as highly problematic.\n\nThe Yogacara-school further analysed the workings of the mind, elaborated on the concept of nama-rupa and the five skandhas, and developed the notion of the Eight Consciousnesses.\n\nSunyata, in Chinese texts, is \"wu\", \"nothingness\". In these texts, the relation between absolute and relative was a central topic in understanding the Buddhist teachings. The aggregates convey the relative (or conventional) experience of the world by an individual, although Absolute truth is realized through them.\n\nCommenting on the Heart Sutra, D.T. Suzuki notes:\nThe Tathāgatagarbha Sutras, which developed in India, played a prominent role in China. The tathagatagarbha-sutras, on occasion, speak of the ineffable skandhas of the Buddha (beyond the nature of worldly skandhas and beyond worldly understanding). In the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Buddha tells of how the Buddha's skandhas are in fact eternal and unchanging. The Buddha's skandhas are said to be incomprehensible to unawakened vision.\n\nThe Vajrayana tradition further develops the aggregates in terms of mahamudra epistemology and tantric reifications.\n\nReferring to mahamudra teachings, Chogyam Trungpa identifies the form aggregate as the \"solidification\" of ignorance (Pali, \"avijja\"; Skt., \"avidya\"), allowing one to have the illusion of \"possessing\" ever dynamic and spacious wisdom (Pali, \"vijja\"; Skt. \"vidya\"), and thus being the basis for the creation of a dualistic relationship between \"self\" and \"other.\"\n\nAccording to Trungpa Rinpoche, the five skandhas are \"a set of Buddhist concepts which describe experience as a five-step process\" and that \"the whole development of the five skandhas...is an attempt on our part to shield ourselves from the truth of our insubstantiality,\" while \"the practice of meditation is to see the transparency of this shield.\" \n\nTrungpa Rinpoche writes (2001, p. 38):\nThe use of the \"skandhas\" concept to explain the self is unique to Buddhism among major Indian religions. It contrasts with the premise of Hinduism and Jainism that a living being has an eternal soul or metaphysical self.\n\nMiri Albahari objects to the usual understanding of the skandhas as denoting the absence of any \"self.\" Albahari has argued that the \"khandhas\" do not necessarily constitute the entirety of the human experience, and that the Hindu concept of Ātman (eternal soul) is not explicitly negated by Pāli Canon. According to Albani, \"anattā is best understood as a practical strategy rather than as a metaphysical doctrine.\" To Albahari, \"Nibbāna\" is an ever-present part of human nature, which is gradually \"uncovered\" by the cessation of ignorance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The field of social dynamics brings together ideas from Economics, Sociology, Social Psychology, and other disciplines, and is a sub-field of complex adaptive systems or complexity science. The fundamental assumption of the field is that individuals are influenced by one another's behavior. The field is closely related to system dynamics. Like system dynamics, social dynamics is concerned with changes over time and emphasizes the role of feedbacks. However, in social dynamics individual choices and interactions are typically viewed as the source of aggregate level behavior, while system dynamics posits that the structure of feedbacks and accumulations are responsible for system level dynamics. Research in the field typically takes a behavioral approach, assuming that individuals are boundedly rational and act on local information. Mathematical and computational modeling are important tools for studying social dynamics. Because social dynamics focuses on individual level behavior, and recognizes the importance of heterogeneity across individuals, strict analytic results are often impossible. Instead, approximation techniques, such as mean field approximations from statistical physics, or computer simulations are used to understand the behaviors of the system. In contrast to more traditional approaches in economics, scholars of social dynamics are often interested in non-equilibrium, or dynamic, behavior. That is, behavior that changes over time.\n\n\nAvailable online: http://www.hindawi.com/GetArticle.aspx?doi=10.1155/S1026022697000101.\n\n\n"}

The venue is usually a public place (e.g. a street) and the fight sometimes results in serious injury or occasionally even death.\n\nThe main difference between street fighting and a self defense situation is that a street fight is avoidable, whereas a self-defense situation is not. The other main difference is that the fight is consensual between both parties. A typical situation might involve two men arguing in a bar, then one suggests stepping outside, where the fight commences. Thus, it is often possible to avoid the fight by backing off, while in self-defense, a person is actively trying to escape the situation, using force if necessary to ensure his or her own safety.\n\nIn some martial arts communities, street fighting and self-defense are often considered synonymous.\n\n"}

The word is rarely used of oneself, but rather is applied descriptively to the behavior of other people. The person who is carrying out \"amae\" may beg or plead, or alternatively act selfishly while secure in the knowledge that the caregiver will indulge them. The behavior of children towards their parents is perhaps the most common example of \"amae\", but Doi argued that child-rearing practices in the Western world seek to stop this kind of dependence, whereas in Japan it persists into adulthood in all kinds of social relationships.\n\nDoi developed this idea to explain and describe many kinds of Japanese behavior. However, Doi states that while \"amae\" is not just a Japanese phenomenon, the Japanese are the only people known to have an extensive vocabulary for describing it. The reason for this is that \"amae\" is a major factor in Japanese interaction and customs. Doi argues that nonverbal empathic guesswork (\"sasshi\" ), a fondness for unanimous agreement in decision-making, the ambiguity and hesitation of self-expression (\"enryo\" ), and the \"tatemae–honne\" dynamics are communicative manifestations of the \"amae\" psychology of Japanese people.\nDoi translates \"amaeru\" as \"to depend and presume upon another's benevolence\". It indicates, for Doi, \"helplessness and the desire to be loved\". \"Amaeru\" can also be defined as \"to wish to be loved\", and denotes dependency needs. \"Amae\" is, in essence, a request for indulgence of one's perceived needs.\n\nDoi says,\nAccording to Doi and others, in Japan the kind of relationship based on this prototype provides a model of human relationships in general, especially (though not exclusively) when one person is senior to another. As another writer puts it:\n\"Amae\" may also be used to describe the behavior of a husband who comes home drunk and depends on his wife to get him ready for bed. In Japan, \"amae\" does have a connotation of immaturity, but it is also recognized as a key ingredient in loving relationships, perhaps more so than the notions of romance so common in the West.\n\nDoi's work has been heavily criticized by academics specializing in nihonjinron studies as being anecdotal and full of inaccuracies.

Koshland in 2002 in order to create a universal definition of life. One stated goal of this universal definition is to aid in understanding and identifying artificial and extraterrestrial life. The seven pillars are Program, Improvisation, Compartmentalization, Energy, Regeneration, Adaptability, and Seclusion. These can be abbreviated as PICERAS.\n\nKoshland defines \"Program\" as an \"organized plan that describes both the ingredients themselves and the kinetics of the interactions among ingredients as the living system persists through time.\" In natural life as it is known on Earth, the program operates through the mechanisms of nucleic acids and amino acids, but the concept of program can apply to other imagined or undiscovered mechanisms.\n\n\"Improvisation\" refers to the living system's ability to change its program in response to the larger environment in which it exists. An example of improvisation on earth is natural selection.\n\n\"Compartmentalization\" refers to the separation of spaces in the living system that allow for separate environments for necessary chemical processes. Compartmentalization is necessary to protect the concentration of the ingredients for a reaction from outside environments.\n\nBecause living systems involve net movement in terms of chemical movement or body movement, and lose energy in those movements through entropy, energy is required for a living system to exist. The main source of energy on Earth is the sun, but other sources of energy exist for life on Earth, such as hydrogen gas or methane, used in chemosynthesis.\n\n\"Regeneration\" in a living system refers to the general compensation for losses and degradation in the various components and processes in the system. This covers the thermodynamic loss in chemical reactions, the wear and tear of larger parts, and the larger decline of components of the system in ageing. Living systems replace these losses by importing molecules from the outside environment, synthesizing new molecules and components, or creating new generations to start the system over again.\n\n\"Adaptability\" is the ability of a living system to respond to needs, dangers, or changes. It is distinguished from improvisation because the response is timely and does not involve a change of the program. Adaptability occurs from a molecular level to a behavioral level through feedback and feedforward systems. For example, an animal seeing a predator will respond to the danger with hormonal changes and escape behavior.\n\nY. N. Zhuravlev and V. A. Avetisov have analyzed Koshland's seven pillars from the context of primordial life and, though calling the concept \"elegant,\" point out that the pillars of compartmentalization, program, and seclusion don't apply well to the non-differentiated earliest life.\n\n"}
{"id": "199701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199701", "title": "Type system", "text": "Type system\n\nIn programming languages, a type system is a set of rules that assigns a property called type to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions or modules. These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types, data structures, or other components (e.g. \"string\", \"array of float\", \"function returning boolean\"). The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or as a combination of static and dynamic checking. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing business rules, enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for multiple dispatch, providing a form of documentation, etc.\n\nA type system associates a type with each computed value and, by examining the flow of these values, attempts to ensure or prove that no type errors can occur. The given type system in question determines exactly what constitutes a type error, but in general the aim is to prevent operations expecting a certain kind of value from being used with values for which that operation does not make sense (logic errors). Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages, and built into the interpreters and compilers for them; although the type system of a language can be extended by optional tools that perform added kinds of checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar.\n\nAn example of a simple type system is that of the C language. The portions of a C program are the function definitions. One function is invoked by another function. The interface of a function states the name of the function and a list of values that are passed to the function's code. The code of an invoking function states the name of the invoked, along with the names of variables that hold values to pass to it. During execution, the values are placed into temporary storage, then execution jumps to the code of the invoked function. The invoked function's code accesses the values and makes use of them. If the instructions inside the function are written with the assumption of receiving an integer value, but the calling code passed a floating-point value, then the wrong result will be computed by the invoked function. The C compiler checks the type declared for each variable sent, against the type declared for each variable in the interface of the invoked function. If the types do not match, the compiler throws a compile-time error.\n\nA compiler may also use the static type of a value to optimize the storage it needs and the choice of algorithms for operations on the value. In many C compilers the \"float\" data type, for example, is represented in 32 bits, in accord with the IEEE specification for single-precision floating point numbers. They will thus use floating-point-specific microprocessor operations on those values (floating-point addition, multiplication, etc.).\n\nThe depth of type constraints and the manner of their evaluation affect the \"typing\" of the language. A programming language may further associate an operation with various resolutions for each type, in the case of type polymorphism. Type theory is the study of type systems. The concrete types of some programming languages, such as integers and strings, depend on practical issues of computer architecture, compiler implementation, and language design.\n\nFormally, type theory studies type systems. A programming language must have occurrence to type check using the \"type system\" whether at compile time or runtime, manually annotated or automatically inferred. As Mark Manasse concisely put it:\nAssigning a data type, termed \"typing\", gives meaning to a sequence of bits such as a value in memory or some object such as a variable. The hardware of a general purpose computer is unable to discriminate between for example a memory address and an instruction code, or between a character, an integer, or a floating-point number, because it makes no intrinsic distinction between any of the possible values that a sequence of bits might \"mean\". Associating a sequence of bits with a type conveys that meaning to the programmable hardware to form a \"symbolic system\" composed of that hardware and some program.\n\nA program associates each value with at least one specific type, but it also can occur that one value is associated with many subtypes. Other entities, such as objects, modules, communication channels, and dependencies can become associated with a type. Even a type can become associated with a type. An implementation of a \"type system\" could in theory associate identifications called \"data type\" (a type of a value), \"class\" (a type of an object), and \"kind\" (a \"type of a type\", or metatype). These are the abstractions that typing can go through, on a hierarchy of levels contained in a system.\n\nWhen a programming language evolves a more elaborate type system, it gains a more finely grained rule set than basic type checking, but this comes at a price when the type inferences (and other properties) become undecidable, and when more attention must be paid by the programmer to annotate code or to consider computer-related operations and functioning. It is challenging to find a sufficiently expressive type system that satisfies all programming practices in a type safe manner.\n\nThe more type restrictions that are imposed by the compiler, the more \"strongly typed\" a programming language is. Strongly typed languages often require the programmer to make explicit conversions in contexts where an implicit conversion would cause no harm. Pascal's type system has been described as \"too strong\" because, for example, the size of an array or string is part of its type, making some programming tasks difficult. Haskell is also strongly typed but its types are automatically inferred so that explicit conversions are often (but not always) unnecessary.\n\nA programming language compiler can also implement a \"dependent type\" or an \"effect system\", which enables even more program specifications to be verified by a type checker. Beyond simple value-type pairs, a virtual \"region\" of code is associated with an \"effect\" component describing \"what\" is being done \"with what\", and enabling for example to \"throw\" an error report. Thus the symbolic system may be a \"type and effect system\", which endows it with more safety checking than type checking alone.\nWhether automated by the compiler or specified by a programmer, a type system makes program behavior illegal if outside the type-system rules. Advantages provided by programmer-specified type systems include:\n\nAdvantages provided by compiler-specified type systems include:\n\nA type error is an unintended condition which might manifest in multiple stages of a program's development. Thus a facility for detection of the error is needed in the type system. In some languages, such as Haskell, for which type inference is automated, lint might be available to its compiler to aid in the detection of error.\n\nType safety contributes to program correctness, but might only guarantee correctness at the cost of making the type checking itself an undecidable problem. In a \"type system\" with automated type checking a program may prove to run incorrectly yet be safely typed, and produce no compiler errors. Division by zero is an unsafe and incorrect operation, but a type checker running at compile time only does not scan for division by zero in most languages, and then it is left as a runtime error. To prove the absence of these more-general-than-types defects, other kinds of formal methods, collectively known as program analyses, are in common use. Alternatively, a sufficiently expressive type system, such as in dependently typed languages, can prevent these kinds of errors (for example, expressing \"the type of non-zero numbers\"). In addition software testing is an empirical method for finding errors that the type checker cannot detect.\n\nThe process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types—\"type checking\"—may occur either at compile-time (a static check) or at run-time. If a language specification requires its typing rules strongly (i.e., more or less allowing only those automatic type conversions that do not lose information), one can refer to the process as \"strongly typed\", if not, as \"weakly typed\". The terms are not usually used in a strict sense.\n\nStatic type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program based on analysis of a program's text (source code). If a program passes a static type checker, then the program is guaranteed to satisfy some set of type safety properties for all possible inputs.\n\nStatic type checking can be considered a limited form of program verification (see type safety), and in a type-safe language, can be considered also an optimization. If a compiler can prove that a program is well-typed, then it does not need to emit dynamic safety checks, allowing the resulting compiled binary to run faster and to be smaller.\n\nStatic type checking for Turing-complete languages is inherently conservative. That is, if a type system is both \"sound\" (meaning that it rejects all incorrect programs) and \"decidable\" (meaning that it is possible to write an algorithm that determines whether a program is well-typed), then it must be \"incomplete\" (meaning there are correct programs, which are also rejected, even though they do not encounter runtime errors). For example, consider a program containing the code:\n\ncodice_2\n\nEven if the expression codice_3 always evaluates to codice_4 at run-time, most type checkers will reject the program as ill-typed, because it is difficult (if not impossible) for a static analyzer to determine that the codice_5 branch will not be taken. Conversely, a static type checker will quickly detect type errors in rarely used code paths. Without static type checking, even code coverage tests with 100% coverage may be unable to find such type errors. The tests may fail to detect such type errors, because the combination of all places where values are created and all places where a certain value is used must be taken into account.\n\nA number of useful and common programming language features cannot be checked statically, such as downcasting. Thus, many languages will have both static and dynamic type checking; the static type checker verifies what it can, and dynamic checks verify the rest.\n\nMany languages with static type checking provide a way to bypass the type checker. Some languages allow programmers to choose between static and dynamic type safety. For example, C# distinguishes between \"statically-typed\" and \"dynamically-typed\" variables. Uses of the former are checked statically, whereas uses of the latter are checked dynamically. Other languages allow writing code that is not type-safe; for example, in C, programmers can freely cast a value between any two types that have the same size, effectively subverting the type concept.\n\nFor a list of languages with static type checking, see .\n\nDynamic type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program at runtime. Implementations of dynamically type-checked languages generally associate each runtime object with a \"type tag\" (i.e., a reference to a type) containing its type information. This runtime type information (RTTI) can also be used to implement dynamic dispatch, late binding, downcasting, reflection, and similar features.\n\nMost type-safe languages include some form of dynamic type checking, even if they also have a static type checker. The reason for this is that many useful features or properties are difficult or impossible to verify statically. For example, suppose that a program defines two types, A and B, where B is a subtype of A. If the program tries to convert a value of type A to type B, which is known as downcasting, then the operation is legal only if the value being converted is actually a value of type B. Thus, a dynamic check is needed to verify that the operation is safe. This requirement is one of the criticisms of downcasting.\n\nBy definition, dynamic type checking may cause a program to fail at runtime. In some programming languages, it is possible to anticipate and recover from these failures. In others, type-checking errors are considered fatal.\n\nProgramming languages that include dynamic type checking but not static type checking are often called \"dynamically typed programming languages\". For a list of such languages, see .\n\nSome languages allow both static and dynamic typing (type checking), sometimes called \"soft\" typing. For example, Java and some other ostensibly statically typed languages support downcasting types to their subtypes, querying an object to discover its dynamic type, and other type operations that depend on runtime type information. More generally, most programming languages include mechanisms for dispatching over different 'kinds' of data, such as disjoint unions, subtype polymorphism, and variant types. Even when not interacting with type annotations or type checking, such mechanisms are materially similar to dynamic typing implementations. See programming language for more discussion of the interactions between static and dynamic typing.\n\nObjects in object-oriented languages are usually accessed by a reference whose static target type (or manifest type) is equal to either the object's run-time type (its latent type) or a supertype thereof. This is conformant with the Liskov substitution principle, which states that all operations performed on an instance of a given type can also be performed on an instance of a subtype. This concept is also known as subsumption. In some languages subtypes may also possess covariant or contravariant return types and argument types respectively.\n\nCertain languages, for example Clojure, Common Lisp, or Cython are dynamically type-checked by default, but allow programs to opt into static type checking by providing optional annotations. One reason to use such hints would be to optimize the performance of critical sections of a program. This is formalized by gradual typing. The programming environment \"DrRacket\", a pedagogic environment based on Lisp, and a precursor of the language Racket was also soft-typed.\n\nConversely, as of version 4.0, the C# language provides a way to indicate that a variable should not be statically type-checked. A variable whose type is codice_6 will not be subject to static type checking. Instead, the program relies on runtime type information to determine how the variable may be used.\n\nThe choice between static and dynamic typing requires certain trade-offs.\n\nStatic typing can find type errors reliably at compile time, which should increase the reliability of the delivered program. However, programmers disagree over how commonly type errors occur, resulting in further disagreements over the proportion of those bugs that are coded that would be caught by appropriately representing the designed types in code. Static typing advocates believe programs are more reliable when they have been well type-checked, whereas dynamic-typing advocates point to distributed code that has proven reliable and to small bug databases. The value of static typing, then, presumably increases as the strength of the type system is increased. Advocates of dependent typing, implemented in languages such as Dependent ML and Epigram, have suggested that almost all bugs can be considered type errors, if the types used in a program are properly declared by the programmer or correctly inferred by the compiler.\n\nStatic typing usually results in compiled code that executes faster. When the compiler knows the exact data types that are in use (which is necessary for static verification, either through declaration or inference) it can produce optimized machine code. Some dynamically typed languages such as Common Lisp allow optional type declarations for optimization for this reason.\n\nBy contrast, dynamic typing may allow compilers to run faster and interpreters to dynamically load new code, because changes to source code in dynamically typed languages may result in less checking to perform and less code to revisit. This too may reduce the edit-compile-test-debug cycle.\n\nStatically typed languages that lack type inference (such as C and Java prior to version 10) require that programmers declare the types that a method or function must use. This can serve as added program documentation, that is active and dynamic, instead of static. This allows a compiler to prevent it from drifting out of synchrony, and from being ignored by programmers. However, a language can be statically typed without requiring type declarations (examples include Haskell, Scala, OCaml, F#, and to a lesser extent C# and C++), so explicit type declaration is not a necessary requirement for static typing in all languages.\n\nDynamic typing allows constructs that some static type checking would reject as illegal. For example, \"eval\" functions, which execute arbitrary data as code, become possible. An \"eval\" function is possible with static typing, but requires advanced uses of algebraic data types. Further, dynamic typing better accommodates transitional code and prototyping, such as allowing a placeholder data structure (mock object) to be transparently used in place of a full data structure (usually for the purposes of experimentation and testing).\n\nDynamic typing typically allows duck typing (which enables easier code reuse). Many languages with static typing also feature duck typing or other mechanisms like generic programming that also enable easier code reuse.\n\nDynamic typing typically makes metaprogramming easier to use. For example, C++ templates are typically more cumbersome to write than the equivalent Ruby or Python code since C++ has stronger rules regarding type definitions (for both functions and variables). This forces a developer to write more boilerplate code for a template than a Python developer would need to. More advanced run-time constructs such as metaclasses and introspection are often harder to use in statically typed languages. In some languages, such features may also be used e.g. to generate new types and behaviors on the fly, based on run-time data. Such advanced constructs are often provided by dynamic programming languages; many of these are dynamically typed, although \"dynamic typing\" need not be related to \"dynamic programming languages\".\n\nLanguages are often colloquially referred to as \"strongly typed\" or \"weakly typed\". In fact, there is no universally accepted definition of what these terms mean. In general, there are more precise terms to represent the differences between type systems that lead people to call them \"strong\" or \"weak\".\n\nA third way of categorizing the type system of a programming language uses the safety of typed operations and conversions. Computer scientists consider a language \"type-safe\" if it does not allow operations or conversions that violate the rules of the type system.\n\nSome observers use the term \"memory-safe language\" (or just \"safe language\") to describe languages that do not allow programs to access memory that has not been assigned for their use. For example, a memory-safe language will check array bounds, or else statically guarantee (i.e., at compile time before execution) that array accesses out of the array boundaries will cause compile-time and perhaps runtime errors.\n\nConsider the following program of a language that is both type-safe and memory-safe:\n\nIn this example, the variable will have the value 42. Although this may not be what the programmer anticipated, it is a well-defined result. If were a different string, one that could not be converted to a number (e.g. \"Hello World\"), the result would be well-defined as well. Note that a program can be type-safe or memory-safe and still crash on an invalid operation; in fact, if a program encounters an operation that is not type-safe, terminating the program is often the only option.\n\nNow consider a similar example in C:\n\nIn this example will point to a memory address five characters beyond , equivalent to three characters after the terminating zero character of the string pointed to by . This is memory that the program is not expected to access. It may contain garbage data, and it certainly doesn't contain anything useful. As this example shows, C is neither a memory-safe nor a type-safe language.\n\nIn general, type-safety and memory-safety go hand in hand. For example, a language that supports pointer arithmetic and number-to-pointer conversions (like C) is neither memory-safe nor type-safe, because it allows arbitrary memory to be accessed as if it were valid memory of any type.\n\nFor more information, see memory safety.\n\nSome languages allow different levels of checking to apply to different regions of code. Examples include:\n\nAdditional tools such as lint and IBM Rational Purify can also be used to achieve a higher level of strictness.\n\nIt has been proposed, chiefly by Gilad Bracha, that the choice of type system be made independent of choice of language; that a type system should be a module that can be \"plugged\" into a language as needed. He believes this is advantageous, because what he calls mandatory type systems make languages less expressive and code more fragile. The requirement that types do not affect the semantics of the language is difficult to fulfill.\n\nOptional typing is related to gradual typing, but still distinct from it.\n\nThe term \"polymorphism\" refers to the ability of code (especially, functions or classes) to act on values of multiple types, or to the ability of different instances of the same data structure to contain elements of different types. Type systems that allow polymorphism generally do so in order to improve the potential for code re-use: in a language with polymorphism, programmers need only implement a data structure such as a list or an associative array once, rather than once for each type of element with which they plan to use it. For this reason computer scientists sometimes call the use of certain forms of polymorphism \"generic programming\". The type-theoretic foundations of polymorphism are closely related to those of abstraction, modularity and (in some cases) subtyping.\n\nIn \"duck typing\", a statement calling a method codice_11 on an object does not rely on the declared type of the object; only that the object, of whatever type, must supply an implementation of the method called, when called, at run-time.\n\nDuck typing differs from structural typing in that, if the \"part\" (of the whole module structure) needed for a given local computation is present \"at runtime\", the duck type system is satisfied in its type identity analysis. On the other hand, a structural type system would require the analysis of the whole module structure at compile time to determine type identity or type dependence.\n\nDuck typing differs from a nominative type system in a number of aspects. The most prominent ones are that for duck typing, type information is determined at runtime (as contrasted to compile time), and the name of the type is irrelevant to determine type identity or type dependence; only partial structure information is required for that for a given point in the program execution.\n\nDuck typing uses the premise that (referring to a value) \"if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck\" (this is a reference to the duck test that is attributed to James Whitcomb Riley). The term may have been coined by Alex Martelli in a 2000 message to the comp.lang.python newsgroup (see Python).\n\nWhile one controlled experiment showed an increase in developer productivity for duck typing in single developer projects, other controlled experiments on API usability show the opposite.\n\nMany type systems have been created that are specialized for use in certain environments with certain types of data, or for out-of-band static program analysis. Frequently, these are based on ideas from formal type theory and are only available as part of prototype research systems.\n\nDependent types are based on the idea of using scalars or values to more precisely describe the type of some other value. For example, formula_1 might be the type of a formula_2 matrix. We can then define typing rules such as the following rule for matrix multiplication:\n\nformula_3\n\nwhere formula_4, formula_5, formula_6 are arbitrary positive integer values. A variant of ML called Dependent ML has been created based on this type system, but because type checking for conventional dependent types is undecidable, not all programs using them can be type-checked without some kind of limits. Dependent ML limits the sort of equality it can decide to Presburger arithmetic.\n\nOther languages such as Epigram make the value of all expressions in the language decidable so that type checking can be decidable. However, in general proof of decidability is undecidable, so many programs require hand-written annotations that may be very non-trivial. As this impedes the development process, many language implementations provide an easy way out in the form of an option to disable this condition. This, however, comes at the cost of making the type-checker run in an infinite loop when fed programs that do not type-check, causing the compilation to fail.\n\nLinear types, based on the theory of linear logic, and closely related to uniqueness types, are types assigned to values having the property that they have one and only one reference to them at all times. These are valuable for describing large immutable values such as files, strings, and so on, because any operation that simultaneously destroys a linear object and creates a similar object (such as 'codice_12') can be optimized \"under the hood\" into an in-place mutation. Normally this is not possible, as such mutations could cause side effects on parts of the program holding other references to the object, violating referential transparency. They are also used in the prototype operating system Singularity for interprocess communication, statically ensuring that processes cannot share objects in shared memory in order to prevent race conditions. The Clean language (a Haskell-like language) uses this type system in order to gain a lot of speed (compared to performing a deep copy) while remaining safe.\n\nIntersection types are types describing values that belong to \"both\" of two other given types with overlapping value sets. For example, in most implementations of C the signed char has range -128 to 127 and the unsigned char has range 0 to 255, so the intersection type of these two types would have range 0 to 127. Such an intersection type could be safely passed into functions expecting \"either\" signed or unsigned chars, because it is compatible with both types.\n\nIntersection types are useful for describing overloaded function types: For example, if \" → \" is the type of functions taking an integer argument and returning an integer, and \" → \" is the type of functions taking a float argument and returning a float, then the intersection of these two types can be used to describe functions that do one or the other, based on what type of input they are given. Such a function could be passed into another function expecting an \" → \" function safely; it simply would not use the \" → \" functionality.\n\nIn a subclassing hierarchy, the intersection of a type and an ancestor type (such as its parent) is the most derived type. The intersection of sibling types is empty.\n\nThe Forsythe language includes a general implementation of intersection types. A restricted form is refinement types.\n\nUnion types are types describing values that belong to \"either\" of two types. For example, in C, the signed char has a -128 to 127 range, and the unsigned char has a 0 to 255 range, so the union of these two types would have an overall \"virtual\" range of -128 to 255 that may be used partially depending on which union member is accessed. Any function handling this union type would have to deal with integers in this complete range. More generally, the only valid operations on a union type are operations that are valid on \"both\" types being unioned. C's \"union\" concept is similar to union types, but is not typesafe, as it permits operations that are valid on \"either\" type, rather than \"both\". Union types are important in program analysis, where they are used to represent symbolic values whose exact nature (e.g., value or type) is not known.\n\nIn a subclassing hierarchy, the union of a type and an ancestor type (such as its parent) is the ancestor type. The union of sibling types is a subtype of their common ancestor (that is, all operations permitted on their common ancestor are permitted on the union type, but they may also have other valid operations in common).\n\nExistential types are frequently used in connection with record types to represent modules and abstract data types, due to their ability to separate implementation from interface. For example, the type \"T = ∃X { a: X; f: (X → int); }\" describes a module interface that has a data member named \"a\" of type \"X\" and a function named \"f\" that takes a parameter of the \"same\" type \"X\" and returns an integer. This could be implemented in different ways; for example:\n\n\nThese types are both subtypes of the more general existential type T and correspond to concrete implementation types, so any value of one of these types is a value of type T. Given a value \"t\" of type \"T\", we know that \"t.f(t.a)\" is well-typed, regardless of what the abstract type \"X\" is. This gives flexibility for choosing types suited to a particular implementation while clients that use only values of the interface type—the existential type—are isolated from these choices.\n\nIn general it's impossible for the typechecker to infer which existential type a given module belongs to. In the above example intT { a: int; f: (int → int); } could also have the type ∃X { a: X; f: (int → int); }. The simplest solution is to annotate every module with its intended type, e.g.:\n\n\nAlthough abstract data types and modules had been implemented in programming languages for quite some time, it wasn't until 1988 that John C. Mitchell and Gordon Plotkin established the formal theory under the slogan: \"Abstract [data] types have existential type\". The theory is a second-order typed lambda calculus similar to System F, but with existential instead of universal quantification.\n\nGradual typing is a type system in which variables may be typed either at compile-time (which is static typing) or at run-time (which is dynamic typing), allowing software developers to choose either type paradigm as appropriate, from within a single language. In particular, gradual typing uses a special type named \"dynamic\" to represent statically-unknown types, and gradual typing replaces the notion of type equality with a new relation called \"consistency\" that relates the dynamic type to every other type. The consistency relation is symmetric but not transitive.\n\nMany static type systems, such as those of C and Java, require \"type declarations\": The programmer must explicitly associate each variable with a specific type. Others, such as Haskell's, perform \"type inference\": The compiler draws conclusions about the types of variables based on how programmers use those variables. For example, given a function that adds and together, the compiler can infer that and must be numbers – since addition is only defined for numbers. Thus, any call to elsewhere in the program that specifies a non-numeric type (such as a string or list) as an argument would signal an error.\n\nNumerical and string constants and expressions in code can and often do imply type in a particular context. For example, an expression might imply a type of floating-point, while might imply a list of integers – typically an array.\n\nType inference is in general possible, if it is decidable in the type theory in question. Moreover, even if inference is undecidable in general for a given type theory, inference is often possible for a large subset of real-world programs. Haskell's type system, a version of Hindley–Milner, is a restriction of System Fω to so-called rank-1 polymorphic types, in which type inference is decidable. Most Haskell compilers allow arbitrary-rank polymorphism as an extension, but this makes type inference undecidable. (Type checking is decidable, however, and rank-1 programs still have type inference; higher rank polymorphic programs are rejected unless given explicit type annotations.)\n\nSome languages like Perl 6 or C# have a unified type system. This means that all C# types including primitive types inherit from a single root object. Every type in C# inherits from the Object class. Java has several primitive types that are not objects. Java provides wrapper object types that exist together with the primitive types so developers can use either the wrapper object types or the simpler non-object primitive types.\n\nA type-checker for a statically typed language must verify that the type of any expression is consistent with the type expected by the context in which that expression appears. For example, in an assignment statement of the form codice_13,\nthe inferred type of the expression \"codice_14\" must be consistent with the declared or inferred type of the variable codice_15. This notion of consistency, called \"compatibility\", is specific to each programming language.\n\nIf the type of \"codice_14\" and the type of codice_15 are the same, and assignment is allowed for that type, then this is a valid expression. Thus, in the simplest type systems, the question of whether two types are compatible reduces to that of whether they are \"equal\" (or \"equivalent\"). Different languages, however, have different criteria for when two type expressions are understood to denote the same type. These different \"equational theories\" of types vary widely, two extreme cases being \"structural type systems\", in which any two types that describe values with the same structure are equivalent, and \"nominative type systems\", in which no two syntactically distinct type expressions denote the same type (\"i.e.\", types must have the same \"name\" in order to be equal).\n\nIn languages with subtyping, the compatibility relation is more complex. In particular, if codice_18 is a subtype of codice_19, then a value of type codice_18 can be used in a context where one of type codice_19 is expected, even if the reverse is not true. Like equivalence, the subtype relation is defined differently for each programming language, with many variations possible. The presence of parametric or ad hoc polymorphism in a language may also have implications for type compatibility.\n\n\n\n"}
