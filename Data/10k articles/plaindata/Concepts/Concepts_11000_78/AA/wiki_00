{"id": "4630168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4630168", "title": "Art manifesto", "text": "Art manifesto\n\nAn art manifesto is a public declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of an artist or artistic movement. Manifestos are a standard feature of the various movements in the modernist avant-garde and are still written today. Art manifestos are sometimes in their rhetoric intended for shock value, to achieve a revolutionary effect. They often address wider issues, such as the political system. Typical themes are the need for revolution, freedom (of expression) and the implied or overtly stated superiority of the writers over the status quo. The manifesto gives a means of expressing, publicising and recording ideas for the artist or art group—even if only one or two people write the words, it is mostly still attributed to the group name.\n\nIn 1855 Gustave Courbet wrote a Realist manifesto for the introduction to the catalogue of his independent, personal exhibition. And in 1886 the Symbolist Manifesto was published in the French newspaper \"Le Figaro\" by the poet and essayist Jean Moréas.\n\nThe first art manifesto of the 20th century was introduced with the Futurists in Italy in 1909, followed by the Cubists, Vorticists, Dadaists and the Surrealists: the period up to World War II created what are still the best known manifestos. Although they never stopped being issued, other media such as the growth of broadcasting tended to sideline such declarations. Due to the internet there has been a resurgence of the form, and many new manifestos are now appearing to a potential worldwide audience. The Stuckists have made particular use of this to start a worldwide movement of affiliated groups.\n\nManifestos typically consist of a number of statements, which are numbered or in bullet points and which do not necessarily follow logically from one to the next. Tristan Tzara's explanation of the manifesto (\"Feeble Love & Bitter Love, II\") captures the spirit of many:\nBefore the early 20th century, the manifesto was almost exclusively a declaration with political aims. The intention of artists adopting the form, therefore, is to indicate that they are employing art as a political tool.\n\nThe art manifesto has two main goals. The first is to define and criticize a paradigm in contemporary art or culture; the second is to define a set of aesthetic values to counter this paradigm. Often, manifestos aspire to be works of art in their own right; for instance, many manifesto writers intend for their texts to be performed. Other manifestos cannot be fully appreciated simply as written statements because they rely heavily on graphic design for communication, a common feature in Dada manifestos. Several artists have written manifestos about artistic mediums not their own.\n\nHistorically, there has been a strong parallel between the art manifesto and the political manifesto. It was not uncommon for manifesto writers of the early 20th century to also be politically active. In Italy, Futurist founder Filippo Tomasso Marinetti ran for office, and both Russian and Italian Futurists issued political manifestos. In England, Vorticist Wyndham Lewis supported the Suffragettes, while in France, Surrealist André Breton supported the Communist party. Often however, these political organizations rejected the artists’ attention; in other cases, artists were censored and persecuted by European authoritarian governments, like Fascist Italy and Communist Russia, which institutionally rejected the avant-garde.\n\nGustave Courbet wrote a Realist manifesto for the introduction to the catalogue of his independent, personal exhibition, 1855, echoing the tone of the period's political manifestos. In it he asserts his goal as an artist \"to translate the customs, the ideas, the appearance of my epoch according to my own estimation.\"\n\nIn 1886 the Symbolist Manifesto was published in the French newspaper \"Le Figaro\" by the poet and essayist Jean Moréas. It defined and characterized Symbolism as a style whose \"goal was not the ideal, but whose sole purpose was to express itself for the sake of being expressed.\" It names Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, and Paul Verlaine as the three leading poets of the movement.\n\nThe Futurist Manifesto, written by the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, was published in the Italian newspaper \"Gazzetta dell'Emilia\" in Bologna on February 5, 1909, then in French as \"Manifeste du futurisme\" in the newspaper \"Le Figaro\" on February 20, 1909. It initiated an artistic philosophy, Futurism, that was a rejection of the past, and a celebration of speed, machinery, violence, youth and industry; it was also an advocation of the modernization and cultural rejuvenation of Italy.\n\nSince the founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme, the Futurists attempted to create one in their subsequent \"Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting\" (1914). This committed them to a \"universal dynamism\", which was to be directly represented in painting and sculpture. Objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings: \"The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places... The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it.\"\n\nDu \"Cubisme\", written in 1912 by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, was the first major theoretical text on Cubism. The book was illustrated with works by Gleizes, Metzinger, Paul Cézanne, Fernand Léger, Juan Gris, Francis Picabia, Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, André Derain and Marie Laurencin. In this highly influential treatise Gleizes and Metzinger explicitly related the concept of 'multiple perspective' to the Bergsonian sense of time. The faceted treatment of physical objects and space blurred the distinctions between subject and abstraction, between representation and non-objectivity. Effects of non-Euclidean geometry were used to convey a psychophysical sense of fluidity of consciousness. Du \"Cubisme\" introduced the concept of 'simultaneity' into the theoretical framework of Cubism. It was in part a concept born out of a conviction based on the authors understanding of Henri Poincaré and Bergson that the separation or distinction between space and time should be comprehensively challenged. It was based both on philosophical and scientific ideas, on Riemannian geometry and the relativity of knowledge, contradicting notions of absolute truth. These ideas were disseminated and debated in the widely available publication, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of modernism.\n\nPublished in \"Les Homme du jour\" in 1913, it has never been clear whether this was a sincere manifesto of the new school of amorphism, or a parody.\n\nExtracts from the Vorticists' \"BLAST\" manifesto were published in their magazine \"Blast\", number 1, on June 20, 1914, and then in \"Blast\", number 2, in July 1915.\n\nIn 1915, Kazimir Malevich laid down the foundations of Suprematism when he published his manifesto, \"From Cubism to Suprematism\".\n\nHugo Ball recited the first Dada manifesto at Cabaret Voltaire on July 14, 1916.\n\nThe second Dada manifesto was recited by Tristan Tzara at the Salle Meise on March 23, 1918, and published in Dada, No. 3 (Zurich, December 1918).\n\nSigned by Theo van Doesburg, Robt. van 't Hoff, Vilmos Huszar, Antony Kok, Piet Mondrian, Georges Vantongerloo, Jan Wils\n\nManifest I of \"The Style\" (De Stijl), from \"De Stijl\", vol. II, no. 1 (November 1918), p. 4.\n\nThe Realistic Manifesto (published August 5, 1920) was written by Russian sculptor Naum Gabo and cosigned by his brother Antoine Pevsner, and the key text of Constructivism.\n\nThe founders of Purism, Amedee Ozenfant and Charles-Edouard Jeanneret (better known as Le Corbusier), titled their manifesto \"Apres le cubism\" (After Cubism).\n\nThe first Surrealist manifesto was written by the French writer André Breton in 1924 and released to the public 1925. The document defines Surrealism as:\n\n\"Base de la peinture concrète\", was written by Otto G. Carlsund, Theo van Doesburg, Jean Hélion, Marcel Wantz and Léon Arthur Tutundjian, published in Revue Art Concret, no. 1 (April 1930).\n\nManifesto of Mural Painting was written by Mario Sironi in 1933.\n\nTowards a Free Revolutionary Art was written by surrealist André Breton and Marxist Leon Trotsky as a reaction against the Soviet Union's mandated art.\n\nWhite Manifesto is a 1946 text written by Lucio Fontana.\n\nCoBrA manifesto, titled \"La cause était entendue\", written by Christian Dotremont, and sighed by Karel Appel, Constant, Corneille, Asger Jorn, and Joseph Noiret in 1948.\n\nThe \"Refus global\" (or \"Total Refusal\") was an anti-establishment and anti-religious manifesto released on August 9, 1948 in Montreal by a group of sixteen young Québécois artists and intellectuals known as les Automatistes, led by Paul-Émile Borduas.\n\nThe \"Refus global\" was greatly influenced by French poet André Breton, and it extolled the creative force of the subconscious.\n\nManifesto of Eaismo is by Voltolino Fontani.\n\nSculptors' First Manifesto is by René Iché.\n\nMystical Manifesto was written by Salvador Dalí in 1951.\n\nThe \"Mystical Manifesto\" inaugurated Dalí's Nuclear mysticism period.\n\nWritten was by Enrico Baj.\n\nLes Spatialistes, an Italian group based in Milan drew up a manifesto for television.\n\nThis work by Michel Tapié defined the art informel movement.\n\nThis manifesto by Jirô Yoshihara defined the artistic aims of Japan's Gutai group.\n\nWritten by Gustav Metzger in 1964, this was given as a lecture to the Architectural Association, and taken over by students as an artistic \"Happening\". One of Metzger's Ealing College students was Pete Townshend, who later cited Metzger's concepts as an influence for his famous guitar-smashing during performances of The Who.\n\nNeo-Concrete Manifesto, by Ferreira Gullar, begins:\n\n\"Manifesto of Industrial Painting: For a unitary applied art\", written by Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio, in August 1959, was originally published in Italian in \"Notizie Arti Figurative\" No. 9 (1959). Shortly afterwards it was published in \"Internationale Situationniste no.3\" in a French translation. It was translated into English in 1997 by Molly Klein. It has only 70 points and is written a grand utopian rhetorical manner, with statements such as, \"A new, ravenous force of domination will push men toward an unimaginable epic poetry.\" One of its themes is the reconciliation of industry and nature:\n\nManifestos in the 1960s reflected the changing social and political attitudes of the times: the general ferment of \"counterculture\" revolution to overthrow the existing order and the particular rise of feminism and Black Power, as well as the pioneering of new art forms such as body art and performance art.\n\nThe Situationist International was founded at Cosio d’Arroscia April 27, 1957 by eight members, who wanted a revolutionary art with a state of constant transformation, and hence newness, as well as abolishing the gap between art and life. The manifesto espousing this was issued May 17, 1960 and reprinted in \"Internationale Situationniste\" number 4 in June 1960. It advocated the \"new human force\" against technology and the \"dissatisfaction of its possible uses in our senseless social life\", stating \"We will inaugurate what will historically be the last of the crafts. The role of amateur-professional situationist—of anti-specialist—is again a specialization up to the point of economic and mental abundance, when everyone becomes an 'artist'\". Its final sentence is: \"Such are our goals, and these will be the future goals of humanity.\"\n\nThis manifesto, written by Yves Klein, has been copyrighted since 1989 by the Gagosian Gallery. It begins with the prompts for the later statements in the manifesto, the first line being, \"Due to the fact that I have painted monochromes for fifteen years\". It is a meditation by the artist about his work and life:\nHe appropriates the sky:\nHe ends with an affirmation that he is \"ready to dive into the void\".\n\nClaes Oldenburg, a Pop artist, reacting against Abstract Expressionism, along with other young artists. The Manifesto ‘I am for an Art’ was originally made to be included in the catalogue of the 'Environments, Situations and Spaces’ exhibition. Each of the statements begin with 'I am for an art...'.\n\nThe following quote is from the first two statement in his poetical manifesto:\n\"I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical, that does something other than sit on its ass in a museum.I am for an art that grows up not knowing it is art at all, an art given the chance of having a starting \npoint of zero... \"\n\nWritten by George Maciunas, this short hand-printed document consists of three paragraphs interspersed with collage elements from dictionary definitions related to \"flux\". It is written in lower case, with upper case for certain key phrases, some underlined. Its first paragraph is:\nIt advocates revolution, \"living art, anti-art\" and \"non art reality to be grasped by all peoples, not only critics, dilettantes and professionals.\"\n\nSCUM, by Valerie Solanas, is an acronym for the \"Society for Cutting up Men\" and the manifesto was not specifically about art. However, it has become part of art history, because it was published in 1968, the same year that Solanas, who had spent time in Andy Warhol's \"Factory\", shot and nearly killed him. It also has sections that address art ideas. Solanas spent her last years as a street prostitute and died in 1988.\n\nIt is a document of just over 11,000 words. Its tone and basic theme are evident from the title, but it is not quite as clear cut as it seems and some women are admitted to be as bad as men (women artists, for example). SCUM wants to \"destroy all useless and harmful objects — cars, store windows, \"Great Art\", etc.\" In a section on \"'Great Art' and 'Culture'\" it states:\n\nThe full title of the manifesto is \"Maintenance Art—Proposal for an Exhibition\"; it is considered a seminal document of feminist art. Mierle Laderman Ukeles was pregnant at the time, and decided to reinterpret household chores by becoming a \"maintenance artist\", where she would \"perform\" them. Through this such \"maintenance\" revealed itself as an important condition for freedom and social functioning and she extended the idea beyond feminism to projects like the 11 month \"Touch Sanitation\", involving 8,500 New York workers. More recently she has addressed a landfill site on Staten Island.\n\nThe manifesto was followed by a questionnaire (1973–76) and was concerned with making art of what would normally be seen as routine, mundane chores. She wrote, \"After the revolution, who is going to pick up the garbage on Monday morning?\". She followed this up with a \"Sanitation Manifesto!\" (1984) The Maintenance Manifesto stated:\n\nAfri-Cobra was a black artist collective founded in the late 1960s by Jeff Donaldson and based in Chicago. He helped organise international shows of black artists and wrote influential manifestos. AfriCobra is an acronym for \"African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists\". This was derived from combining the term for Africa with \"Cobra\", the \"Coalition of Black Revolutionary Artists\". The manifesto stated the groups objectives to be the development of a new African American art, involving social responsibility, community artistic involvement and promotion of pride in Black identity. There were parallels with African American musical innovations, and the advocacy of a complementary aesthetic involving sublime imagery and high-key colours.\n\nWAR is an acronym for \"Women Artists in Revolution\" of which Nancy Spero was a member. Prior to this in 1966–70 she had created a series of anti-Vietnam War \"manifestos\" which were images created with water paints and inks on paper. She then attended AWC (Art Workers Coalition) meetings, which had men and women members, and became part of WAR, which was an offshoot. She said, \"I loved it. I was so angry at that time about so many things, especially about not being able to get my art out, to get people to look. I thought, \"WAR\"— that's it. We started to organize some actions and protests and wrote manifestos. For example, a few of us marched into the Museum of Modern Art and demanded equality for women artists. Then, I joined another, the Ad Hoc Committee of Women Artists. It all went very fast in those days.\"\n\nValie Export is a Viennese performance artist who worked with the Actionists and catalogued their events. She did her own confrontational body art, with a philosophy of \"Feminist Actionism\", inviting people to touch her in the street. She issued \"written manifestos predicting with \nvengeance the future of women's art\" and \"made important theoretical contributions to communicating a personal feminism in performance. She felt that it was important politically to create art. 'I knew that if I did it naked, I would really change how the \n(mostly male) audience would look at me.'\"\n\nThe French Sociological art Collective was founded by Fred Forest, Jean-Paul Thénot and Hervé Fischer and had their manifesto published in the newspaper Le Monde. Its main purpose was using sociology to underpin artistic actions, or using artistic actions to elucidate sociological phenomena. One such action was the auctioning of a \"artistic square meter\" in 1976 to spoof the inflation of prices in the housing and art markets. The collective made heavy use of mass media and live performance using video, telephones, etc. The group was dissolved in 1981, though some of its tenets were brought by Fred Forest and Mario Costa with the Communication aesthetics movement of 1983.\n\nIn 1975 François Pluchart promoted the first Body Art show at the Galerie Stadler in Paris, with work from 21 artists, including Marcel Duchamp, Chris Burden and Katharina Sieverding. The first Body Art manifesto was published.\n\nby Paul Hartal\n\nThis is a four-page document illustrated with nine black and white images of the artist's paintings, collages and multimedia, published in Montreal in 1975.\n\"My art is a painted metaphor; the past machine of a perpetual second, the fossil emotion of an infinite longing, the magic desire evolving on the broken axis of the compressed space, reflected in the form of inner, personal landscapes\", writes Hartal in the manifesto. \"Art ought to be total\", he suggests. \"The biotic separated from the geometrical is arbitrary, and ignores the human nature.\" The idea of \"Lyrical Conceptualism is based on the wholeness of the psychological coordinate\", he says. It \"derives from the id, ego and superego\"; an \"art in which the primarily twofold character of the artist's view evolves into a lyrical, intuitive and conceptual triad\". In The Brush and the Compass: The Interface Dynamics of Art and Science (Lanham: University Press of America, 1988, 341 pp), Hartal discusses in more detail the theory of \"Lyrical Conceptualism\" or \"Lyco art\",\n\nThe rise of the punk movement with its basic and aggressive DIY attitude had a significant input into art manifestos, and this is reflected even in the titles. Some of the artists overtly identified with punk through music, publishing or poetry performance. There is also an equivalent \"shocking\" interpretation of feminism which contradicts the non-objectification advocated in the 1960s. Then the growing presence of the computer age began to assert itself in art proclamations as in society.\n\nArtist Charles Thomson promoted the Crude Art Manifesto 1978.\n\nThis was posted in Maidstone Art College by Charles Thomson, then a student at the college. 21 years later he co-wrote the Stuckist manifestos with Billy Childish. Thomson was also a member of the punk-based The Medway Poets. The manifesto rejects \"department store\" art and \"elitist\" gallery art, as well as sophistication and skill which are \"easily obtainable ... and are used both industrially and artistically to conceal a poverty of content.\" The priority is stated to be \"the exploration and expression of the human spirit\".\n\nby Stewart Home\n\nAt this time Stewart Home operated as a one-person movement \"Generation Positive\", founding a punk band called White Colours and publishing an art fanzine \"Smile\", which mostly contained art manifestos for the \"Generation Positive\". The rhetoric of these resembled the 1920s Berlin Dadaist manifestos. His idea was that other bands round the world should also call themselves White Colours and other magazines be titled \"Smile\". The first part of the book \"Neoist Manifestos/The Art Strike Papers\" featured abriged versions of his manifesto-style writings from \"Smile\".\n\nThe basic tenet of the IAAA is the depiction of space (as in the cosmos) through realist painting. They disassociate themselves from science fiction and fantasy artists: \"a firm foundation of knowledge and research is the basis for each painting. Striving to accurately depict scenes which are at present beyond the range of human eyes\". The group now has over 120 members representing 20 countries.\n\nby the Bread and Puppet Theater\n\nThe whole title is \"the Why Cheap Art? manifesto\". It is a single sheet, issued by the Bread and Puppet Theater \"in direct response to the business of art and its growing appropriation by the corporate sector.\" There are seventeen statements, most of them beginning \"Art is\" and ending with an exclamation mark, set out mostly in upper case, sometimes mixed in with lower case, in different typefaces which get bolder through the leaflet till the final statement of a large HURRAH. It starts:\nIt stresses the positive nature of art which is beneficial to all and should be available to all, using poetic images such as \"Art is like green trees\", and urging, \"Art fights against war & stupidity! ... Art is cheap!\n\nby Donna J. Haraway\n\nThis has the full title of \"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth-Century.\" Donna Haraway is a cultural historian. She advocates the development of cyborgs (\"cybernetic organisms\") as the way forward for a post-gender society. This had a significant effect initially amongst academics. VNS Matrix, a group of Australian women artists and British cultural historian, Sadie Plant, established a cyberfeminist movement in 1994. From 1997, the Old Boys Network (OBN) has organised \"Cyberfeminist Internationals\".\n\nby Gilbert and George\n\nThe manifesto is five paragraphs, each with a subtitle, the first of which is \"Art for All\", summing up the popularist intent of their manifesto:\nThere is also an intent to change people, but \"The art-material must be subservient to the meaning and purpose of the picture.\" It states:\nThe conclusion is an affirmation of \"our life-search for new meanings and purpose to give to life.\"\n\nby Veronica Vera\n\nThe manifesto was signed by Veronica Vera and Candida Royalle (both ex porn stars who had then directed their own porn movies), Annie Sprinkle (who gives explicit sexual one woman shows) and performance artist Frank Moore, among other significant artists who use sex in their work. In 7 short points, it founds an art movement, which \"celebrates sex as the nourishing, life-giving force. We embrace our genitals as part, not separate, from our spirits.\" It advocates the \"attitude of sex-positivism\" and wishes to \"communicate our ideas and emotions ... to have fun, heal the world and endure.\"\n\nby VNS Matrix\n\nVNS Matrix was a cyberfeminist art collective founded in Adelaide, Australia, in 1991. Their manifesto, written in 1991, was translated over the years into many languages including Italian, French, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and Finnish. It begins:\nIn 1996 they wrote the Bitch Mutant Manifesto.\n\nby Michael Betancourt\n\nThe ____________ Manifesto proposed an interactive, fill-in-the-blanks view of prohibitions and claims to be made about art and art movements. It was an early interactive piece of net art that appeared in webzines and in newsgroups, inviting participation. It begins:\nThe manifesto ends with a \"Reset\" button. The text is sampled from Tristian Tzara's Dada manifestos, but key pieces from the original text have been omitted and replaced with blanks to be filled-in.\n\nIt is one of the earliest manifestos to be published on the Internet as well as in print.\n\nby Billy Childish\n\nGroup Hangman was started by Billy Childish, Tracey Emin and two others in Medway, Kent in 1983 for a short time. Fourteen years later it reformed with more members (nearly all of whom later joined the Stuckists art group), but without Emin. At this point Childish wrote 6 short manifestos, each containing 7 – 12 statements. He says, \"they were anarchic and contradictory - my favourite!\" Some of the ideas resurfaced in the Stuckist manifestos written two years later. Point 9 of \"Communication 0001\" states:\nStyle must be smashed (\"Artistic talent is the only obstacle\") and the unacceptable must be embraced. The last communication, of only two short sentences, was written in 2000 and recommends, \"It is time for art to grow up.\"\n\nby Natasha Vita-More (formerly Nancie Clark)\n\nThis was written on January 1, 1997, and was apparently \"on board the Cassini Huygens spacecraft on its mission to Saturn.\" Following the statement \"We are transhumans\", there is the explanation, \"Transhumanist Art reflects an extropic appreciation of aesthetics in a technologically enhanced world.\" After the manifesto is a \"FAQ\", which states, \"Transhumanist Arts include creative works by scientists, engineers, technicians, philosophers, athletes, educators, mathematicians, etc., who may not be artists in the traditional sense, but whose vision and creativity are integral to transhumanity.\" The Manifesto is based on a \"Transhumanist Art Statement\" written in 1982. Cited as specific influences are \"Abstract Art, Performance Art, Kinetic Art, Cubism, Techno Art, science fiction and Communications Art.\" Some collaborators of Vita-More's are named as Timothy Leary, Bill Viola and Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nWidespread access to the internet has created a new incentive for artists to publish manifestos, with the knowledge that there is an instant potential worldwide audience. The effect of the internet on art manifestos has been described: \"One could almost say we are living through a new boom time for the manifesto. The Web allows almost anybody to nail a broadsheet to the virtual wall for all to see.\" Some of the manifestos also appear in print form; others only exist as virtual text. It has also led to a great diversity of approaches, as well as a noticeable trend looking back at earlier traditions of Modernism or the Renaissance to create a present and future paradigm. The Stuckists manifesto has become well known, though most others have achieved little individual reputation or impact.\n\nby Billy Childish and Charles Thomson\n\nThe Stuckists have grown in eleven years from 13 artists in London to 209 groups in 48 countries, and claim, \"Stuckism is the first significant art movement to spread via the Internet\" The first 3 points of their numbered eponymous manifesto proclaim \"a quest for authenticity\", \"painting is the medium of self discovery\" and \"a model of art which is holistic\". The 4th point states, \"Artists who don't paint aren't artists\"; the 5th is, \"Art that has to be in a gallery to be art isn’t art.\" Points are made against conceptual art, Britart, Charles Saatchi, art gimmicks and white wall galleries, while the amateur is hailed. The final point is:\nThis manifesto is available on their web site in 7 languages. They have issued at least 8 other manifestos, including the Remodernist Manifesto (2000), which inaugurates \"a new spirituality in art\" (to replace Postmodernism's \"scientific materialism, nihilism and spiritual bankruptcy\"), the Turner Prize Manifesto, handed out in their demonstrations at Tate Britain and a Critique of Damien Hirst. The Tate gallery holds three of the manifestos. Spin-offs by other Stuckists include a Camberwell College of Arts Students for Stuckism manifesto (2000) and a teenagers' Underage Stuckists Manifesto (2006). In 2006, Allen Herndon published \"The Manifesto of the American Stuckists\", whose content was challenged by the Los Angeles Stuckists group. There has also been an anti-Stuckist manifesto published in 2005 by the London Surrealist Group.\n\nby Kerry Mitchell\n\nMitchell argued that \"Fractal Art is a subclass of two-dimensional visual art, and is in many respects similar to photography—another art form that was greeted by skepticism upon its arrival.\" Researchers at Tel Aviv claim there is a universal aesthetic to fractals, since people have consistent preferences whether fractals are created by nature, mathematics or artists.\n\nBy Mark Miremont.\n\n\"The Resurrection of Beauty\" manifesto was first published in 2010 by Galerie Provocatrice in Amsterdam for a related exhibit and film premiere. Its purpose is to inspire resistance to pretenses in conceptual art which seek to eliminate Beauty as a central concern in the future of Art. Two central lines from the manifesto are: \"Beauty is the purpose of art, just as a building is the purpose of architecture\" and \"The utility of art is to inform us of Beauty, just as the utility of science is to inform us of truth.\"\n\nby Lee Scrivner\n\nAn avant-garde manifesto that reviews avant-garde manifestos of the past hundred years, it was taped to the front door of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in April 2006. It was later published online by ICA residents, the London Consortium.\nby Denis Mandarino\n\nThe Versatilist Manifesto was written by Brazilian composer, artist and writer, Denis Mandarino, with the intention of freeing people from the expert analysis and promote the practice of art as a form of self-knowledge and spiritual enhancement, in São Paulo in July 2007. In Versatilism, there are no art contests, as no man or group is capable of judging other men. An art critic always analyses a situation from a profoundly limited point of view because his knowledge is also limited. Contests and prizes can be a way of directing public opinion and on doing so, valorizing this or that artist that aims financial or social advantages. Nevertheless, ethical cultural initiatives are praiseworthy.\n\nby Jesse Richards\n\nA manifesto on filmmaking written by former Stuckist painter, photographer and filmmaker Jesse Richards that like the closely related Remodernism manifesto, calls for a \"new spirituality\", but in this instance, in relation to cinema. The manifesto proclaims a spiritual film to be \"not about religion. It is cinema concerned with humanity and an understanding of the simple truths and moments of humanity. Spiritual film is really ALL about these moments\". Point 4 of the manifesto discusses Japanese aesthetics in relation to the idea of Remodernist film: \"The Japanese ideas of wabi-sabi (the beauty of imperfection) and mono no aware (the awareness of the transience of things and the bittersweet feelings that accompany their passing), have the ability to show the truth of existence, and should always be considered when making the remodernist film\". The manifesto also criticizes filmmakers that shoot on video, arguing that film, particularly Super-8 film \"has a rawness, and an ability to capture the poetic essence of life, that video has never been able to accomplish\" and also criticizes Stanley Kubrick's work, as being \"dishonest and boring\", as well as Dogme 95's \"pretentious checkist\" of rules. Instead, the Remodernist film philosophy seems to be somewhat anti-ego, with Richards noting that \"this manifesto should be viewed only as a collection of ideas and hints whose author may be mocked and insulted at will\". The manifesto was recently translated into Turkish and published by the film website Bakiniz, and is being translated into Polish and published by the Polish underground art and culture magazine, RED.\n\nby Conrad Bo\n\nThis manifesto was written by the South African conceptual artist Conrad Bo, who believes the Superstroke Art Movement is the first internationally known art movement in Africa since the Fook Island art movement started by Walter Battiss. The manifesto is quite specific in what the Superstroke Art Movement want to achieve. Superstroke is short for the super expressive brush stroke.\nThe Manifesto for the Superstroke Art Movement written by Conrad Bo is as follows: 1.Paintings should be executed using expressive even violent brush strokes on at least some part of the picture. 2.Should a photograph be used for a figurative painting, the objection should not be Photorealism, but Expressionism. 3.If mediums such as pen, pencil, etc. are used, the pen and pencil strokes must at least be overly expressive for it to be considered a Superstroke picture. 4.Paintings can be executed in both the abstract and figurative. 5.Subject matters such as Africa, light, dark, life and death are encouraged. 6.Collage, Stencil and Calligraphy may be used for impact. 7.The concept, Art for the sake of art, does not apply in Superstroke. In Superstroke it is art for the sake of Superstroke, as the artist must always strive for paintings rich in texture, or excessive brush or pencil strokes.\n\nby Todd Presner, Jeffrey Schnapp et al.\n\nA manifesto for the transformation of practices in the digital arts and humanities that was authored by over forty participants in the 2009 Mellon Seminar on the Digital Humanities at UCLA. The manifesto articulates a vision of the future of knowledge production in the arts and humanities disciplines.\n\nby Luke Turner\n\n\"The Metamodernist Manifesto\" was written by artist Luke Turner as \"an exercise in simultaneously defining and embodying the metamodern spirit.\" The manifesto recognised \"oscillation to be the natural order of the world\" and called for an end to \"the inertia resulting from a century of modernist ideological naivety and the cynical insincerity of its antonymous bastard child.\" Instead, Turner proposed metamodernism as \"the mercurial condition between and beyond irony and sincerity, naivety and knowingness, relativism and truth, optimism and doubt, in pursuit of a plurality of disparate and elusive horizons,\" and concluded with a call to \"go forth and oscillate!\" The manifesto formed the basis of LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner's collaborative art practice, after the actor Shia LaBeouf reached out to Turner in early 2014 after reading the text.\n\nThese manifestos are cited not for their individual significance, but as examples of the diversity of approaches that can be found in manifestos on the web, ranging through computer art, \"Gothic\" art, jokes, traditional art, punk provocation and the use of the form by commerce. This also allows the influence of historical manifestos on contemporary ideas to be assessed.\n\nManifesto by Brunette Models August 2011\n\nThe manifesto created by music artist as a negation of mainstream, commercial music, to much business, public relations in the public space etc. The manifesto is movement that promotes the freedom to distribute music as high resolution FLAC files and exchange works between artists.\n\nFractal Art Manifesto 1999\nby Kerry Mitchell\n\nThere is an introduction followed by two sections—\"Fractal art is\" (4 bullet points) and \"Fractal art is not\" (3 bullet points). Fractal art has been around \"15–20 years\". It is obviously concerned with computer-generated fractal images, but advanced as art \"in many respects similar to photography—another art form which was greeted by skepticism upon its arrival. Fractal images typically are manifested as prints, bringing Fractal Artists into the company of painters, photographers, and printmakers.\" The need for selection and skill is stressed, as is the need for the practitioner to be \"expressive\" and \"creative\". It concludes, \"Most of all, Fractal Art is simply that which is created by Fractal Artists: ART.\"\n\nNeen manifesto 2000-2006 \nby Miltos Manetas\n\nThis is a Manifesto about Website art and computer existentialism.\n\nOK Art Manifesto 2001\nby Susie Ramsay and Rafael Lozano-Hemmer\n\nThis was written tongue-in-cheek, beginning, \"'OK art' is an OK idea,—not great, but not bad either.\" It has the ring of truth when it states in point 4: \"Art enthusiasts and cynics alike, leave an OK art exhibition saying 'that was OK'. No one is blown away but they don't feel cheated either.\"\n\nMovement for Classical Renewal Manifesto 2002 by Christopher Fiddes\n\nThis British manifesto is signed by over 100 painters and sculptors of professional standing. It opens by stating \"the visual arts have reached a point of crisis. The art that has enjoyed critical acclaim in recent decades is shallow, trivial, ill-crafted and bankrupt of ideas.\" It condemns abstraction, \"the same tired formula\" of conceptualism, the Turner Prize and the destruction of art school academic training by the Coldstream Committee in the mid-20th century. It advocates technical accomplishment, reverence for the \"great art that has been in the past\" and a return to tradition while also, ironically, acknowledging:\nAn organisation with similar aims in America is the Art Renewal Center.\n\nCass Art Manifesto\n\nThis represents the adoption of a revolutionary medium by mainstream commercialism, in this case the Cass Art chain of artshops in London. As part of their promotion they have issued a \"manifesto\" in the style of an art group. It begins, \"Art is freedom. Cass Art believes in art.\" There are seven points. The sixth starts, \"Lets fill this town with artists\", which has also been displayed across their shop fronts in a banner.\n\nSymbiotic Art Manifesto 2004\n\nWritten by artist Leonel Moura and Professor Henrique Garcia Pereira this Manifesto states that \"Machines can make Art\" and the role of the artist of the 21st century is no more to produce directly art but to trigger processes that generate art. \nIn 2011 Leonel Moura launched a new version, The Istanbul Manifesto, stating that \"the great artist of tomorrow will not be human\".\n\npptArt Manifesto 2014\n\nWritten by Luca Desiata, Professor of Corporate art at LUISS Business School, the pptArt Manifesto was launched in March 2014. It states that the Corporate World can be the object of Art. It has led to the first Corporate Art exhibit at the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome on June 26, 2015\n\nOther contemporary art manifestos on the internet\n\"Date given is that of the manifesto.\"\n\n\"No date, presumed post-2000\"\n\n\n"}

After graduating she studied in the United States, attended the Stockholm School of Economics and worked in France. She finally entered an education at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs where she remained and worked as a diplomat for 44 years.\n\nDuring twenty of Karlström Dorph's years within the diplomatic corps she worked in Africa where she was stationed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Gaborone, Botswana, among other places. In 1982–88, she worked in Pretoria, South Africa.\n\nWhile stationed as second in command at the Swedish legation in Pretoria and working as a diplomat, she also had a secret mission. Her job was to get in contact with the leaders of the then prohibited anti-apartheid movement in South Africa and Namibia, and find ways to transfer money from Sweden to support their cause. The operation was initiated by Olof Palme and the Swedish government. These arrangements were clandestine and were not discussed in public in the Riksdag. A total sum of about SEK 1.6 billion ($200 million) were transferred to the African National Congress and other organizations. Karlström Dorph established a contact net of recipients and ways to transfer the money. Information about the transfers were sent as encrypted telegrams, by couriers or as hidden messages in gifts. The money came mainly from the humanitarian government agency Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) but could not be channeled directly since officially, Sweden was not giving any aid to South Africa.\n\nA significant part of the money was used for legal help in defending black persons accused of breaking any of the apartheid laws that were in effect at the time. This help led to a number of people escaping the death penalty, or had their jail sentences drastically reduced. Money also went to churches, newspapers, unions and women's organizations and the United Democratic Front.\n\nKarlström Dorph has been celebrated as a hero among the South African anti-apartheid activists and she was invited to a birthday party for Nelson Mandela as well as the ANC's centennial celebration.\n\nIn 2015, the Sveriges Television made a documentary about Karlström Dorph called \"Palmes hemliga agent\" (\"Palme's secret agent\").\n\nKarlström Dorph has five children and her husband is deceased.

It involves the direct evaluation of clinical neurological populations by employing experimental methods originally developed for use with nonhuman animals.\n\nOver many decades of animal research, methods were perfected to study the effects of well-defined brain lesions on specific behaviors, and later the tasks were modified for human use. Generally the modifications involve changing the reward from food to money, but standard administration of the tasks in humans still involves minimal instructions, thus necessitating a degree of procedural learning in human and nonhuman animals alike.\n\nCurrently, comparative neuropsychology is used with neurological patients to link specific deficits with localized areas of the brain.\n\nThe comparative neuropsychological approach employs simple tasks that can be mastered without relying upon language skills. Precisely because these simple paradigms do not require linguistic strategies for solution, they are especially useful for working with patients whose language skills are compromised, or whose cognitive skills may be minimal.\n\nComparative neuropsychology contrasts with the traditional approach of using tasks that rely upon linguistic skills, and that were designed to study human cognition. Because important ambiguities about its heuristic value had not been addressed empirically, only recently has comparative neuropsychology become popular for implementation with brain-damaged patients.\n\nWithin the past decade, comparative neuropsychology has had prevalent use as a framework for comparing and contrasting the performances of disparate neurobehavioral populations on similar tasks.\n\nComparative neuropsychology involves the study of brain-behavior relationships by applying experimental paradigms, used extensively in animal laboratories, for testing human clinical populations. Popular paradigms include delayed reaction tasks, discrimination and reversal learning tasks, and matching- and nonmatching-to-sample. These tasks are used to test animals and relate them to human brain functioning. Such tasks were perfected on experimental animals having well defined brain lesions, and adapted for human neurological patients. The comparative aspects of such approach resides in the analogy between animals with brain lesions and human patients with lesions in homologous areas of the brain. One example is represented by the comparison between the brain of laboratory animals (primarily non human primates and mice) with the one of people with damages resulting from alcohol abuse.\n\nGeorge Ettlinger was one of the few who actively combined human and animal research, and he did so consistently throughout his scientific career. Ettinger work focused on the importance of the inferior temporal neocortex in visual discrimination learning and memory in macaque monkeys, and on the importance of ventral temporal lobe in vision. Ettinger animals models carried inferotemporal or latero-ventral prestriate ablation. In 1966 George Ettlinger, together with the psychologist Colin Blakemore and the neurosurgeon Murray Falconer, described the results of a study on correlation between pre-operative intelligence and the severity of mesial temporal sclerosis in temporal lobe specimens excised to treat intractable epilepsy. Such study It is known as a forerunner of what has become one of the potentially most interesting techniques for exploring the relationship between certain aspects of human memory and temporal lobe structures.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "491578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=491578", "title": "Counterfactual conditional", "text": "Counterfactual conditional\n\nA counterfactual conditional (abbreviated ), is a conditional containing an if-clause which is contrary to fact. The term \"counterfactual conditional\" was coined by Nelson Goodman in 1947, extending Roderick Chisholm's (1946) notion of a \"contrary-to-fact conditional\". The study of counterfactual speculation has increasingly engaged the interest of scholars in a wide range of domains such as philosophy, human geography, psychology, cognitive psychology, history, political science, economics, social psychology, law, organizational theory, marketing, and epidemiology.\n\nIn 1748, when defining causation, David Hume referred to a counterfactual case:\nCounterfactualism is the view that dispositions are a type of counterfactual property.\n\nThe difference between indicative and counterfactual conditionals, in a context of past time reference, is one of emphasis. This can be illustrated with a pair of examples in which the \"if\" clause is in the past indicative in the first example but in the pluperfect subjunctive in the second:\n\nThe protasis (the \"if\" clause) of the first sentence may or may not be true according to the speaker, so the apodosis (the \"then\" clause) also may or may not be true; the apodosis is asserted by the speaker to be true if the protasis is true. In this sentence the \"if\" clause and the \"then\" clause are both in the past tense of the indicative mood.\n\nIn the second sentence, the speaker is speaking with a certainty that Oswald \"did\" shoot Kennedy. According to the speaker, the \"if\" clause is false, so the \"then\" clause deals with the counterfactual result, i.e., what would have happened. In this sentence the \"if\" clause is in the pluperfect subjunctive form of the subjunctive mood, and the \"then\" clause is in the conditional perfect form of the conditional mood.\n\nA corresponding pair of examples with present time reference uses the present indicative in the \"if\" clause of the first sentence but the past subjunctive in the second sentence's \"if\" clause:\n\nHere again, in the first sentence the \"if\" clause may or may not be true; the \"then\" clause may or may not be true but certainly (according to the speaker) is true conditional on the \"if\" clause being true. Here both the \"if\" clause and the \"then\" clause are in the present indicative. In the second sentence, the \"if\" clause is not true, while the \"then\" clause may or may not be true but certainly would be true in the counterfactual circumstance of the \"if\" clause being true. In this sentence, the \"if\" clause is in the past subjunctive form of the subjunctive mood, and the \"then\" clause is in the conditional mood.\n\nThe use of the terms \"antecedent\" and \"subsequent\" is ambiguous. In logic, while \"antecedent\" usually means the if-clause, it might refer to whichever comes first. Protasis and apodosis avoid the issue entirely.\n\nPeople engage in counterfactual thinking frequently. Experimental evidence indicates that people's thoughts about counterfactual conditionals differ in important ways from their thoughts about indicative conditionals.\n\nParticipants in experiments were asked to read sentences, including counterfactual conditionals, e.g., 'if Mark had left home early he would have caught the train'. Afterwards, they were asked to identify which sentences they had been shown. They often mistakenly believed they had been shown sentences corresponding to the presupposed facts, e.g., 'Mark did not leave home early' and 'Mark did not catch the train' (Fillenbaum, 1974). In other experiments, participants were asked to read short stories that contained counterfactual conditionals, e.g., 'if there had been roses in the flower shop then there would have been lilies'. Later in the story they read sentences corresponding to the presupposed facts, e.g., 'there were no roses and there were no lilies'. The counterfactual conditional 'primed' them to read the sentence corresponding to the presupposed facts very rapidly; no such priming effect occurred for indicative conditionals (Santamaria, Espino, and Byrne, 2005). They spend different amounts of time 'updating' a story that contains a counterfactual conditional compared to one that contains factual information (De Vega, Urrutia, and Riffo, 2007) and they focus on different parts of counterfactual conditionals (Ferguson and Sanford, 2008).\n\nExperiments have compared the inferences people make from counterfactual conditionals and indicative conditionals. Given a counterfactual conditional, e.g., 'If there had been a circle on the blackboard then there would have been a triangle', and the subsequent information 'in fact there was no triangle', participants make the modus tollens inference 'there was no circle' more often than they do from an indicative conditional (Byrne and Tasso, 1999). Given the counterfactual conditional and the subsequent information 'in fact there was a circle', participants make the modus ponens inference as often as they do from an indicative conditional. See counterfactual thinking.\n\nRuth M.J. Byrne proposed in \"The Rational Imagination: How People Create Alternatives to Reality\" that people construct mental representations that encompass two possibilities when they understand, and reason from, a counterfactual conditional, e.g., 'if Oswald had not shot Kennedy, then someone else would have'. They envisage the conjecture 'Oswald did not shoot Kennedy and someone else did' and they also think about the presupposed facts 'Oswald did shoot Kennedy and someone else did not' (Byrne, 2005). According to the mental model theory of reasoning, they construct mental models of the alternative possibilities, as described in \"Deduction\" (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).\n\nIn order to distinguish counterfactual conditionals from material conditionals, a new logical connective '>' is defined, where \"A\" > \"B\" can be interpreted as \"If it were the case that \"A\", then it would be the case that \"B\".\"\n\nThe truth value of a material conditional, \"A\" → \"B\", is determined by the truth values of \"A\" and \"B\". This is not so for the counterfactual conditional \"A\" > \"B\", for there are different situations agreeing on the truth values of A and B but which yield different evaluations of \"A\" > \"B\". For example, if Keith is in Germany, the following two conditionals have both a false antecedent and a false consequent:\n\n\nIndeed, if Keith is in Germany, then all three conditions \"Keith is in Mexico\", \"Keith is in Africa\", and \"Keith is in North America\" are false. However, (1) is obviously false, while (2) is true as Mexico is part of North America.\n\nPhilosophers such as David Lewis and Robert Stalnaker modeled counterfactuals using the possible world semantics of modal logic. The semantics of a conditional \"A\" > \"B\" are given by some function on the relative closeness of worlds where A is true and B is true, on the one hand, and worlds where A is true but B is not, on the other.\n\nOn Lewis's account, A > C is (a) vacuously true if and only if there are no worlds where A is true (for example, if A is logically or metaphysically impossible); (b) non-vacuously true if and only if, among the worlds where A is true, some worlds where C is true are closer to the actual world than any world where C is not true; or (c) false otherwise. Although in Lewis's \"Counterfactuals\" it was unclear what he meant by 'closeness', in later writings, Lewis made it clear that he did \"not\" intend the metric of 'closeness' to be simply our ordinary notion of overall similarity.\n\nExample:\nOn Lewis's account, the truth of this statement consists in the fact that, among possible worlds where he ate more for breakfast, there is at least one world where he is not hungry at 11 am and which is closer to our world than any world where he ate more for breakfast but is still hungry at 11 am.\n\nStalnaker's account differs from Lewis's most notably in his acceptance of the \"limit\" and \"uniqueness assumptions\". The uniqueness assumption is the thesis that, for any antecedent A, there is a unique possible world where A is true, while the limit assumption is the thesis that, for a given antecedent A, there is a unique set of worlds where A is true that are closest. (The uniqueness assumption entails the limit assumption, but the limit assumption does not entail the uniqueness assumption.) On Stalnaker's account, A > C is non-vacuously true if and only if, at the closest world where A is true, C is true. So, the above example is true just in case at the single, closest world where he ate more breakfast, he does not feel hungry at 11 am. Although it is controversial, Lewis rejected the limit assumption (and therefore the uniqueness assumption) because it rules out the possibility that there might be worlds that get closer and closer to the actual world without limit. For example, there might be an infinite series of worlds, each with a coffee cup a smaller fraction of an inch to the left of its actual position, but none of which is uniquely the closest. (See Lewis 1973: 20.)\n\nOne consequence of Stalnaker's acceptance of the uniqueness assumption is that, if the law of excluded middle is true, then all instances of the formula (A > C) ∨ (A > ¬C) are true. The law of excluded middle is the thesis that for all propositions p, p ∨ ¬p is true. If the uniqueness assumption is true, then for every antecedent A, there is a uniquely closest world where A is true. If the law of excluded middle is true, any consequent C is either true or false at that world where A is true. So for every counterfactual A > C, either A > C or A > ¬C is true. This is called conditional excluded middle (CEM). Example:\n\nOn Stalnaker's analysis, there is a closest world where the fair coin mentioned in (1) and (2) is flipped and at that world either it lands heads or it lands tails. So either (1) is true and (2) is false or (1) is false and (2) true. On Lewis's analysis, however, both (1) and (2) are false, for the worlds where the fair coin lands heads are no more or less close than the worlds where they land tails. For Lewis, \"If the coin had been flipped, it would have landed heads or tails\" is true, but this does not entail that \"If the coin had been flipped, it would have landed heads, or: If the coin had been flipped it would have landed tails.\"\n\nCounterfactual conditionals may also be evaluated using the so-called Ramsey test: \"A\" > \"B\" holds if and only if the addition of \"A\" to the current body of knowledge has \"B\" as a consequence. This condition relates counterfactual conditionals to belief revision, as the evaluation of \"A\" > \"B\" can be done by first revising the current knowledge with \"A\" and then checking whether \"B\" is true in what results. Revising is easy when \"A\" is consistent with the current beliefs, but can be hard otherwise. Every semantics for belief revision can be used for evaluating conditional statements. Conversely, every method for evaluating conditionals can be seen as a way for performing revision.\n\nGinsberg (1986) has proposed a semantics for conditionals which assumes that the current beliefs form a set of propositional formulae, considering the maximal sets of these formulae that are consistent with \"A\", and adding \"A\" to each. The rationale is that each of these maximal sets represents a possible state of belief in which \"A\" is true that is as similar as possible to the original one. The conditional statement \"A\" > \"B\" therefore holds if and only if \"B\" is true in all such sets. \n\nThe counterfactual conditional is the basis of experimental methods for establishing causality in the natural and social sciences, e.g., whether taking antibiotics helps cure bacterial infection. For every individual, \"u\", there is a function that specifies the state of \"u\"'s infection under two hypothetical conditions: had \"u\" taken antibiotic and had \"u\" not taken antibiotic. Only one of these states can be observed in any instance, since they are mutually exclusive. The overall effect of antibiotic on infection is defined as the difference between these two states, averaged over the entire population. If the treatment and control groups are selected at random, the effect of antibiotic can be estimated by comparing the rates of recovery in the two groups.\n\nThe tight connection between causal and counterfactual relations has prompted Judea Pearl (2000) to reject both the possible world semantics and those of Ramsey and Ginsberg. The latter was rejected because causal information cannot be encoded as a set of beliefs, and the former because it is difficult to fine-tune Lewis's similarity measure to match causal intuition. Pearl defines counterfactuals directly in terms of a \"structural equation model\" – a set of equations, in which each variable is assigned a value that is an explicit function of other variables in the system. Given such a model, the sentence \"\"Y\" would be \"y\" had \"X\" been \"x\"\" (formally, \"X = x\" > \"Y = y\" ) is defined as the assertion: If we replace the equation currently determining \"X\" with a constant \"X = x\", and solve the set of equations for variable \"Y\", the solution obtained will be \"Y = y\". This definition has been shown to be compatible with the axioms of possible world semantics and forms the basis for causal inference in the natural and social sciences, since each structural equation in those domains corresponds to a familiar causal mechanism that can be meaningfully reasoned about by investigators.

The first prosecution for crimes against humanity took place at the Nuremberg trials. Crimes against humanity have since been prosecuted by other international courts (for example, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Court) as well as in domestic prosecutions. The law of crimes against humanity has primarily developed through the evolution of customary international law. Crimes against humanity are not codified in an international convention, although there is currently an international effort to establish such a treaty, led by the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative.\n\nUnlike war crimes, crimes against humanity can be committed during peace or war. They are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority. War crimes, murder, massacres, dehumanization, genocide, ethnic cleansing, deportations, unethical human experimentation, extrajudicial punishments including summary executions, use of WMDs, state terrorism or state sponsoring of terrorism, death squads, kidnappings and forced disappearances, military use of children, unjust imprisonment, enslavement, cannibalism, torture, rape, political repression, racial discrimination, religious persecution, and other human rights abuses may reach the threshold of crimes against humanity if they are part of a widespread or systematic practice.\n\nThe term \"crimes against humanity\" is potentially ambiguous because of the ambiguity of the word \"humanity\", which can mean humankind (all human beings collectively) or the value of humanness. The history of the term shows that the latter sense is intended.\n\nThere were several bilateral treaties in 1814 that foreshadowed the multilateral treaty of Final Act of the Congress of Vienna (1815) that used wording expressing condemnation of the slave trade using moral language. For example, the Treaty of Paris (1814) between Britain and France included the wording \"principles of natural justice\"; and the British and United States plenipotentiaries stated in the Treaty of Ghent (1814) that the slave trade violated the \"principles of humanity and justice\".\n\nThe multilateral \"Declaration of the Powers, on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, of 8 February 1815\" (Which also formed of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna of the same year) included in its first sentence the concept of the \"principles of humanity and universal morality\" as justification for ending a trade that was \"odious in its continuance\".\n\nThe term \"crimes against humanity\" was used by George Washington Williams in a pamphlet published in 1890 to describe the practices of Leopold II of Belgium's administration of the Congo Free State. In treaty law, the term originated in the Second Hague Convention of 1899 preamble and was expanded in the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907 preamble and their respective regulations, which were concerned with the codification of new rules of international humanitarian law. The preamble of the two Conventions referenced the “laws of humanity” as an expression of underlying inarticulated humanistic values. The term is part of what is known as the Martens Clause.\n\nOn May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers, Britain, France, and Russia, jointly issued a statement explicitly charging for the first time ever another government of committing \"a crime against humanity\". An excerpt from this joint statement reads:\n\nAt the conclusion of the war, an international war crimes commission recommended the creation of a tribunal to try \"violations of the laws of humanity\". However, the US representative objected to references to \"law of humanity\" as being imprecise and insufficiently developed at that time and the concept was not pursued.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal set down the laws and procedures by which the Nuremberg trials were to be conducted. The drafters of this document were faced with the problem of how to respond to the Holocaust and grave crimes committed by the Nazi regime. A traditional understanding of war crimes gave no provision for crimes committed by a power on its own citizens. Therefore, Article 6 of the Charter was drafted to include not only traditional war crimes and crimes against peace, but also \"crimes against humanity\", defined as\nUnder this definition, crimes against humanity could only be punished insofar as they could be connected somehow to war crimes or crimes against peace. The jurisdictional limitation was explained by the American chief representative to the London Conference, Robert H. Jackson, who pointed out that it \"has been a general principle from time immemorial that the internal affairs of another government are not ordinarily our business\". Thus, \"it is justifiable that we interfere or attempt to bring retribution to individuals or to states only because the concentration camps and the deportations were in pursuance of a common plan or enterprise of making an unjust war\". The judgement of the first Nuremberg trial found that \"the policy of persecution, repression and murder of civilians\" and persecution of Jews within Germany before the outbreak of war in 1939 were not crimes against humanity, because as \"revolting and horrible as many of these crimes were, it has not been satisfactorily proved that they were done in execution of, or in connection with,\" war crimes or crimes against peace. The subsequent Nuremberg trials were conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 which included a revised definition of crimes against humanity with a wider scope.\n\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), also known as the Tokyo Trial, was convened to try the leaders of the Empire of Japan for three types of crimes: \"Class A\" (crimes against peace), \"Class B\" (war crimes), and \"Class C\" (crimes against humanity), committed during the Second World War.\n\nThe legal basis for the trial was established by the Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (CIMTFE) that was proclaimed on 19 January 1946. The tribunal convened on May 3, 1946, and was adjourned on November 12, 1948.\n\nIn the Tokyo Trial, Crimes against Humanity (Class C) was not applied for any suspect. Prosecutions related to the Nanking Massacre were categorised as infringements upon the Laws of War.\n\nA panel of eleven judges presided over the IMTFE, one each from victorious Allied powers (United States, Republic of China, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Provisional Government of the French Republic, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, British India, and the Philippines).\n\nThe different types of crimes which may constitute crimes against humanity differs between definitions both internationally and on the domestic level. Isolated inhumane acts of a certain nature committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack may instead constitute grave infringements of human rights, or – depending on the circumstances – war crimes, but are not classified as crimes against humanity.\n\nThe systematic persecution of one racial group by another, such as occurred during the South African apartheid government, was recognized as a crime against humanity by the United Nations General Assembly in 1976. The Charter of the United Nations (Article 13, 14, 15) makes actions of the General Assembly advisory to the Security Council. In regard to apartheid in particular, the UN General Assembly has not made any findings, nor have apartheid-related trials for crimes against humanity been conducted.\n\nNeither the Nuremberg or Tokyo Charters contained an explicit provision recognizing sexual and gender-based crimes as war crimes or crimes against humanity, although Control Council Law No. 10 recognized rape as a crime against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda both included rape as a crime against humanity. The ICC is the first international instrument expressly to include various forms of sexual and gender-based crimes including rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilisation, and other forms of sexual violence as both an underlying act of crimes against humanity and war crime committed in international and/or non-international armed conflicts. As an example, the events of Khojaly and Khatyn can be shown that the world strongly condemns. International institutions have asked for a ransom to avoid such incidents. There are hundreds of massacres, thousands of prisoners and wounded in these incidents.\n\nIn 2008, the U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 1820, which noted that \"rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide\".\n\nUnlike genocide and war crimes, which have been widely recognized and prohibited in international criminal law since the establishment of the Nuremberg principles, there has never been a comprehensive convention on crimes against humanity, even though such crimes are continuously perpetrated worldwide in numerous conflicts and crises. There are eleven international texts defining crimes against humanity, but they all differ slightly as to their definition of that crime and its legal elements.\n\nIn 2008, the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative was launched by Professor Leila Nadya Sadat at the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute to address this gap in international law. The Initiative represents the first concerted effort to address the gap that exists in international criminal law by enumerating a comprehensive international convention on crimes against humanity.\n\nOn July 30, 2013, the United Nations International Law Commission voted to include the topic of crimes against humanity in its long-term program of work. In July 2014, the Commission moved this topic to its active programme of work based largely on a report submitted by Sean D. Murphy. Professor Sean D. Murphy, the United States’ Member on the United Nations’ International Law Commission, has been named the Special Rapporteur for Crimes Against Humanity. Sean D. Murphy attended the 2008 Experts' Meeting held by the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative prior to this appointment.\n\nThere is some debate on what the status of crimes against humanity under customary international law is. M. Cherif Bassiouni argues that crimes against humanity are part of \"jus cogens\" and as such constitute a non-derogable rule of international law.\n\nThe United Nations has been primarily responsible for the prosecution of crimes against humanity since it was chartered in 1948.\n\nAfter Nuremberg, there was no international court with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity for almost 50 years. Work continued on developing the definition of crimes against humanity at the United Nations, however. In 1947, the International Law Commission was charged by the United Nations General Assembly with the formulation of the principles of international law recognized and reinforced in the Nuremberg Charter and judgment, and with drafting a ‘code of offenses against the peace and security of mankind’. Completed fifty years later in 1996, the Draft Code defined crimes against humanity as various inhumane acts, i.e., \"murder, extermination, torture, enslavement, persecution on political, racial, religious or ethnic grounds, institutionalized discrimination, arbitrary deportation or forcible transfer of population, arbitrary imprisonment, rape, enforced prostitution and other inhuman acts committed in a systematic manner or on a large scale and instigated or directed by a Government or by any organization or group.\" This definition differs from the one used in Nuremberg, where the criminal acts were to have been committed “before or during the war”, thus establishing a nexus between crimes against humanity and armed conflict.\n\nA report on the 2008–09 Gaza War by Richard Goldstone accused Palestinian and Israeli forces of possibly committing a crime against humanity. In 2011, Goldstone said that he no longer believed that Israeli forces had targeted civilians or committed a crime against humanity.\n\nOn 21 March 2013, at its 22nd session, the United Nations Human Rights Council established the Commission of Inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). The Commission is mandated to investigate the systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with a view to ensuring full accountability, in particular for violations which may amount to crimes against humanity. The Commission dealt with matters relating to crimes against humanity on the basis of definitions set out by customary international criminal law and in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The 2014 Report by the commission found \"the body of testimony and other information it received establishes that crimes against humanity have been committed in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the State... These crimes against humanity entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation. The commission further finds that crimes against humanity are ongoing in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea because the policies, institutions and patterns of impunity that lie at their heart remain in place.\" Additionally, the commission found that crimes against humanity have been committed against starving populations, particularly during the 1990s, and are being committed against persons from other countries who were systematically abducted or denied repatriation, in order to gain labour and other skills for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\nUN Security Council Resolution 1674, adopted by the United Nations Security Council on 28 April 2006, \"reaffirms the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\". The resolution commits the Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.\n\nIn 2008 the U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 1820, which noted that “rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide”.\n\nAfter the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials of 1945-1946, the next international tribunal with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity was not established for another five decades. In response to atrocities committed in the 1990s, multiple ad hoc tribunals were established with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugolavia and for Rwanda each contain different definitions of crimes against humanity.\n\nIn 1993, the UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), with jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute three international crimes which had taken place in the former Yugoslavia: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Article 5 of the ICTY Statute states that \n\nThis definition of crimes against humanity revived the original ‘Nuremberg’ nexus with armed conflict, connecting crimes against humanity to both international and non-international armed conflict. It also expanded the list of criminal acts used in Nuremberg to include imprisonment, torture and rape. Cherif Bassiouni has argued that this definition was necessary as the conflict in the former Yugoslavia was considered to be a conflict of both an international and non-international nature. Therefore, this adjusted definition of crimes against humanity was necessary to afford the tribunal jurisdiction over this crime.\n\nThe UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994 following the Rwandan Genocide. Under the ICTR Statute, the link between crimes against humanity and an armed conflict of any kind was dropped. Rather, the requirement was added that the inhumane acts must be part of a “systematic or widespread attack against any civilian population on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds.” Unlike the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the conflict in Rwanda was deemed to be non-international, so crimes against humanity would likely not have been applicable if the nexus to armed conflict had been maintained.\n\nIn 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) was established in The Hague (Netherlands) and the Rome Statute provides for the ICC to have jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The definition of what is a \"crime against humanity\" for ICC proceedings has significantly broadened from its original legal definition or that used by the UN. Essentially, the Rome Statute employs the same definition of crimes against humanity that the ICTR Statute does, minus the requirement that the attack was carried out ‘on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds’. In addition, the Rome Statute definition offers the most expansive list of specific criminal acts that may constitute crimes against humanity to date.\n\nArticle 7 of the treaty stated that:\n\nThe Rome Statute Explanatory Memorandum states that crimes against humanity\nTo fall under the Rome Statute, a crime against humanity which is defined in Article 7.1 must be \"part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population\". Article 7.2.a states \"For the purpose of paragraph 1: \"Attack directed against any civilian population means a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack.\" This means that an individual crime on its own, or even a number of such crimes, would not fall under the Rome Statute unless they were the result of a State policy or an organizational policy. This was confirmed by Luis Moreno Ocampo in an open letter publishing his conclusions about allegations of crimes committed during the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 which might fall under the ICC. In a section entitled \"Allegations concerning Genocide and Crimes against Humanity\" he states that \"the available information provided no reasonable indicator of the required elements for a crime against humanity,\" i.e. 'a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population'\".\n\nThe ICC can only prosecute crimes against humanity in situations under which it has jurisdiction. The ICC only has jurisdiction over crimes contained in its statute - genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity - which have been committed on the territory of a State party to the Rome Statute, when a non-party State refers a situation within its country to the court or when the United Nation Security Council refers a case to the ICC. In 2005 the UN referred to the ICC the situation in Darfur. This referral resulted in an indictment of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in 2008. When the ICC President reported to the UN regarding its progress handling these crimes against humanity case, Judge Phillipe Kirsch said \"The Court does not have the power to arrest these persons. That is the responsibility of States and other actors. Without arrests, there can be no trials.\n\nThe Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 30 April 2002 issued a recommendation to the member states, on the protection of women against violence. In the section \"Additional measures concerning violence in conflict and post-conflict situations\", states in paragraph 69 that member states should: \"penalize rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity as an intolerable violation of human rights, as crimes against humanity and, when committed in the context of an armed conflict, as war crimes;\"\n\nIn the Explanatory Memorandum on this recommendation when considering paragraph 69:\nThe Holodomor has been recognized as a crime against humanity by the European Parliament.\n\nSources say the 20th century can be considered the bloodiest period in global history. Millions of civilian infants, youngsters, adults, and elderly people died in warfare. One civilian perished for every combatant killed. Efforts of the International Committee of the Red Cross, humanitarian laws, and rules of warfare were not able to stop these crimes against humanity. These terminologies were invented since previous vocabulary was not enough to describe these offenses. War criminals did not fear prosecution, apprehension, or imprisonment before World War II. Britain’s Prime Minister Winston Churchill favored the outright execution of war criminals. The United States was more lenient and called for a just trial. The British Government was convinced to institute the Nuremberg Trial which left several legacies. These are worldwide jurisdiction for severe war crimes are, creation of international war crime tribunals, judicial procedures that documented history of colossal crimes effectively, and success of UN courts in holding impartial trials.\n\nThe UN pointed out the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) specifically Article 7 (Crimes against Humanity which defines large-scale acts of violence against a locality’s civilian populace. These acts consist of murder; annihilation; enslavement; bondage; forced removal of the population; imprisonment or deprivation of physical liberty that violates international laws; maltreatment; forced prostitution and rape; discrimination and tyranny against certain groups; apartheid (racial discrimination and segregation); and, other inhumane acts. A publication from Trial International mentioned that crimes against humanity have been collated starting in 1990. These were the 1993 Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (now called the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 1994 Statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, and 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal. The latter contains the latest and most extensive list of detailed crimes against civilians.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "801653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=801653", "title": "Criticism of the War on Terror", "text": "Criticism of the War on Terror\n\nCriticism of the War on Terror addresses the morals, ethics, efficiency, economics, as well as other issues surrounding the War on Terror. It also touches upon criticism against the phrase itself, which was branded as a misnomer. The notion of a \"war\" against \"terrorism\" has proven highly contentious, with critics charging that participating governments exploited it to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives, reduce civil liberties, and infringe upon human rights. It is argued that the term war is not appropriate in this context (as in War on Drugs), since there is no identifiable enemy and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.\n\nOther critics, such as Francis Fukuyama, note that \"terrorism\" is not an enemy, but a tactic: calling it a \"war on terror\" obscures differences between conflicts such as anti-occupation insurgents and international mujahideen. With a military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan and its associated collateral damage Shirley Williams maintains this increases resentment and terrorist threats against the West. Other criticism include United States hypocrisy, media induced hysteria, and that changes in American foreign and security policy have shifted world opinion against the US.\n\nVarious critics dubbed the term \"War on Terror\" as nonsensical.\nFor example, billionaire activist investor George Soros criticized the term \"War on Terror\" as a \"false metaphor.\" \nLinguist George Lakoff of the Rockridge Institute argued that there cannot literally be a on terror, since is an abstract noun. \"Terror cannot be destroyed by weapons or signing a peace treaty. A war on terror has no end.\"\n\nJason Burke, a journalist who writes about radical Islamic activity, describes the terms \"terrorism\" and \"war against terrorism\" in this manner:\n\nThere are multiple ways of defining terrorism and all are subjective. Most define terrorism as 'the use or threat of serious violence' to advance some kind of 'cause'. Some state clearly the kinds of group ('sub-national', 'non-state') or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on the instinct of most people when confronted with an act that involves innocent civilians being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. None is satisfactory and grave problems with the use of the term persist.\n\nTerrorism is after all, a tactic. The term 'war on terrorism' is thus effectively nonsensical. As there is no space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term 'militancy'. This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyze them in a clearer way.\n\nFormer U.S. President George W. Bush articulated the goals of the War on Terror in a September 20, 2001 speech, in which he said that it \"will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.\" In that same speech, he called the war \"a task that does not end\", an argument he reiterated in 2006 State of The Union address.\n\nOne justification given for the invasion of Iraq was to prevent terroristic, or other attacks, by Iraq on the United States or other nations. This can be viewed as a conventional warfare realization of the War on Terror.\n\nA major criticism leveled at this justification is that it does not fulfill one of the requirements of a just war and that in waging war preemptively, the United States undermined international law and the authority of the United Nations, particularly the United Nations Security Council. On this ground, by invading a country that did not pose an imminent threat without UN support, the U.S. violated international law, including the UN Charter and the Nuremberg principles, therefore committing a war of aggression, which is considered a war crime. Additional criticism raised the point that the United States might have set a precedent, under the premise of which any nation could justify the invasion of other states.\n\nRichard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that on the eve of U.S. intervention in 2003, Iraq represented, at best, a gathering threat and not an imminent one. In hindsight he notes that Iraq did not even represent a gathering threat. \"The decision to attack Iraq in March 2003 was discretionary: it was a war of choice. There was no vital American interests in imminent danger and there were alternatives to using military force, such as strengthening existing sanctions.\" However, Haass argues that U.S. intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 began as a war of necessity—vital interests were at stake—but morphed \"into something else and it crossed a line in March 2009, when President Barack Obama` decided to sharply increase American troop levels and declared that it was U.S. policy to 'take the fight to the Taliban in the south and east' of the country.\" Afghanistan, according to Haass, eventually became a war of choice.\n\nExcerpts from an April 2006 report compiled from sixteen U.S. government intelligence agencies has strengthened the claim that engaging in Iraq has increased terrorism in the region.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, critics have claimed that the Blair government used the War on Terror as a pretext to radically curtail civil liberties, some enshrined in law since Magna Carta. For example, the detention-without-trial in Belmarsh prison: controls on free speech through laws against protests near Parliament and laws banning the \"glorification\" of terrorism: and reductions in checks on police power, as in the case of Jean Charles de Menezes and Mohammed Abdul Kahar.\n\nFormer Liberal Democrat Leader Sir Menzies Campbell has also condemned Blair's inaction over the controversial U.S. practice of extraordinary rendition, arguing that the human rights conventions to which the UK is a signatory (e.g. European Convention on Human Rights) impose on the government a \"legal obligation\" to investigate and prevent potential torture and human rights violations.\n\nU.S. President George W. Bush's remark of November 2001 claiming that \"You're either with us or you are with the terrorists,\" has been a source of criticism. Thomas A. Keaney of Johns Hopkins University's Foreign Policy Institute said \"it made diplomacy with a number of different countries far more difficult because obviously there are different problems throughout the world.\"\n\nSince the War on Terror revolved primarily around the United States and other NATO states intervening in the internal affairs of Muslim countries (i.e. in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.) and organisations, it has been labelled a war against Islam by ex-United States Attorney General Ramsey Clark, among others. \nAfter his release from Guantanamo in 2005, ex-detainee Moazzam Begg appeared in the Islamist propaganda video \"21st Century CrUSAders\" and claimed the U.S. was engaging in a new crusade:\n\nI think that history is definitely repeating itself and for the Muslim world and I think even a great part of the non-Muslim world now, are beginning to recognize that there are ambitions that the United States has on the lands and wealth of nations of Islam.\n\nUniversity of Chicago professor and political scientist, Robert Pape has written extensive work on suicide terrorism and states that it is triggered by military occupations, not extremist ideologies. In works such as \"\" and \"Cutting the Fuse\", he uses data from an extensive terrorism database and argues that by increasing military occupations, the US government is increasing terrorism. Pape is also the director and founder of the Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism (CPOST), a database of every known suicide terrorist attack from 1980 to 2008.\n\nIn 2006, a National Intelligence Estimate stated that the war in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism. The estimate was compiled by 16 intelligence agencies and was the first assessment of global terrorism since the start of the Iraq war.\n\nCornelia Beyer explains how terrorism increased as a response to past and present military intervention and occupation, as well as to 'structural violence'. Structural violence, in this instance, refers to economic conditions of backwardness which are attributed to the economic policies of the Western nations, the United States in particular.\n\nBritish Liberal Democrat politician Shirley Williams wrote that the United States and United Kingdom governments \"must stop to think whether it is sowing the kind of resentment which is the seedbed of future terrorism.\" The United Kingdom ambassador to Italy, Ivor Roberts, echoed this criticism when he stated that President Bush was \"the best recruiting sergeant ever for al Qaeda.\" \nThe United States also granted \"protected persons\" status under the Geneva Convention to the Mojahedin-e-Khalq, an Iranian group classified by the U.S. Department of State as a terrorist organization, sparking criticism. Other critics further noted that the American government granted political asylum to several alleged terrorists and terrorist organizations that seek to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime, while the American government claims to be anti-terrorism.\n\nIn 2018, \"New York Times\" terrorism reporter Rukmini Callimachi said \"there are more terrorists now than there are on the eve of September 11, not less...There are more terror groups now, not less.\"\n\nThe alleged mastermind behind the September 11, 2001 attacks was part of the mujahideen who were sponsored, armed, trained and aided by the CIA to fight the Soviet Union after it intervened in Afghanistan in 1979.\n\nVenezuela accused the U.S. government of having a double standard towards terrorism for giving safe haven to Luis Posada Carriles. Some Americans also commented on the selective use of the term War on Terrorism, including 3 star general William Odom, formerly President Reagan's NSA Director, who wrote:\n\nAs many critics have pointed, out, terrorism is not an enemy. It is a tactic. Because the United States itself has a long record of supporting terrorists and using terrorist tactics, the slogans of today's war on terrorism merely makes the United States look hypocritical to the rest of the world. A prudent American president would end the present policy of \"sustained hysteria\" over potential terrorist attacks..treat terrorism as a serious but not a strategic problem, encourage Americans to regain their confidence and refuse to let al Qaeda keep us in a state of fright.\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and members of his administration indicated they possessed information which demonstrated a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. Published reports of the links began in late December 1998. In January 1999, \"Newsweek\" magazine published a story about Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda joining forces to attack U.S. interests in the Gulf Region. ABC News broadcast a story of this link soon after. The Bush Administration believed there was a possibility of a potential collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime following the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan. Amnesty International Secretary General Irene Khan criticized the use of pro-humanitarian arguments by Coalition countries prior to its 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing in an open letter: \"This selective attention to human rights is nothing but a cold and calculated manipulation of the work of human rights activists. Let us not forget that these same governments turned a blind eye to Amnesty International's reports of widespread human rights violations in Iraq before the Gulf War.\"\n\nThe term \"torture by proxy\" is used by some critics to describe situations in which the CIA and other US agencies transferred supposed terrorists, whom they captured during their efforts in the 'War on terrorism', to countries known to employ torture as an interrogation technique. Some also claimed that US agencies knew torture was employed, even though the transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of US law. Nonetheless, Condoleezza Rice (then the United States Secretary of State) stated that:the United States has not transported anyone and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.\n\nThis US programme also prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states, including those related with the so-called War on Terrorism. A June 2006 report from the Council of Europe estimated that 100 people were kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory with the cooperation of Council of Europe members and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centres (\"black sites\"), some located in Europe, utilised by the CIA. According to the separate European Parliament report of February 2007, the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where these alleged 'terrorists' could face torture, in violation of article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\nOne aspect of the criticism regarding the rhetoric justifying the War on Terror was religionism, or more specifically Islamophobia. Theologian Amir Hussain, who studies contemporary Muslims societies in North America, defines this concept as a stereotyping of all followers of Islam as real or potential terrorists due to alleged hateful and violent teaching of their religion. He goes on to argue that \"Islam is reduced to the concept of jihad and Jihad is reduced to terror against the West.\" This line of argument echoes Edward Said’s famous piece \"Orientalism\" in which he argued that the United States sees the Muslims and Arabs in an essentialized caricatures – as oil supplies or potential terrorists.\n\nIn 2002, strong majorities supported the U.S.-led War on Terror in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, India and Russia, according to a sample survey conducted by the Pew Research Center. By 2006, supporters of the effort were in the minority in Britain (49%), Germany (47%), France (43%) and Japan (26%). Although a majority of Russians still supported the War on Terror, that majority had decreased by 21%. Whereas 63% of Spaniards supported the War on Terror in 2003, only 19% of the population indicated support in 2006. 19% of the Chinese population still supports the War on Terror and less than a fifth of the populations of Turkey, Egypt, as well as Jordan support the efforts. The report also indicated that Indian public support for the War on Terror has been stable. Andrew Kohut, while speaking to the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, noted that and according to the Pew Research Center polls conducted in 2004, \"the ongoing conflict in Iraq continues to fuel anti-American sentiments. America’s global popularity plummeted at the start of military action in Iraq and the U.S. presence there remains widely unpopular.\"\n\nMarek Obrtel, former Lieutenant Colonel in Field Hospital with Czech Republic army, returned his medals which he received during his posting in Afghanistan War for NATO operations. He criticized the War on Terror as describing the mission as \"deeply ashamed that I served a criminal organization such as NATO, led by the USA and its perverse interests around the world.\"\n\nResearchers in communication studies and political science found that American understanding of the \"War on Terror\" is directly shaped by how mainstream news media reports events associated with the conflict. In \"Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age\" political communication researcher Jim A. Kuypers illustrated \"how the press failed America in its coverage on the War on Terror.\" In each comparison, Kuypers \"detected massive bias on the part of the press.\" This researcher called the mainstream news media an \"anti-democratic institution\" in his conclusion. \"What has essentially happened since 9/11 has been that Bush has repeated the same themes and framed those themes the same whenever discussing the War on Terror,\" said Kuypers. \"Immediately following 9/11, the mainstream news media (represented by CBS, ABC, NBC, \"USA Today\", \"The New York Times\", as well as \"The Washington Post\") did echo Bush, but within eight weeks it began to intentionally ignore certain information the president was sharing and instead reframed the president's themes or intentionally introduced new material to shift the focus.\"\n\nThis goes beyond reporting alternate points of view, which is an important function of the press. \"In short,\" Kuypers explained, \"if someone were relying only on the mainstream media for information, they would have no idea what the president actually said. It was as if the press were reporting on a different speech.\" The study is essentially a \"comparative framing analysis.\" Overall, Kuypers examined themes about 9-11 and the War on Terror that President Bush used and compared them to themes that the press used when reporting on what he said.\n\n\"Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner,\" wrote Kuypers. These findings suggest that the public is misinformed about government justification and plans concerning the War on Terror.\n\nOthers have also suggested that press coverage contributed to a public confused and misinformed on both the nature and level of the threat to the U.S. posed by terrorism. In his book, \"Trapped in the War on Terror\" political scientist Ian S. Lustick, claimed, \"The media have given constant attention to possible terrorist-initiated catastrophes and to the failures and weaknesses of the government's response.\" Lustick alleged that the War on Terror is disconnected from the real but remote threat terrorism poses and that the generalized War on Terror began as part of the justification for invading Iraq, but then took on a life of its own, fueled by media coverage. Scott Atran writes that \"publicity is the oxygen of terrorism\" and the rapid growth of international communicative networks renders publicity even more potent, with the result that \"perhaps never in the history of human conflict have so few people with so few actual means and capabilities frightened so many.\"\n\nMedia researcher Stephen D. Cooper's analysis of media criticism \"Watching the Watchdog: Bloggers As the Fifth Estate\" contains several examples of controversies concerning mainstream reporting of the War on Terror. Cooper found that bloggers' criticisms of factual inaccuracies in news stories or bloggers' discovery of the mainstream press' failure to adequately verify facts before publication caused many news organizations to retract or change news stories.\n\nCooper found that bloggers specializing in criticism of media coverage advanced four key points:\n\nDavid Barstow won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting by connecting the Department of Defense to over 75 retired generals supporting the Iraq War on television and radio networks. The Department of Defense recruited retired generals to promote the war to the American public. Barstow also discovered undisclosed links between some retired generals and defense contractors. He reported that \"the Bush administration used its control over access of information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse\".\n\nThe Director of Public Prosecutions and head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the UK, Ken McDonald, Britain's most senior criminal prosecutor, stated that those responsible for acts of terrorism such as the 7 July 2005 London bombings are not \"soldiers\" in a war, but \"inadequates\" who should be dealt with by the criminal justice system. He added that a \"culture of legislative restraint\" was needed in passing anti-terrorism laws and that a \"primary purpose\" of the violent attacks was to tempt countries such as Britain to \"abandon our values.\" He stated that in the eyes of the UK criminal justice system, the response to terrorism had to be \"proportionate and grounded in due process and the rule of law\":\nLondon is not a battlefield. Those innocents who were murdered...were not victims of war. And the men who killed them were not, as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos, 'soldiers'. They were deluded, narcissistic inadequates. They were criminals. They were fantasists. We need to be very clear about this. On the streets of London there is no such thing as a war on terror. The fight against terrorism on the streets of Britain is not a war. It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement.\n\nStella Rimington, former head of the British intelligence service MI5 criticised the War on Terror as a \"huge overreaction\" and had decried the militarization and politicization of U.S. efforts to be the wrong approach to terrorism. David Miliband, former UK foreign secretary, has similarly called the strategy a \"mistake\". Nigel Lawson, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, called for Britain to end its involvement in the War in Afghanistan, describing the mission as \"wholly unsuccessful and indeed counter-productive.\"\n\n"}

The process of identification is subjective, and \"icons\" are judged by the extent to which they can be seen as an authentic proxy of that culture. When individuals perceive a cultural icon, they relate it to their general perceptions of the cultural identity represented. Cultural icons can also be identified as an authentic representation of the practices of one culture by another.\n\nIn the media, many items and persons of popular culture have been called \"iconic\" despite their lack of durability; and the term \"pop icon\" is often now used. Some commentators believe that the word is overused or misused.\n\nA web-based survey was set up in 2006 allowing the public to nominate their ideas for national icons of England and the results reflect the range of different types of icon associated with an English view of English culture. Some examples are:\n\n\nMatryoshka dolls are seen internationally as cultural icons of Russia. In the former Soviet Union, the hammer and sickle symbol and statues of Vladimir Lenin instead represented the country's most prominent cultural icons.\n\nThe values, norms and ideals represented by a cultural icon vary both among people who subscribe to it, and more widely among other people who may interpret cultural icons as symbolising quite different values. Thus an apple pie is a cultural icon of the United States, but its significance varies among Americans.\n\nNational icons can become targets for those opposing or criticising a regime, for example, crowds destroying statues of Lenin in Eastern Europe after the fall of communism or burning the American flag to protest US actions abroad.\n\nReligious icons can also become cultural icons in societies where religion and culture are deeply entwined, such as representations of the Madonna in societies with a strong Catholic tradition.\n\nDescribing something as \"iconic\" or as an \"icon\" has become very common in the popular media. This has drawn criticism from some: a writer in \"Liverpool Daily Post\" calls \"iconic\" \"a word that makes my flesh creep\", a word \"pressed into service to describe almost anything.\" The \"Christian Examiner\" nominates \"iconic\" in its list of overused words, finding over 18,000 \"iconic\" references in news stories alone, with another 30,000 for \"icon\", including its use for \"SpongeBob SquarePants\".\n\n\n\n"}

Cultural cognitive evolution proposes that humans’ unique cognitive capacities are not solely due to biological inheritance, but are in fact due in large part to cultural transmission and evolution (Tomasello, 1999). Modern humans and great apes are separated evolutionarily by about six million years. Proponents of cultural evolution argue that this would not have been enough time for humans to develop the advanced cognitive capabilities required to create tools, language, and build societies through biological evolution. Biological evolution could not have individually produced each of these cognitive capabilities within that period of time. Instead, humans must have evolved the capacity to learn through cultural transmission (Tomasello, 1999). This provides a more plausible explanation that would fit within the given time frame. Instead of having to biologically account for each cognitive mechanism that distinguishes modern humans from previous relatives, one would only have to account for one significant biological adaptation for cultural learning. According to this view, the ability to learn through cultural transmission is what distinguishes humans from other primates (Tomasello, 1999). Cultural learning allows humans to build on existing knowledge and make collective advancements, also known as the “ratchet effect”. The ratchet effect simply refers to the way in which humans continuously add on to existing knowledge through modifications and improvements. This unique ability distinguishes humans from related primates, who do not seem to build collaborative knowledge over time. Instead, primates seem to build individual knowledge, in which the expertise of one animal is not built on by others, and does not progress across time.\n\nHuman cultural learning involves:\nCultural learning is made possible by a deep understanding of social cognition. Humans have the unique capacity to identify and relate to others and view them as intentional beings. Humans are able to understand that others have intentions, goals, desires, and beliefs. It is this deep understanding, this cognitive adaptation, that allows humans to learn from and with others through cultural transmission (Tomasello, 1999).\n\nPrimates show distinct characteristics of social cognition in comparison to mammals. Mammals are able to identify members of their species, understand basic kinships and basic social hierarchies, make predictions about others’ behavior based on emotion and movement, and engage in social learning (Tomasello, 1999). Primates, however, show a more extensive understanding of these concepts. Primates not only understand kinship and social hierarchies, but they also have an understanding of relational categories. That is, primates are able to understand social relations that extend beyond their individual interaction with others. Mammals are able to form direct relationships based on social hierarchies, but primates have an understanding of social hierarchies and relationships that extend beyond them personally. Researchers believe that this understanding of relational categories might have been the evolutionary precursor to humans’ deeper understanding of desires, beliefs, and goals underlying causal relationships, and thereby allowing humans to relate to and understand other individuals, making way for cultural evolution (Tomasello, 1999).\n\nAlthough it is now believed that non-human primates such as chimpanzees have some limited understanding of others as intentional beings, it is clear that these understanding are not as deep as human understanding of others as intentional agents. Chimpanzees, for example, demonstrated an ability to think about what others see, and predict behavior based on these beliefs in several studies conducted by Tomasello and Hare (2003). For example, subordinate chimpanzees in one experiment avoided food that they knew the dominant chimpanzee could see, but sought food that the dominant chimpanzee could not see due to a physical barrier. In another experiment, subordinate chimpanzees made decisions about approaching food based on whether or not the dominant chimpanzee had seen the human researcher place the food behind the barrier. Chimpanzees were also found to react differently to humans who were unwilling versus unable to provide food (teasing the chimpanzee with food, or pretending to have an accident with it), thereby showing some ability to discriminate intentionality.\n\nDogs have also shown some interesting but limited abilities at social cognition in a series of studies by Hare and Tomasello (2005). Dogs have the ability to read human social cues, even to a greater extent than chimpanzees. Dogs are able to respond to human pointing, the human gaze, and subtle human nods without training. Researchers now believe that these abilities are the result of convergent evolution between humans and dogs through domestication. Research with domesticated foxes has shown that the likely mechanism for this convergent evolution was the selection of tame behavior in dogs. This finding suggests that perhaps humans had to evolve a propensity to cooperate before cultural evolution was able to take place (Hare & Tomasello, 2005).\n\nSociogenesis refers to collaborative inventiveness. It is the process by which two or more humans collectively interact and invent something new which could not have been developed by one individual alone, such as language and mathematics (Tomasello, 1999). Sociogenesis can occur across time, or simultaneously (Tomasello, 1999). Socigenesis across times occurs through the ratchet effect, when one individual modifies something they had previously learned through others. Over time, ideas, tools, and language advance. Simultaneous sociogenesis occurs when two or more individuals work together at the same time and develop something new.\n\nIn response to the nature versus nurture and learned versus innate debate, proponents of cultural evolution argue that cognitive psychology must take into account historical processes when studying and discussion cognition (Tomasello, 1999). For example, the similarities between languages have led many researchers to decry that language or aspects of language must be innate. The extreme variability in math and counting systems across cultures has prevented similar conclusions for math. However, Tomasello argues that if you look at these concepts with historical processes in mind, another plausible explanation could be that language, but not math, developed before people split into different populations. Math developed only after such split, and because the cultural needs of these people differed, differential counting and mathematical systems resulted. The critique is that categorizing concepts as innate or learned does not tell us anything about the process by which they originally developed.\n\n Hare, B., & Tomasello, M. (2005).

Items like bricks could be considered perfectly durable goods because they should theoretically never wear out. Highly durable goods such as refrigerators or cars usually continue to be useful for three or more years of use, so durable goods are typically characterized by long periods between successive purchases.\n\nExamples of consumer durable goods include automobiles, books, household goods (home appliances, consumer electronics, furniture, tools, etc.), sports equipment, jewelry, medical equipment, firearms, and toys.\n\nNondurable goods or soft goods (consumables) are the opposite of durable goods. They may be defined either as goods that are immediately consumed in one use or ones that have a lifespan of less than three years.\n\nExamples of nondurable goods include fast-moving consumer goods such as cosmetics and cleaning products, food, condiments, fuel, beer, cigarettes and tobacco, medication, office supplies, packaging and containers, paper and paper products, personal products, rubber, plastics, textiles, clothing, and footwear.\n\nWhile durable goods can usually be rented as well as bought, nondurable goods generally are not rented. While buying durable goods comes under the category of investment demand of goods, buying non-durables comes under the category of consumption demand of goods.\n\nAccording to Cooper (1994, p5) \"durability is the ability of a product to perform its required function over a lengthy period under normal conditions of use without excessive expenditure on maintenance or repair\". Several units may be used to measure the durability of a product according to its field of application such as years of existence, hours of use and operational cycles.\n\nThe life span of household goods is significant for sustainable consumption. The longer product life spans could contribute to eco-efficiency and sufficiency, thus, slowing consumption in order to progress towards a sustainable consumption. Cooper (2005) proposed a model to demonstrate the crucial role of product life spans to sustainable production and consumption.\n\nDurability as a characteristic relating to the quality of goods, that can be demanded by consumers, was not clear until an amendment of the law relating to the quality standards for supplied goods in 1994[5].\n\n"}

By cutting through all fetters, one attains nibbāna (Pali; Skt.: \"nirvāa\").\n\nThroughout the Pali canon, the word \"fetter\" is used to describe an intrapsychic phenomenon that ties one to suffering. For instance, in the Khuddaka Nikaya's Itivuttaka 1.15, the Buddha states:\n\nElsewhere, the suffering caused by a fetter is \"implied\" as in this more technical discourse from SN 35.232, where Ven. Sariputta converses with Ven. Kotthita:\n\nThe fetters are enumerated in different ways in the Pali canon's Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka.\n\nThe Pali canon's Sutta Pitaka identifies ten \"fetters of becoming\":\n\nAs indicated in the adjacent table, throughout the Sutta Pitaka, the first five fetters are referred to as \"lower fetters\" (\"orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni\") and are eradicated upon becoming a non-returner; and, the last five fetters are referred to as \"higher fetters\" (\"uddhambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni\"), eradicated by an arahant.\n\nBoth the Sagīti Sutta (DN 33) and the Dhammasai (Dhs. 1002-1006) refer to the \"three fetters\" as the first three in the aforementioned Sutta Pitaka list of ten:\nAccording to the Canon, these three fetters are eradicated by stream-enterers and once-returners.\n\nThe Abhidhamma Pitaka's Dhamma Sangani (Dhs. 1113-34) provides an alternate list of ten fetters, also found in the Khuddaka Nikaya's Culla Niddesa (Nd2 656, 1463) and in post-canonical commentaries. This enumeration is: \nThe commentary mentions that views, doubt, attachment to rites and rituals, jealousy and greed are thrown off at the first stage of Awakening (sotāpatti); gross sensual lust and anger by the second stage (sakadāgāmitā) and even subtle forms of the same by the third stage (anāgāmitā); and conceit, lust for existence and ignorance by the fourth and final stage (arahatta).\n\nUniquely, the Sutta Pitaka's \"Householder Potaliya\" Sutta (MN 54), identifies \"eight\" fetters (including three of the Five Precepts) whose abandonment \"lead[s] to the cutting off of affairs\" (\"vohāra-samucchedāya saṃvattanti\"): \n\nFor English translations, see \n\nThe following fetters are the first three mentioned in the aforementioned Sutta Pitaka list of ten fetters, and the Sagīti Sutta's and the Abhidhamma Pitaka's list of \"three fetters\" (DN 33, Dhs. 1002 \"ff\".). As indicated below, eradication of these three fetters is a canonical indicator of one's being irreversibly established on the path to Enlightenment.\n\nEtymologically, \"kāya\" means \"body,\" \"sakkāya\" means \"existing body,\" and \"\" means \"view\" (here implying a \"wrong\" view, as exemplified by the views in the table below).\n\nIn general, \"belief in an individual self\" or, more simply, \"self view\" refers to a \"belief that in one or other of the khandhas there is a permanent entity, an \"attā\".\"\n\nSimilarly, in MN 2, the Sabbasava Sutta, the Buddha describes \"a fetter of views\" in the following manner:\n\nIn general, \"doubt\" (vicikicchā) refers to doubt about the Buddha's teachings, the Dhamma. (Alternate contemporaneous teachings are represented in the adjacent table.)\n\nMore specifically, in SN 22.84, the Tissa Sutta, the Buddha explicitly cautions against uncertainty regarding the Noble Eightfold Path, which is described as the right path to Nibbana, leading one past ignorance, sensual desire, anger and despair.\n\n\"Śīla\" refers to \"moral conduct\", \"vata\" (or \"bata\") to \"religious duty, observance, rite, practice, custom,\" and \"parāmāsa\" to \"being attached to\" or \"a contagion\" and has the connotation of \"mishandling\" the Dhamma. Altogether, \"sīlabbata-parāmāso\" has been translated as \"the contagion of mere rule and ritual, the infatuation of good works, the delusion that they suffice\" or, more simply, \"fall[ing] back on attachment to precepts and rules.\"\n\nWhile the fetter of doubt can be seen as pertaining to the teachings of competing \"samana\" during the times of the Buddha, this fetter regarding rites and rituals likely refers to some practices of contemporary brahmanic authorities.\n\nIn MN 64, the \"Greater Discourse to Mālunkyāputta,\" the Buddha states that the path to abandoning the five lower fetters (that is, the \"first\" five of the aforementioned \"ten fetters\") is through using jhana attainment and vipassana insights in tandem. In SN 35.54, \"Abandoning the Fetters,\" the Buddha states that one abandons the fetters \"when one knows and sees ... as impermanent\" (Pali: \"anicca\") the twelve sense bases (\"āyatana\"), the associated six sense-consciousness (\"\"), and the resultant contact (\"phassa\") and sensations (\"vedanā\"). Similarly, in SN 35.55, \"Uprooting the Fetters,\" the Buddha states that one uproots the fetters \"when one knows and sees ... as nonself\" (\"anatta\") the sense bases, sense consciousness, contact and sensations.\n\nThe Pali canon traditionally describes cutting through the fetters in four stages:\n\nSimilar Buddhist concepts found throughout the Pali Canon include the five hindrances (\"nīvaraāni\") and the ten defilements (\"kilesā\"). Comparatively speaking, in the Theravada tradition, fetters span multiple lifetimes and are difficult to remove, while hindrances are transitory obstacles. Defilements encompass \"all\" mental defilements including both fetters and hindrances.\n\n\n\n"}

The tradition originates with the mason's marks used in the Middle Ages.\n\nThese marks have the appearance of glyphs or runes consisting of a pattern of simple lines, without the application of colour.\n\nThe purpose of a house mark is to have a recognisable mark that a person, a nuclear family, multiple generations of an extended family or an owner of a property can use to mark objects, cattle or buildings for recognition of ownership. The use of house marks dates back to long before writing was public knowledge.\n\nBesides farmers, house marks have also been used by merchants, tradesman, artisans and other town burghers on for example Bryggen in Bergen, on building blocks in the Nidaros Cathedral, and on personal seals in other Norwegian cities. There are also house marks written by hand on documents, for instance house marks of mining workers at Røros.\n\nThe Norwegian word \"bomerke\" or \"boemerke\" probably came from Denmark. There is no Norwegian reference before the 17th century. Today \"bomerke\" is mainly written as \"bumerke\" in Norwegian. Both in Denmark and Sweden, the word bomerke (with multiple spellings) is used since the 14th century and in the 16th century. In the Icelandic codes of law from the Middle Ages, one finds the word \"einkunn\" used to denote owner marks used to tag animals. It is likely that this word has also been used in Norway.\n\nIn Finnish, the word \"puumerkki\" (\"insignia\") means a distinguishing mark or sign used by illiterate persons as a replacement of a written signature in official documents.\n\nThe form of house marks is based on function. They should be easy to cut, scratch or engrave with a knife or similar tool. At the same time, they should be distinctive and easy to remember. House marks differ from the more complicated patterns of a coat of arms or flags, which include surfaces and solid colors.\n\nHouse marks can be made from one or two lines and up to quite a complex pattern of line figures. Based on appearance, house marks resemble line figures in rock carvings and in early writing systems. It is unclear how extensively such ancient line figures were used as marks for people or property ownership.\n\nThe basic forms of a house mark is often runes, characters and numbers, stylized figures, international symbols like crosses, stars, and astrological or astronomical characters.\n\nOne characteristic of house marks is that they may consist of a basic form with addition or deduction of lines. In this way, related people can have marks that resemble each other, but differ by details. This is equivalent to cadency and adding brisures as a method to change a coat of arms.\n\nMany house marks are placed in shield-shaped frames. We see this in seals, on buildings and on tombstones, for both farmers and city dwellers in Scandinavia and German areas, during the 1700s and 1800s. Some of these house mark shields also had color and approached the heraldic coat of arms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "683907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=683907", "title": "Jouissance", "text": "Jouissance\n\nIn French, jouissance means enjoyment, in terms both of rights and property, and of sexual orgasm—the latter has a meaning partially lacking in the English word \"enjoyment\".\n\nPoststructuralism has developed the latter sense of \"jouissance\" in complex ways, so as to denote a transgressive, excessive kind of pleasure linked to the division and splitting of the subject involved.\n\nEnglish editions of the works of Jacques Lacan have generally left \"jouissance\" untranslated in order to help convey its specialised usage. Lacan first developed his concept of an opposition between \"jouissance\" and the pleasure principle in his Seminar \"The Ethics of Psychoanalysis\" (1959–1960). Lacan considered that \"there is a \"jouissance\" beyond the pleasure principle\" linked to the partial drive; a \"jouissance\" which compels the subject to constantly attempt to transgress the prohibitions imposed on his enjoyment, to go beyond the pleasure principle.\n\nYet the result of transgressing the pleasure principle, according to Lacan, is not more pleasure but pain, since there is only a certain amount of pleasure that the subject can bear. Beyond this limit, pleasure becomes pain, and this \"painful principle\" is what Lacan calls \"jouissance\". Thus \"jouissance\" is suffering (\"ethics\")—something which may be linked to the influence of the erotic philosophy of Bataille, epitomised in Lacan's remark about \"the recoil imposed on everyone, in so far as it involves terrible promises, by the approach of \"jouissance\" as such\". Lacan also linked \"jouissance\" to the castration complex, and to the aggression of the death drive.\n\nIn his seminar \"The Other Side of Psychoanalysis\" (1969–1970) Lacan introduced the concept of \"surplus-\"jouissance\"\" (French \"plus-de-jouir\") inspired by Marx's concept of surplus-value: he considered \"objet petit a\" is the excess of \"jouissance\" which has no use value, and which persists for the mere sake of \"jouissance\".\n\nLacan considered that \"jouissance\" is essentially phallic, meaning that it does not relate to the \"Other\" as such. In his seminar \"Encore\" (1972–1973), however, Lacan introduced the idea of specifically feminine \"jouissance\", saying that women have \"in relation to what the phallic function designates of \"jouissance\", a supplementary \"jouissance\"...a \"jouissance\" of the body which is...\"beyond the phallus\"\". This feminine \"jouissance\" is ineffable, for both women and men may experience it but know nothing about it.\n\nThe Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek, a known Lacanian theorist, has adopted the term in his philosophy; it may also be seen in the works, both joint and individual, of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and it plays an important role in the writing of Julia Kristeva and Roland Barthes.\n\nIn his 1973 literary theory book \"The Pleasure of the Text\", Barthes divides the effects of texts into two: \"plaisir\" (translated as \"pleasure\") and \"jouissance\". The distinction corresponds to a further distinction Barthes makes between \"readerly\" and \"writerly\" texts. The pleasure of the text corresponds to the readerly text, which does not challenge the reader's position as a subject. The writerly text provides bliss, which explodes literary codes and allows the reader to break out of his or her subject position.\n\nFor Barthes \"plaisir\" is, \"a pleasure... linked to cultural enjoyment and identity, to the cultural enjoyment of identity, to a homogenising movement of the ego.\" As Richard Middleton puts it, \"\"Plaisir\" results, then, from the operation of the structures of signification through which the subject knows himself or herself; \"jouissance\" fractures these structures.\"\n\nThe French feminist writer Hélène Cixous uses the term \"jouissance\" to describe a form of women's pleasure or sexual rapture that combines mental, physical and spiritual aspects of female experience, bordering on mystical communion: \"explosion, diffusion, effervescence, abundance...takes pleasure (jouit) in being limitless\". Cixous maintains that \"jouissance\" is the source of a woman's creative power and that the suppression of \"jouissance\" prevents women from finding their own fully empowered voice. The concept of \"jouissance\" is explored by Cixous and other authors in their writings on \"Écriture féminine\", a strain of feminist literary theory that originated in France in the early 1970s.\n\nOther feminists have argued that Freudian \"hysteria\" is \"jouissance\" distorted by patriarchal culture and say that \"jouissance\" is a transcendent state that represents freedom from oppressive linearities. In her introduction to Cixous' \"The Newly Born Woman\", literary critic Sandra Gilbert writes: \"to escape hierarchical bonds and thereby come closer to what Cixous calls \"jouissance\", which can be defined as a virtually metaphysical fulfillment of desire that goes far beyond [mere] satisfaction... [It is a] fusion of the erotic, the mystical, and the political.\"\n\n\n"}

He has not seen his parents in over 15 years. He adopted the name \"Ka Hsaw Wa\", which means \"the White Elephant\", while in exile in the United States. White Elephants are traditionally thought of by the Karen people as symbolizing righteousness and strength as well as a harbinger of great positive change.\n\nKa Hsaw Wa grew up in Burma as the son of a doctor and enjoyed relative economic privilege in his youth. However, when he entered college he soon became active in political causes, and quickly developed into a strong student leader. The Burmese government attacked the students brutally in 1988, killing many. Ka Hsaw Wa was captured and tortured. He then left Burma, but re-entered the country in order to participate in a lengthy photographic campaign documenting environmental and indigenous destruction, as well as severe human rights abuses, including starvation, systematic rape, and the destruction of entire villages. Most of the problems he documented were connected to the construction and operation of a petroleum pipeline in the area of Yadana for the oil companies Unocal (U.S.-based) and Total S.A. (based in France).\n\nKa Hsaw Wa, Katie Redford and EarthRights launched a federal lawsuit against Unocal, employing a unique legal strategy utilizing the U.S. Alien Tort Statute of 1789, which says that \"federal courts have jurisdiction for torts that occur in violation of the Law of Nations, [which] includes abuses of fundamental human rights [and] genocide\", in order to force the company to assume responsibility for human rights abuses caused by its actions. In the case Unocal eventually agreed to pay compensation to the 15 anonymous villagers who suffered forced labor, rape, and the effects of killings.\n\nKa Hsaw Wa continues his front-line activism, and was featured in the 2006 film, \"Total Denial\". A description based on his role in the film is as follows:\n\n\"Ka Hsaw Wa dedicated his life to human rights activism, speaking fluent English and Burmese, dodging back and forth as he plays cat-and-mouse with the border guards, marrying another rights worker and even raising a family. All the while he is fighting to live and protect his homeland. At one point he describes how he was himself tortured. When he goes into difficult areas of the jungle, he takes a gun with a single bullet - to commit suicide if captured (to avoid torture).\"\nKa Hsaw Wa and EarthRights are also involved in the current struggle for democracy and human rights in Burma, wherein a number of protesters, including monks, have been killed, and hundreds of protesters arrested. They are working to bring an end to the current violence against the people. In response to the 2007 protests, Ka Hsaw Wa has said:\n\"As someone who experienced this regime's brutality in 1988, I am glad that this time around, the world is watching. But that is not enough. The international community, including multinational corporations, must act now to prevent further bloodshed in Burma. The people have suffered profoundly for too long — they have already sacrificed so much, and they will not stop.\"\n\n"}

The concept of the looking-glass self describes the development of one's self and of one's identity through one's interpersonal interactions within the context of society. Cooley clarified that society is an interweaving and inter-working of mental selves. The term \"looking glass self\" was coined by Cooley in his work, \"Human Nature and the Social Order\" in 1902.\n\nThe looking-glass self has three major components and is unique to humans (Shaffer 2005). According to Lisa McIntyre’s \"The Practical Skeptic: Core Concepts in Sociology\", the concept of the looking-glass self expresses the tendency for one to understand oneself through their own understanding of the perception which others may hold of them. This process is theorized to develop one's sense of identity. Therefore identity, or self, is the result of learning to see ourselves as others do (Yeung & Martin 2003). \n\nIn hypothesizing the framework, \"the mind is mental\" because \"the human mind is social\". From the time they are born, humans define themselves within the context of their social interactions. The child learns that the symbol of his/her crying will elicit a response from his/her caregivers, not only when they are in need of necessities such as food or a diaper change, but also when the child is in need of attention. Schubert references Cooley's \"On Self and Social Organization\", \"a growing solidarity between mother and child parallels the child's increasing competence in using significant symbols. This simultaneous development is itself a necessary prerequisite for the child's ability to adopt the perspectives of other participants in social relationships and, thus, for the child's capacity to develop a social self.\"\n\nGeorge Herbert Mead described the creation of the self as the outcome of \"taking the role of the other\", the premise for which the self is actualized. Through interaction with others, we begin to develop an identity of our own as well as developing a capacity to empathize with others. As stated by Cooley, \"The thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another's mind\" (Cooley 1964).\n\nThe looking-glass self comprises three main components (Yeung & Martin 2003).\n\n\nThe term \"looking-glass self\" was coined by Cooley after extensive psychological testing in 1902. In 1976 Arthur L Beaman, Edward Diener, and Soren Svanum (1979) performed an experiment on the looking-glass self’s effect on children. Another study in the Journal of Family Psychology in 1998, measured the validity of the looking glass self and symbolic interaction in the context of familial relationships.\n\nOn Halloween night, 363 children trick-or-treated at 18 different homes in Seattle, Washington. Each of these 18 homes was selected to take part in the experiment and was in turn arranged in similar ways. In a room near the entry way there was a low table and on it was a large bowl full of bite sized candy. A festive backdrop was also placed in sight of the candy bowl with a small hole for viewing; behind the backdrop was an observer who would record the results of the experiment. The experiment was conducted in the same way at each of the 18 different homes, with each home conducting two different conditions of the experiment, self-awareness manipulation and individuation manipulation. All of the homes conducted both conditions; half of the homes conducting self-awareness manipulation while the other half conducted individuation manipulation. In each of the conditions a woman would answer the door commenting on the children’s costumes and inviting them in. She would then instruct the children to take only one piece of candy from the bowl and excuse herself to another room.\n\nSelf-awareness manipulation was the first of two conditions performed in Beaman, Diener, and Svanum’s experiment. The self-awareness manipulation condition was performed with a mirror placed at a ninety degree angle directly behind the entry-way table fifty percent of the time. The mirror was placed in such a way that the children could always see their reflection in the mirror when taking candy from the bowl; the other half of the time there was no mirror in place and the children were left anonymous.\n\nThere was some concern that the children involved in the study would only see their Halloween costumes and not their own self reflections, so a second condition was performed in Beaman, Diener, and Svanum's experiment. This second condition was called individuation manipulation. The individuation manipulation condition was performed in the same way as the self-awareness manipulation. After greeting the children the woman at the door would ask each of the children their name and where he or she lived. These questions were asked in such a way that the children would think nothing of it because many other homes asked the children their names on Halloween night; however, no effort was made to identify the children involved. Just as in the first condition, a mirror was used half of the time and was removed for the other half of the experiment.\n\nThe children involved in the experiment were split into several different categories based on the results of the experiment. The criteria consisted of age, group size, and gender. Out of the 363 children involved in the study, 70 children transgressed when instructed not to. Children who arrived in groups were more likely to transgress than those children who arrived alone; 20.4% to 10.3% respectively. Children arriving with adults were not included in the study.\n\nThe genders of those who participated in the study were recorded by the unobtrusive observer from behind the festive backdrop. Out of the 363 children, only 326 children’s genders could be determined because they were wearing Halloween costumes. Of those children whose genders could be determined there were 190 boys and 136 girls. While Cooley suggests that girls have a far higher impressionable social sensibility it was not the case in this study, as boys transgressed more often than girls. Fewer boys transgressed with the mirror present, than without; 15.6% to 35.8%. This trend was the same for girls; 8.4% to 13.2%.\n\nWhile the exact age of each child could not be determined due to the children’s anonymity, approximate ages were given to each child by the unobtrusive observer. The average age of the children was eight years old. The results of the study were split up into different categories based on the approximate age given to each child. The age groups were as follows: ages 1–4, 5–8, 9–12 and 13 or older. The rate of transgression rose with the age of the child; the 1–4 year olds had a rate of transgression of only 6.5% while the 5–8 year olds transgressed 9.7% of the time. The two older age groups transgressed far more often than the younger groups; children aged 9–12 transgressed 23.6% of the time while the children aged 13 and older had a rate of transgression of 41.9%.\n\nThe research article was included in the Journal of Family Psychology in 1998. The researchers, Cook and Douglas, measured the validity of the looking glass self and symbolic interaction in the context of familial relationships. The study analyzed the accuracy of a college student's and an adolescent's perceptions of how they are perceived by their parents. The 51 participants of this study included four family members (mother, father, college student and adolescent) who returned surveys. The families were primarily white and middle class. The college student and adolescent were paid ten dollars each, if each family member completed the survey.\n\nThree areas were investigated: assertiveness, firmness, and cooperation. In reference to the three areas respondents were asked the following: how they behave toward the target, how the target behaves toward them, and how they think they are viewed by the target. The study identified the looking glass self as a \"metaperception\" because it involves \"perception of perceptions.\" One of the hypotheses tested in the study was: If \"metaperceptions\" cause self-perceptions they will necessarily be coordinated. The hypothesis was tested at the individual and relationship levels of analysis\n\nThe study determined that the hypothesis is strongly supported at the individual level for cooperation for both college students and adolescents, but is only partially supported for assertiveness for college students. Also for college students, at the relationship level with their mothers the study supported assertiveness. There was an irregular finding regarding firmness in the mother-adolescent relationship that indicated that the firmer adolescents were perceived by their mothers, the less firm they rated themselves in the relationship. While there was not strong support of the hypothesis on the relationship level, on the individual level the findings suggest that how college students and adolescents think about themselves is directly correlated to how they think they are perceived by their parents.\n\nIt has been argued that the looking glass self conceptualization of the social self is critically incomplete in that it overlooks the divergent roles of ingroups and outgroups in self-definition. That is, it has been demonstrated that while individuals will converge upon the attitudes and behaviours of ingroup members, they will also diverge from the attitudes and behaviours of outgroup members. The neglect of the latter scenario is attributed to the looking glass approaches’ implicit focus on ingroup member appraisals. This alternative perspective is derived from the self-categorization theory analysis of social influence. Indeed, it is further argued that the looking glass self metaphor fails to reflect the fact that influence derives from the self-categorization of other individuals as part of the self. In other words, people are not shaped by the reflections from ‘others’, but rather are shaped by the creation of a collective social identity that contrasts ‘us’ \"against\" relevant ‘others’. Therefore, the concept of self-identity may be considered an example of a social construction.\n\n"}

It is therefore sometimes also referred to as regional, national or economy-wide material flow analysis.\n\nMaterial flow accounting provides economy-wide data on material use. Through international standardization, this data has become reliable and comparable across countries. Increasingly, the data are also being made available in medium- to long-term time series allowing for the analysis of past trends as well as potential future developments. Material flow accounts provide information on the material inputs into, the changes in material stock within, and the material outputs in the form of exports to other economies or discharges to the environment of an economy. Material flow accounting can be used in national planning, especially for scarce resources, and also allows for forecasting. The method can be used to assess environmental burdens associated with the economic activities of a nation and to determine how material intensive an economy is.\nThe principle concept underlying MFA is a simple model of this interrelation between the economy and the environment, in which the economy is an embedded subsystem of the environment. Similar to living beings, this subsystem is dependent on a constant throughput of materials and energy. Raw materials, water and air are extracted from the natural system as inputs, transformed into products and finally re-transferred to the natural system as outputs (waste and emissions). In order to highlight the similarity to natural metabolic processes, the terms “industrial” or “societal” metabolism have been introduced.\nIn MFA studies for a region or on a national level the flows of materials between the natural environment and the economy are analyzed and quantified on a physical level. The focus may be on individual substances (e.g. Cadmium flows), specific materials, or bulk material flows (e.g. steel and steel scrap flows within an economy).\nResearchers in this field are organized in the Socio-Economic Metabolism (SEM) section of the International Society for Industrial Ecology (ISIE).\n\nStatistics related to material flow accounting are usually compiled by national statistical offices, using economic, agricultural and trade statistics measuring the exchange of material between different products available in an economy.\n\nAside from calculating the net additions to stock (NAS) as a balancing item, flows within the economy are not considered (advances are currently being made in the field of dynamic stock modelling). MFA covers all solid, gaseous, and liquid materials, mobilized by humans or by their livestock, with the exception of bulk water and air. The unit of measurement is most commonly (metric) tonnes per year (t/a). Flows are distinguished by whether they are extracted domestically (domestic extraction, DE) or are trade flows (imports or exports). Materials are most commonly grouped according to four main material categories: biomass, fossil energy carriers, metals, and non-metallic minerals. The former category may be further differentiated by type of use into industrial and construction minerals. It is very important to note that MFA seeks to provide a complete picture of an economy’s material use so that materials are included in these accounts irrespective of whether or not they have direct market value. The most prominent non-market flows covered by MFA are grazed biomass and used crop residues as well as waste rock extracted during mining activities. In 2010, these material flows accounted for 21% of global extraction.\nThe data collected in MFA is used to calculate several different standardized indicators:\nDirect Material Input (DMI) is a measure of the total material inputs into an economy and is calculated as the sum of domestic extraction (DE) and imports.\nThe Physical Trade Balance (PTB) is a measure of net-imports and is calculated as the difference between imports and exports. Reflecting that material and money flow in opposite directions during trade, this is a contrast to the monetary trade balance which calculates net-exports.\nDomestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a measure of apparent consumption and calculated from domestic extraction plus imports minus exports (or DE plus PTB).\nEconomy-wide MFA is a satellite system to the system of national accounts and provides a rich empirical database for analytical studies. More information on how the statistics are collected, under what legal framework and how they are defined is available on Economy-wide material flow accounts.\n\nIn addition, the following indicators are may be used in material flow accounting:\n\n\n"}

In physics, the microscopic scale is sometimes regarded as the scale between the macroscopic scale and the quantum scale. Microscopic units and measurements are used to classify and describe very small objects. One common microscopic length scale unit is the micrometre (also called a \"micron\") (symbol: μm), which is one millionth of a metre.\n\nBy convention, the microscopic scale also includes classes of objects that are most commonly too small to see but of which some members are large enough to be observed with the eye. Such groups include the \"Cladocera\", planktonic green algae of which \"Volvox\" is readily observable, and the protozoa of which \"stentor\" can be easily seen without aid.\nThe submicroscopic scale similarly includes objects that are too small to see with an optical microscope.\n\n"}
{"id": "54409102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54409102", "title": "Model-based enterprise", "text": "Model-based enterprise\n\nModel-based enterprise (MBE) is a term used in manufacturing, to describe a strategy where an annotated digital three-dimensional (3D) model of a product serves as the authoritative information source for all activities in that product's lifecycle.\n\nA key advantage of MBE is that it replaces 2D drawings. In MBE, a single 3D model contains all the information typically found on in an entire set of engineering drawings, including geometry, topology, dimensions, tolerances, materials, finishes, and weld call-outs.\n\nMBE was originally championed by the aerospace and defense industries, with the automotive industry following. It has been adopted by many manufacturers around the world, in a wide range of industries. Significant benefits for manufacturers include reduced time to market and savings in production costs from improved tool design and fabrication, fewer overall assembly hours, less rework, streamlined development and better collaboration on engineering changes.\n\nThere are two prerequisites to implementing MBE: The first is the creation of annotated 3D models, known as a Model-based definitions (MBD). This requires the use of a CAD system capable of creating precise solid models, with product and manufacturing information (PMI), a form of 3D annotation which may include dimensions, GD&T, notes, surface finish, and material specifications. (The mechanical CAD systems used in aerospace, defense, and automotive industries generally have these capabilities.) The second prerequisite is transforming MBDs into a form where they can be used in downstream lifecycle activities. As a rule, CAD models are stored in proprietary data formats, so they must be translated to a suitable MBD-compatible standard format, such as 3D PDF, JT, STEP AP 242, or ANSI QIF\n\nThe core MBE tenet is that models are used to drive all aspects of the product lifecycle and that data is created once and reused by all downstream data consumers. Data reusability requires computer interpretability, where an MBD can be processed directly by downstream applications, and associativity of PMI to specific model features within the MBD.\n\nHistorically, engineering and manufacturing activities have relied on hardcopy and/or digital documents (including 2D drawings) to convey engineering data and drive manufacturing processes. These documents required interpretation by skilled practitioners, often leading to ambiguities and errors.\n\nIn the 1980s, improvements in 3D solid modeling made it possible for CAD systems to precisely represent the shape of most manufactured goods—however, even enthusiastic adopters of solid modeling technology continued to rely upon 2D drawings (often CAD generated) as the authority (or master) product representation. 3D models, even if geometrically accurate, lacked a method to represent dimensions, tolerances, and other annotative information required to drive manufacturing processes.\n\nIn the early-to-middle 2000s, the ASME Y14.41-2003 Digital Product Data Definition Practices and ISO 16792:2006 Technical product documentation -- Digital product definition data practices standards were released, providing support for PMI annotations in 3D CAD models, and introducing the concept of MBD (or, alternatively, digital product definition)\n\nThe model-based enterprise concept first appeared about 2005. Initially it was construed broadly, referring to the pervasive use of modeling and simulation technologies (of almost any type) throughout an enterprise. In the late 2000s, An active community advocating development of MBE grew, based on the collaborative efforts of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Army Research Laboratory, Armament Research Development Engineering Center (ARDEC), Army ManTech, BAE Systems, NIST, and the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP). The \"MBE Team\" included industry participants such as General Dynamics, Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, Elysium, Adobe, EOS, ITI TranscenData, Vistagy, PTC, Dassault Systemes Delmia, Boeing, and BAE Systems.\n\nOver time, based on community feedback, MBE became more narrowly construed, referring to the use of MBD data to drive product lifecycle activities. In 2011, the MBE Team published these definitions:\n\n\nBy 2015, with improvements to ASME Y14.41 and ISO 16792, and the development of open CAD data exchange standards capable of adequately representing PMI, MBE started to become more widely adopted by manufacturers.\n"}
{"id": "300468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300468", "title": "Monica Seles", "text": "Monica Seles\n\nMonica Seles (; , ; ; born December 2, 1973) is a retired American and Yugoslav professional tennis player, who last represented the United States and is also a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame. An ethnic Hungarian, she was born and raised in Novi Sad, SFR Yugoslavia. She became a naturalized American citizen in 1994 and also received Hungarian citizenship in June 2007. A former world no. 1, she won nine Grand Slam singles titles, eight of them as a teenager while representing Yugoslavia, and the final one while representing the United States.\n\nIn 1990, Seles became the youngest ever French Open champion at the age of 16. She went on to win eight Grand Slam singles titles before her 20th birthday and was the year-end world no. 1 in 1991 and 1992. However, on April 30, 1993, she was the victim of an on-court attack, when a man stabbed her in the back with a long knife. Seles did not return to tennis for over two years. Though she enjoyed some success after rejoining the tour in 1995, including a fourth Australian Open title in 1996, she was unable to consistently reproduce her best form. She played her last professional match at the 2003 French Open, but did not officially retire until February 2008.\n\nRegarded by many in the sport as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Seles was named one of the \"30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future\" by \"Time\". Several players and historians have stated that Seles had the potential to become the most accomplished female player of all time had she not been stabbed. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nSeles was born in Yugoslavia into an ethnic Hungarian family. Her parents are Ester and Karolj and she has an older brother, Zoltán. She began playing tennis at age five, coached by her father, a professional cartoonist employed for decades at the \"Dnevnik\" and \"Magyar Szó\" newspapers, who drew pictures for her to make her tennis more fun. He is responsible for developing her two-handed style for both the forehand and backhand. Later, her coach was Jelena Genčić. In 1985, at the age of 11, she won the Junior Orange Bowl tournament in Miami, Florida, catching the attention of tennis coach Nick Bollettieri. In early 1986, Seles and her brother Zoltán moved from Yugoslavia to the United States, and Seles enrolled at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy, where she trained for two years and continued to practice until March 1990. Nine months after their arrival at the Academy, Seles' mother and father joined her and Zoltán in Florida.\n\nSeles played her first professional tournament as an amateur in 1988 at age 14. The following year she turned professional on February 13, 1989, and joined the professional tour full-time, winning her first career title at Houston in May 1989, where she beat the soon-to-retire Chris Evert in the final. A month later, Seles reached the semifinals of her first Grand Slam singles tournament at the French Open, losing to then-world no. 1 Steffi Graf. Seles finished her first year on the tour ranked world no. 6.\n\nAfter a slow start at the beginning of the season, Seles went on a 36-match winning streak and won 6 consecutive tournaments starting in Miami at the Lipton Player's Championships. During that winning streak she also won the U.S. Hard Court Championships (San Antonio, Texas), the Eckerd Open (Tampa, Florida), the Italian Open, and the Lufthansa Cup in Berlin, Germany (defeating Steffi Graf in the final in straight sets). Seles then won her first Grand Slam singles title at the 1990 French Open. Facing world no. 1 Steffi Graf in the final, Seles saved four set points in a first-set tiebreaker, which she won 8–6, and went on to take the match in straight sets. In doing so, she became the youngest-ever French Open singles Champion at the age of 16 years, 6 months. Her winning streak was stopped by Zina Garrison at Wimbledon in the quarterfinals, where Seles had a match point before Garrison eventually won 9–7 in the 3rd set. Seles then won the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles title against Martina Navratilova and then defeated Navratilova again in winning the Oakland California tournament, in straight sets. She also won the 1990 year-end Virginia Slims Championships, defeating Gabriela Sabatini in five sets (in the first five-set women's match since 1901 US National Championships), becoming the youngest to ever win the Season-Ending Championships. She finished the year ranked world no. 2.\n\n1991 was the first of two years in which Seles dominated the women's tour. She started out by winning the Australian Open in January, beating Jana Novotná in the final. In March, she replaced Graf as the world no. 1. She then successfully defended her French Open title, beating the former youngest-ever winner, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, in the final. Unable to play at Wimbledon, suffering from shin splints, Seles took a six-week break. But she was back in time for the US Open, which she won by beating Martina Navratilova in the final, her third Grand Slam title of the year, to cement her position at the top of the world rankings. She also won the year-end Virginia Slims Championships for the second consecutive time, defeating Navratilova in four sets. At the end of season, Seles had won 10 out of the 16 tournaments she entered (reaching the final of every tournament that she entered that year). She ended the year as the no. 1 ranked player in the world.\n\n1992 was an equally dominant year. Seles successfully defended her titles at the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. She also reached her first-ever final at Wimbledon, but lost to Graf. During Wimbledon, Seles encountered difficulty because of her habit of grunting or shrieking loudly when hitting shots. Her quarterfinal opponent Nathalie Tauziat was the first to complain to the chair umpire about it. During the third set of her semi-final match against Martina Navratilova, Navratilova also complained to the chair umpire about the grunting after Seles went up a break at 4–2. Seles ended up losing the game and the break, but broke back and closed out the match.\n\nFrom January 1991 through February 1993, Seles won 22 titles and reached 33 finals out of the 34 tournaments she played. She compiled a 159–12 win-loss record (92.9% winning percentage), including a 55–1 win-loss record (98%) in Grand Slam tournaments. In the broader context of her first four years on the circuit (1989–1992), Seles had a win-loss record of 231–25 (90.2%) and collected 30 titles. She once again ended the year as the #1 ranked player in the world.\n\nSeles was the top ranked women's player heading into 1993, having won the French Open for three consecutive years and both the US Open and Australian Open in consecutive years. In January 1993, Seles defeated Graf in the final of the Australian Open, which to date was her third win in four Grand Slam finals against Graf. She then won the Virginia Slims of Chicago over Martina Navratilova in three sets. This was the last title that Seles won before the attack in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nOn April 30 during a quarterfinal match with Magdalena Maleeva in Hamburg in which Seles was leading, Günter Parche, an obsessed fan of Steffi Graf, ran from the middle of the crowd to the edge of the court during a break between games and stabbed Seles with a boning knife between her shoulder blades, to a depth of 1.5 cm (0.59 inches). She was quickly taken to a hospital. Although her physical injuries took only a few weeks to heal, she did not return to competitive tennis for more than two years. Initially, there was speculation that the attack might have been politically motivated because Seles was from Yugoslavia. She was known to have received death threats in relation to the ongoing conflict there. However, German authorities were quick to rule this out, describing her attacker as confused and possibly mentally disturbed.\n\nParche was charged following the incident, but was not jailed because he was found to be psychologically abnormal, and was instead sentenced to two years' probation and psychological treatment. The incident prompted a significant increase in the level of security at tour events. At that year's Wimbledon, the players’ seats were positioned with their backs to the umpire's chair, rather than the spectators. Seles, however, disputed the effectiveness of these measures. She was quoted in 2011 as saying \"From the time I was stabbed, I think the security hasn't changed\". Seles vowed never to play tennis in Germany again, disenchanted by the German legal system. \"What people seem to be forgetting is that this man stabbed me intentionally and he did not serve any sort of punishment for it... I would not feel comfortable going back. I don't foresee that happening.\" In a later article, \"Tennis.com\" reported that Parche was living in nursing homes due to additional health problems.\n\nGraf visited Seles while she was hospitalized. Young Elders, a band from Melbourne, Australia, sent their song called \"Fly Monica Fly\" to Seles while she was recuperating from the stabbing incident. She later said that the song provided inspiration to her at that time, and subsequently met the band (who later changed their name to the Monicas) following her victory at the Australian Open in 1996. The stabbing incident is the subject of Dan Bern's 1998 tribute to Seles, \"Monica\". Additionally, American band Majesty Crush paid tribute with \"Seles\" from the 1993 album \"Love-15\".\n\nThe WTA suggested that Seles' No. 1 ranking be preserved during her absence, but did not do so. According to Seles' autobiography, all active tour players opposed the idea except Gabriela Sabatini, who abstained. A vote was held at a tournament in Rome in 1993, and of 17 of the top players – Graf did not participate in the tournament and was thus absent – only Sabatini abstained.\n\nSeles returned to the tour in August 1995. In the runup to her comeback, then-WTA president Martina Navratilova proposed that Seles be reinstated alongside Steffi Graf as joint number one. The WTA did so despite some opposition from players including Arantxa Sánchez Vicario and Gigi Fernández, whose tournament placements would suffer greatly by suddenly being placed behind Seles. Graf supported Seles' co-ranking, but not the additional proposal that Seles' co-ranking not be determined by the minimum participation of 12 tournaments a year required of everyone else. Graf felt that would give Seles an unfair advantage in the rankings. Seles won her first comeback tournament, the Canadian Open, beating Amanda Coetzer in the final and setting a tournament record for the fewest number of games dropped by the champion throughout the tournament (14).\n\nThe following month at the US Open, Seles reached the final defeating world No.10 Anke Huber, No. 4 Jana Novotná, and No. 3 Conchita Martínez (all in straight sets), but lost to Graf in the final.\n\nIn January 1996, Seles won her fourth Australian Open, beating Anke Huber in the final. Her pivotal match was the semifinal vs rising American star Chanda Rubin who led her 5–3 in the final set, and had 2 break points to lead 5–1. Seles came back from 2 points from defeat to triumph and reach the final. This was to be Seles' last Grand Slam title, as she struggled to recapture her best form on a consistent basis. Seles was the runner-up at the US Open to Steffi Graf again in 1996. Seles' last Grand Slam final came at the French Open in 1998, just a few weeks after the death of her father and former coach, Karolj, from cancer. In the run to the final she had defeated world no. 3 Jana Novotná in three sets and world no. 1 Martina Hingis in straight sets, but lost to Sánchez Vicario in the three-set final.\n\nWhile she did not reach another Grand Slam singles final, she did consistently reach the quarterfinal and semifinal stages in those tournaments and was a fixture in the WTA Tour's top 10. In 2002, her last full year on the tour, she finished the year ranked world no. 7, defeated Venus Williams, Martina Hingis, Jennifer Capriati, Justine Henin, Maria Sharapova, Kim Clijsters, and Lindsay Davenport, and reached at least the quarterfinals at each Grand Slam tournament.\n\nSeles competed at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, where she beat Sabatini in a third round match before losing to Jana Novotná in the quarterfinals. Four years later, at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Seles captured her first Olympic medal, a bronze in singles. She defeated Jelena Dokic in the bronze medal match, after pushing eventual gold medalist Venus Williams to a tough 3 setter in the semis, losing 6–3 in the final set.\n\nAfter becoming a U.S. citizen in 1994, Seles helped the U.S. team win the Fed Cup in 1996, 1999, and 2000.\n\nIn the spring of 2003, Seles sustained a foot injury. She was forced to withdraw during the second set of a match against Nadia Petrova at the Italian Open. Then, a couple of weeks later and still injured, she lost in straight sets to the same player in the first round of the 2003 French Open. It was the only time she ever lost a first-round match at a Grand Slam. She never again played an official tour match.\n\nIn February 2005, Seles played two exhibition matches in New Zealand against Navratilova. Despite losing both matches, she played competitively and announced that she could return to the game early in 2006; however, she did not do so. She played three exhibition matches against Navratilova in 2007. On April 5, she defeated Navratilova in Houston, Texas, on clay. On September 14, Seles defeated Navratilova on an indoor court in New Orleans, Louisiana. On September 16, she beat her on clay in Bucharest.\n\nIn December 2007, Seles told the press that Lindsay Davenport's successful return to the tour had inspired her to consider her own limited comeback to play Grand Slam tournaments and the major warm-up events for those tournaments. However, on February 14, 2008, Seles announced her official retirement from professional tennis.\n\nIn January 2009, Seles was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nSeles is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. In 2012, Tennis Channel created a list of the 100 greatest tennis players. Seles was listed at #19.\n\nSeles won eight Grand Slam titles during her teenage years. However, her career was greatly affected by the stabbing incident. Some involved with the sport have declared that Seles could have become the most accomplished female player. In an article written 20 years after Seles was stabbed, Jonathan Scott of \"Tennis.com\" stated, \"Would Monica Seles have been the greatest female tennis player ever? The world will never know.\" In a 2013 interview, Martina Navratilova theorized that if Seles had not been stabbed, \"We'd be talking about Monica with the most Grand Slam titles [ahead of] Margaret Court or Steffi Graf.\" Mary Joe Fernandez declared that Seles would have at least doubled her Grand Slam championship tally, had she not been attacked. Tim Adams of \"The Guardian\" stated that Seles would have become \"the greatest female tennis player ever to pick up a racket.\"\n\nDuring the height of her career (the 1990 French Open through the 1993 Australian Open), she won eight of the 11 Grand Slam singles tournaments she contested. With eight Grand Slam singles titles before her 20th birthday, Seles holds the record for most Grand Slam singles titles won as a teenager in the Open Era.\n\nUntil her loss to Martina Hingis at the 1999 Australian Open, Seles had a perfect record at the event (33–0), which is the longest undefeated streak for this tournament (although Margaret Court won 38 consecutive matches there from 1960 to 1968 after losing a match in 1959). It also marked her first defeat in Australia, having won the Sydney tournament in 1996. Seles was the first female tennis player to win her first six Grand Slam singles finals: 1990 French Open, 1991 Australian Open, 1991 French Open, 1991 US Open, 1992 Australian Open, and 1992 French Open. Seles was also the first female player since Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling in 1937 to win the women's singles title three consecutive years at the French Open, a feat subsequently achieved by Justine Henin in 2005-7. (Also, Chris Evert won the title in four consecutive appearances in 1974, 1975, 1979, and 1980).\n\nShortly after her retirement, \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Jon Wertheim summed up her later career:\nShe was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame on July 11, 2009. In 2011, Seles was named one of the \"30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future\" by \"Time\".\n\nIn the early 1990s, Seles signed a $4-million endorsement contract with Fila to promote its footwear and tennis apparel. She used a Prince original graphite racquet on court. In August of the 1990 season, Seles switched to a Yonex racquet.\n\nWhen she returned to the tour in 1995 after the stabbing sabbatical, Seles wore apparel by Nike and used a Yonex racquet on court.\n\nIn the 2000s, Seles wore apparel by Yonex and used Yonex SRQ Ti-800 Pro Long racquet on court.\n\nOn April 21, 2009, Seles released her memoir \"Getting A Grip: On My Body, My Mind, My Self\" which chronicles her bout with depression and binge eating disorder (BED) after her stabbing, her father's cancer diagnosis and eventual death, her journey back to the game and a life beyond tennis.\n\nSeles is married to businessman Tom Golisano, who is 32 years her senior. They began dating in 2009. The two announced their engagement on June 5, 2014.\n\nAs of 2015, Seles is a paid spokesperson for Shire Pharmaceuticals, the makers of the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat BED, to raise awareness of the disorder she has suffered from since she was a young adult. Seles would eat normal amounts of food at meals, and then secretly eat large amounts of junk food when she was alone.\n\nIn 1996, Seles made a guest appearance in the TV sitcom \"The Nanny\". She also appeared in 2008 in the TV series \"Dancing with the Stars\" as one of the contestants.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Those affected often spend much time thinking about achieving power or success, or on their appearance. They often take advantage of the people around them. The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of social situations.\nThe cause of narcissistic personality disorder is unknown. It is a personality disorder classified within cluster B by the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM). Diagnosis is made by a healthcare professional interviewing the person in question. The condition needs to be differentiated from mania and substance use disorder.\nTreatments have not been well-studied. Therapy is often difficult as people with the disorder frequently do not consider themselves to have a problem. About one percent of people are believed to be affected at some point in their life. It appears to occur more often in males than females and affects young people more than older people. The personality was first described in 1925 by Robert Waelder, and the term NPD came into use in 1968.\n\nPeople with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) are characterized by persistent grandiosity, excessive need for admiration, and a personal disdain and lack of empathy for others. As such, the person with NPD usually displays arrogance and a distorted sense of superiority, and they seek to establish abusive power and control over others. Self-confidence (a strong sense of self) is different from narcissistic personality disorder; people with NPD typically value themselves over others to the extent that they openly disregard the feelings and wishes of others, and expect to be treated as superior, regardless of their actual status or achievements. Moreover, the person with narcissistic personality disorder usually exhibits a fragile ego (self-concept), intolerance of criticism, and a tendency to belittle others in order to validate their own superiority.\n\nThe DSM-5 indicates that persons with NPD usually display some or all of the following symptoms, typically without the commensurate qualities or accomplishments:\n\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder usually develops in adolescence or early adulthood. It is not uncommon for children and adolescents to display traits similar to those of NPD, but such occurrences are usually transient, and below the criteria for a diagnosis of NPD. True symptoms of NPD are pervasive, apparent in varied situations, and rigid, remaining consistent over time. The NPD symptoms must be sufficiently severe that they significantly impair the person's capabilities to develop meaningful human relationships. Generally, the symptoms of NPD also impair the person's psychological abilities to function, either at work, or school, or important social settings. The DSM-5 indicates that the traits manifested by the person must substantially differ from cultural norms, in order to qualify as symptoms of NPD.\n\nPeople with NPD tend to exaggerate their skills, accomplishments, and their level of intimacy with people they consider high-status. This sense of superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations or to become impatient or disdainful when others talk about themselves. When their own ego is wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation, but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated. Despite occasional flare-ups of insecurity, their self-image is primarily stable (i.e., overinflated).\n\nTo the extent that people are pathologically narcissistic, they can be controlling, blaming, self-absorbed, intolerant of others' views, unaware of others' needs and the effects of their behavior on others, and insist that others see them as they wish to be seen. Narcissistic individuals use various strategies to protect the self at the expense of others. They tend to devalue, derogate, insult, and blame others, and they often respond to threatening feedback with anger and hostility. Since the fragile ego of individuals with NPD is hypersensitive to perceived criticism or defeat, they are prone to feelings of shame, humiliation, and worthlessness over minor or even imagined incidents. They usually mask these feelings from others with feigned humility or by isolating themselves socially, or they may react with outbursts of rage, defiance, or by seeking revenge. The merging of the \"inflated self-concept\" and the \"actual self\" is seen in the inherent grandiosity of narcissistic personality disorder. Also inherent in this process are the defense mechanisms of denial, idealization and devaluation.\n\nAccording to the DSM-5: \"Many highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute narcissistic personality disorder.\" Due to the high-functionality associated with narcissism, some people may not view it as an impairment in their lives. Although overconfidence tends to make individuals with NPD ambitious, it does not necessarily lead to success and high achievement professionally. These individuals may be unwilling to compete or may refuse to take any risks in order to avoid appearing like a failure. In addition, their inability to tolerate setbacks, disagreements, or criticism, along with lack of empathy, make it difficult for such individuals to work cooperatively with others or to maintain long-term professional relationships with superiors and colleagues.\n\nThe causes of narcissistic personality disorder are unknown. Experts tend to apply a biopsychosocial model of causation, meaning that a combination of environmental, social, genetic and neurobiological factors are likely to play a role in formulating a narcissistic personality.\n\nThere is evidence that narcissistic personality disorder is heritable, and individuals are much more likely to develop NPD if they have a family history of the disorder. Studies on the occurrence of personality disorders in twins determined that there is a moderate to high heritability for narcissistic personality disorder.\n\nHowever, the specific genes and gene interactions that contribute to its cause—and how they may influence the developmental and physiological processes underlying this condition—have yet to be determined.\n\nEnvironmental and social factors are also thought to have a significant influence on the onset of NPD. In some people, pathological narcissism may develop from an impaired attachment to their primary caregivers, usually their parents. This can result in the child's perception of himself/herself as unimportant and unconnected to others. The child typically comes to believe they have some personality defect that makes them unvalued and unwanted. Overindulgent, permissive parenting as well as insensitive, over-controlling parenting, are believed to be contributing factors.\n\nAccording to Leonard Groopman and Arnold Cooper, the following have been identified by various researchers as possible factors that promote the development of NPD:\n\nCultural elements are believed to influence the prevalence of NPD as well since NPD traits have been found to be more common in modern societies than in traditional ones.\n\nThere is little research into the neurological underpinnings of narcissistic personality disorder. However, recent research has identified a structural abnormality in the brains of those with narcissistic personality disorder, specifically noting less volume of gray matter in the left anterior insula. Another study has associated the condition with reduced gray matter in the prefrontal cortex.\n\nThe brain regions identified in the above studies are associated with empathy, compassion, emotional regulation, and cognitive functioning. These findings suggest that narcissistic personality disorder is related to a compromised capacity for emotional empathy and emotional regulation.\n\nThe formulation of narcissistic personality disorder in the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\", 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) was criticised for failing to describe the range and complexity of the disorder. Critics said it focuses overly on \"the narcissistic individual's external, symptomatic, or social interpersonal patterns—at the expense of ... internal complexity and individual suffering\", which they argued reduced its clinical utility.\n\nThe Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group originally proposed the elimination of NPD as a distinct disorder in DSM-5 as part of a major revamping of the diagnostic criteria for personality disorders, replacing a categorical with a dimensional approach based on the severity of dysfunctional personality trait domains. Some clinicians objected to this, characterizing the new diagnostic system as an \"unwieldy conglomeration of disparate models that cannot happily coexist\" and may have limited usefulness in clinical practice. The general move towards a dimensional (personality trait-based) view of the Personality Disorders has been maintained despite the reintroduction of NPD.\n\nThe World Health Organization's (WHO) \"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems\", 10th Edition (ICD-10) lists narcissistic personality disorder under \"Other specific personality disorders\". It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of general personality disorder criteria.\n\nWhile the DSM-5 regards narcissistic personality disorder as a homogeneous syndrome, there is evidence for variations in its expression. In a 2015 paper, two major presentations of narcissism are typically suggested, an \"overt\" or \"grandiose\" subtype, characterized by grandiosity, arrogance, and boldness, and a \"covert\" or \"vulnerable\" subtype characterized by defensiveness and hypersensitivity. Those with \"narcissistic grandiosity\" express behavior \"through interpersonally exploitative acts, lack of empathy, intense envy, aggression, and exhibitionism.\" Psychiatrist Glen Gabbard described the subtype, which he referred to as the \"oblivious\" subtype as being grandiose, arrogant, and thick-skinned. The subtype of \"narcissistic vulnerability\" entails (on a conscious level) \"helplessness, emptiness, low self-esteem, and shame, which can be expressed in the behavior as being socially avoidant in situations where their self-presentation is not possible so they withdraw, or the approval they need/expect is not being met.\" Gabbard described this subtype, which he referred to as the \"hypervigilant\" subtype as being easily hurt, oversensitive, and ashamed. In addition, a \"high-functioning\" presentation, where there is less impairment in the areas of life where those with a more severe expression of the disorder typically have difficulties in, is suggested.\n\nTheodore Millon suggested five subtypes of narcissism. However, there are few pure variants of any subtype, and the subtypes are not recognized in the DSM or ICD.\n\nPossible additional categories not cited by the current theory of Millon might include:\n\nWill Titshaw also suggested three subtypes of narcissistic personality disorder which are not officially recognized in any editions of the DSM or the ICD.\n\nNPD has a high rate of comorbidity with other mental disorders. Individuals with NPD are prone to bouts of depression, often meeting criteria for co-occurring depressive disorders. In addition, NPD is associated with bipolar disorder, anorexia, and substance use disorders, especially cocaine. As far as other personality disorders, NPD may be associated with histrionic, borderline, antisocial, and paranoid personality disorders.\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder is rarely the primary reason for people seeking mental health treatment. When people with NPD enter treatment, it is typically prompted by life difficulties or to seek relief from another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, substance use disorders, bipolar disorder, or eating disorders, or at the insistence of relatives and friends. This is partly because individuals with NPD generally have poor insight and fail to recognize their perception and behavior as inappropriate and problematic due to their very positive self-image.\n\nTreatment for NPD is centered around psychotherapy. In the 1960s, Heinz Kohut and Otto Kernberg challenged the conventional wisdom of the time by outlining clinical strategies for using psychoanalytic psychotherapy with clients with NPD that they claimed were effective in treating the disorder. Contemporary treatment modalities commonly involve transference-focused, metacognitive, and schema-focused therapies. Some improvement might be observed through the treatment of symptoms related to comorbid disorders with psychopharmaceuticals, but , according to Elsa Ronningstam, psychologist at Harvard Medical School, \"Alliance building and engaging the patient's sense of agency and reflective ability are essential for change in pathological narcissism.\"\n\nPattern change strategies performed over a long period of time are used to increase the ability of those with NPD to become more empathic in everyday relationships. To help modify their sense of entitlement and self-centeredness schema, the strategy is to help them identify how to utilize their unique talents and to help others for reasons other than their own personal gain. This is not so much to change their self-perception of their \"entitlement\" feeling but more to help them empathize with others. Another type of treatment would be temperament change. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy may be effective in treating NPD, but therapists must recognize the patient's traits and use caution in tearing down narcissistic defenses too quickly. Anger, rage, impulsivity, and impatience can be worked on with skill training. Therapy may not be effective because patients may receive feedback poorly and defensively. Anxiety disorders and somatoform disorders are prevalent, but the most common would be depression.\n\nGroup treatment has its benefits, as the effectiveness of receiving peer feedback rather than the clinician's may be more accepted, but group therapy can also contradict itself as the patient may show \"demandingness, egocentrism, social isolation and withdrawal, and socially deviant behavior\". Researchers originally thought group therapy among patients with NPD would fail because it was believed that group therapy required empathy that NPD patients lack. However, studies show group therapy does hold value for patients with NPD because it lets them explore boundaries, develop trust, increase self-awareness, and accept feedback. Relationship therapy stresses the importance of learning and applying four basic interpersonal skills: \"...effective expression, empathy, discussion and problem solving/conflict resolution\". Marital/relationship therapy is most beneficial when both partners participate.\n\nNo medications are indicated for treating NPD, but may be used to treat co-occurring mental conditions or symptoms that may be associated with it such as depression, anxiety, and impulsiveness if present.\n\nThe effectiveness of psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions in the treatment of narcissistic personality disorder has yet to be systematically and empirically investigated. Clinical practice guidelines for the disorder have not yet been created, and current treatment recommendations are largely based on theoretical psychodynamic models of NPD and the experiences of clinicians with afflicted individuals in clinical settings.\n\nThe presence of NPD in patients undergoing psychotherapy for the treatment of other mental disorders is associated with slower treatment progress and higher dropout rates.\n\nLifetime prevalence of NPD is estimated at 1% in the general population and 2% to 16% in clinical populations. A 2010 systematic review found the prevalence of NPD to be between 0% to 6% in community samples. There is a small gender difference, with men having a slightly higher incidence than in women.\n\nAccording to a 2015 meta-analysis that looked at gender differences in NPD, there has recently been a debate about a perceived increase in the prevalence of NPD among younger generations and among women. However, the authors found that this was not reflected in the data and that the prevalence has remained relatively stable for both genders over the last 30 years (when data on the disorder were first collected).\n\nThe use of the term \"narcissism\" to describe excessive vanity and self-centeredness predates by many years the modern medical classification of narcissistic personality disorder. The condition was named after Narcissus, a mythological Greek youth who became infatuated with his own reflection in a lake. He did not realize at first that it was his own reflection, but when he did, he died out of grief for having fallen in love with someone that did not exist outside himself.\n\nThe term \"narcissistic personality structure\" was introduced by Kernberg in 1967 and \"narcissistic personality disorder\" first proposed by Heinz Kohut in 1968.\n\nSigmund Freud commented, regarding the adult neurotic's sense of omnipotence, \"this belief is a frank acknowledgement of a relic of the old megalomania of infancy\". He similarly concluded: \"we can detect an element of megalomania in most other forms of paranoic disorder. We are justified in assuming that this megalomania is essentially of an infantile nature and that, as development proceeds, it is sacrificed to social considerations\".\n\nEdmund Bergler also considered megalomania to be normal in the child, and for it to be reactivated in later life in gambling. Otto Fenichel states that, for those who react in later life to narcissistic hurt with denial, a similar regression to the megalomania of childhood is taking place.\n\nWhereas Freud saw megalomania as an obstacle to psychoanalysis, in the second half of the 20th century, object relations theory, both in the United States and among British Kleinians, set about revaluing megalomania as a defence mechanism that offered potential access for therapy. Such an approach built on Heinz Kohut's view of narcissistic megalomania as an aspect of normal development, by contrast with Kernberg's consideration of such grandiosity as a pathological development distortion.\n\nIn popular culture, narcissistic personality disorder has been called megalomania.\n\nAn article on the Victorian Web argues that Rosamond Vincy, in George Eliot's \"Middlemarch\" (1871–72), is a full-blown narcissist as defined by the DSM.\n\nIn the film \"To Die For\", Nicole Kidman's character wants to appear on television at all costs, even if this involves murdering her husband. A psychiatric assessment of her character noted: \"[she] was seen as a prototypical narcissistic person by the raters: on average, she satisfied 8 of 9 criteria for narcissistic personality disorder... had she been evaluated for personality disorders, she would receive a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder\".\n\nOther examples in popular fiction include television characters Adam Demamp (portrayed by Adam DeVine in \"Workaholics\") and Dennis Reynolds (portrayed by Glenn Howerton in \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\").\n\nA Norwegian study concluded that narcissism should be conceived as personality dimensions pertinent to the whole range of PDs rather than as a distinct diagnostic category. Alarcón and Sarabia, in examining past literature on the disorder, concluded that narcissistic personality disorder \"shows nosological inconsistency and that its consideration as a trait domain with needed further research would be strongly beneficial to the field\".\n\n\n"}

This institute is located at Hyderabad near Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL). Being the only major balloon facility in the world close to the geomagnetic equator, this facility is extensively used by researchers from all over the world.\n\nBallooning activity in India was prompted by research into atmospheric exploration and cosmic ray studies. During the 1940s, Dr. Homi J. Bhabha of TIFR started sending balloons up to an altitude of 25 km to study secondary cosmic radiation. Due to unique geographic reasons Hyderabad was selected for stratospheric balloon launches. After various diplomatic meetings arrangements were made by US and Indian organisations to jointly launch balloons from Hyderabad. The first launch had support of Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory (AFCRL) and TIFR.\n\nThe launches were carried out from two locations. US balloons were launched from Begumpet Airport and Indian balloons from Osmania University Campus. The first balloon was launched on 2 February 1961. During the first stage of the facility's operation, forty balloons were launched.\n\nAfter five years all the facilities were consolidated at Osmania University and under management of National Center for Atmospheric Research & TIFR and around 170 balloons were launched.\n\nAfter a few years with increasing demands for balloon flights, a relatively low population density and proximity to the geomagnetic equator, a permanent site at Hyderabad near ECIL was selected. However, presently due to rapid development this facility is today surrounded by several population settlements: by the Cherlapally Central Jail in the east; Kamala Nagar in the west; and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd. in the south.\n\nThe campus contains a complete balloon manufacturing facility. The institute conducts balloon-based scientific experiments in X-ray and Infrared Astronomy, and in Aeronomy.\nBalloons from this facility are launched twice in a year, i.e. in summer and winter. NBF also regularly monitors and analyses local weather at tropospheric and stratospheric altitudes, required for making decisions about balloon launches.\n\nUnder the High Altitude Balloon Development Project, a 61,000m³ indigenously developed balloon penetrated into the Mesosphere on 7 January 2014, for the first time in India. Until that time, only balloons from USA and Japan had accomplished this feat.\n\n"}

It includes behaviors such as repeated calls and texts, malicious contact, spreading rumors, stalking, and violence (kidnapping and assault).\n\nDrs. Brian Spitzberg and William Cupach, the creators of the term, define ORI as \"repeated and unwanted pursuit and invasion of one's sense of physical or symbolic privacy by another person, either stranger or acquaintance, who desires and/or presumes an intimate relationship\". Some victims of ORI have no preexisting relationship with or interest in their pursuers; others know their pursuers, but are less interested in making an existing relationship more intimate.\n\nThere are several key components of ORI that distinguish it from other similar relational patterns.\n\nFirst, ORI involves a lack of mutual agreement regarding the nature or even the existence of a relationship. While the person obsessed with the relationship is attempting to make a closer connection, the object of ORI desires freedom from continued forced contact. Spitzberg writes that \"this dialectical tension is endemic to the formation and ongoing construction of all interpersonal relationships\".\n\nSecond, ORI is not associated with a singular event, but is repeated. Spitzberg and Cupach write, \"Obsessiveness is reflected in the fact that the intruder is fixated on the target of attention; the intruder's thoughts and behaviors are persistent, preoccupying, and often morbid. Pursuit is persistent despite the absence of reciprocity by the obsessional object and despite resistance by the object.\" The episodes of unwanted behavior tend to escalate over time, with the seriousness rising and the time between incidents shortening.\n\nThird, the intrusion can be symbolic and psychological, not just physical. The invasion of privacy as well as the imposition on the victim's feelings of freedom of choice are important aspects of ORI.\n\nStudies have been done to explore certain factors that predispose individuals to ORI. Some have found narcissism and low empathy as predictors for ORI, and hypothesized that people with high empathy would be more inclined to judge ORI behaviors as unacceptable. But this pattern has been found inconclusive; one study found that empathy may not inhibit ORI, although there is a substantial positive relationship between narcissism and the acceptability of ORI.\n\nMany victims of ORI have also experienced sexual coercion, and the coping responses used for both tend to be similar. Additionally, the more serious the intrusion (for example, violence), the more formal the coping response (for example, calling the police).\n\nORI behavior, as well as non-ORI sexually coercive behavior, can involve types of coercion identified as deception coercion, mild force coercion, psychological coercion and severe force coercion.\n\nStalking, a severe form of ORI, is typically defined as \"the willful, malicious, and repeated following and harassing of another persons that threatens his or her safety\".\n\nSpitzberg and Cupach state more research is needed to correctly capture the connection, but ORI and stalking are pervasive and impactful occurrences. A clearer picture is needed to better understand the incidence, prevalence and consequences of ORI and stalking. Better understanding will provide improvements in prevention, intervention and treatment of offenders and victims.\n\nThe authors Brian Spitzberg and William Cupach developed ORI in 1998, and published their research in their book \"The Dark Side of Close Relationships.\"\n\nAccording to the Relational Goal Pursuit Theory (RGPT), people expend energy to develop or reinitiate relationships to the extent that they perceive a relationship desirable and attainable. It becomes all about achieving the goal of a relationship. ORI occurs when people continue to believe that a relationship is attainable even though it is not. The pursuer begins to escalate when they meet challenges to their goal. \nRGPT identifies processes that conspire to transform otherwise normal relationships into ORI and stalking. All relationships begin with a goal to pursuit. The following are some rules:\n\n\nCultural scripts – if people play hard to get enough, eventually win the affection of person trying to love – usually work against the realization that the relationship is unattainable.\n\nAmbiguous communication – initiation, reinitiating and rejection of relationships may keep hope alive. Using indirect signals to reject people because they are worried about hurting their feelings, pursuers usually interpret this incorrectly.\n\nRumination – when people can’t obtain a goal, they tend to fixate on the problem and pursuers redouble their efforts.\n\nShift in motivation – when pursuer moves from desire to revenge from a feeling of being humiliated. This shift usually marks the beginning of more aggressive behaviors.\n\nWith the increase of Facebook and other social media tools designed to make us more accessible to others while taking away pieces of our privacy, ORI has become easier in an online world. There is relational intrusion from both offenders and targets in five different categories:\n\n\nOnline social media helps to facilitate behaviors indicative of ORI and these behaviors have consequences for users on their privacy and security.\n"}

It is used as an alternative to a traditional organizational chart as it does not imply the same degree of linear hierarchy that an organizational chart does.\n\nOrganigraphs are used to expose critical associations and competitive opportunities as opposed to viewing all parties, departments, and business units as separate entities. They also can reveal relationships between departments, products, supply chains, and more within an organization that might not otherwise be apparent. Business strategists, consultants, and academics use organigraphs.\n\nThe organigraph was conceived by Henry Mintzberg and Ludo Van der Heyden.\n\nOrganigraphs can be created as diagrams or as images which represent the nature of the firm. For example, a computer company's organigraph could be in the form of a computer. The hard drive could represent employees, the power supply could relate to its financing, and the web browser could indicate the firm's strategy.\n\n"}
{"id": "4723495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4723495", "title": "Outcome bias", "text": "Outcome bias\n\nThe outcome bias is an error made in evaluating the quality of a decision when the outcome of that decision is already known. Specifically, the outcome effect occurs when the same \"behavior produce[s] more ethical condemnation when it happen[s] to produce bad rather than good outcome, even if the outcome is determined by chance.\"\n\nWhile similar to the hindsight bias, the two phenomena are markedly different. The hindsight bias focuses on memory distortion to favor the actor, while the outcome bias focuses exclusively on weighting the past outcome heavier than other pieces of information in deciding if a past decision was correct.\n\nOne will often judge a past decision by its ultimate outcome instead of based on the quality of the decision at the time it was made, given what was known at that time. This is an error because no decision maker ever knows whether or not a calculated risk will turn out for the best. The actual outcome of the decision will often be determined by chance, with some risks working out and others not. Individuals whose judgments are influenced by outcome bias are seemingly holding decision makers responsible for events beyond their control.\n\nBaron and Hershey (1988) presented subjects with hypothetical situations in order to test this.\nOne such example involved a surgeon deciding whether or not to do a risky surgery on a patient. The surgery had a known probability of success. Subjects were presented with either a good or bad outcome (in this case living or dying), and asked to rate the quality of the surgeon's pre-operation decision. Those presented with bad outcomes rated the decision worse than those who had good outcomes. \"The ends justify the means\" is an often used aphorism to express the Outcome effect when the outcome is desirable.\n\nThe reason why an individual makes this mistake is that he or she will incorporate presently available information when evaluating a past decision. To avoid the influence of outcome bias, one should evaluate a decision by ignoring information collected after the fact and focusing on what the right answer is, or was at the time the decision was made.\n\n"}

The items having been \"pawned\" to the broker are themselves called \"pledges\" or \"pawns\", or simply the collateral. While many items can be pawned, pawnshops typically accept jewelry, musical instruments, home audio equipment, computers, video game systems, televisions, cameras, power tools, firearms, and other relatively valuable items as collateral.\n\nIf an item is pawned for a loan (colloquially \"hocked\" or \"popped\"), within a certain contractual period of time the pawner may redeem it for the amount of the loan plus some agreed-upon amount for interest. The amount of time, and rate of interest, is governed by law and by the pawnbroker's policies. If the loan is not paid (or extended, if applicable) within the time period, the pawned item will be offered for sale to other customers by the pawnbroker. Unlike other lenders, the pawnbroker does not report the defaulted loan on the customer's credit report, since the pawnbroker has physical possession of the item and may recoup the loan value through outright sale of the item. The pawnbroker also sells items that have been sold outright to them by customers. Some pawnshops are willing to trade items in their shop for items brought to them by customers.\n\nThe pawning process begins when a customer brings an item into a pawn shop. Common items pawned (or, in some instances, sold outright) by customers include jewelry, electronics, collectibles, musical instruments, tools, and (depending on local regulations) firearms. Gold, silver, and platinum are popular items—which are often purchased, even if in the form of broken jewelry of little value. Metal can still be sold in bulk to a bullion dealer or smelter for the value by weight of the component metals. Similarly, jewelry that contains genuine gemstones, even if broken or missing pieces, have value.\n\nThe pawnbroker assumes the risk that an item might have been stolen. However, laws in many jurisdictions protect both the community and broker from \"unknowingly\" handling stolen goods (also known as \"fencing\"). These laws often require that the pawnbroker establish positive identification of the seller through photo identification (such as a driver's license or government-issued identity document), as well as a holding period placed on an item purchased by a pawnbroker (to allow time for local law enforcement authorities to track stolen items). In some jurisdictions, pawnshops must give a list of all newly pawned items and any associated serial number to police, so the police can determine if any of the items have been reported stolen. Many police departments advise burglary or robbery victims to visit local pawnshops to see if they can locate stolen items. Some pawnshops set up their own screening criteria to avoid buying stolen property.\n\nThe pawnbroker assesses an item for its condition and marketability by testing the item and examining it for flaws, scratches or other damage. Another aspect that affects marketability is the supply and demand for the item in the community or region. In some markets, the used goods market is so flooded with used stereos and car stereos, for example, that pawnshops will only accept the higher-quality brand names. Alternatively, a customer may offer to pawn an item that is difficult to sell, such as a surfboard in an inland region, or a pair of snowshoes in warm-winter regions. The pawnshop owner either turns down hard-to-sell items, or offers a low price. While some items never get outdated, such as hammers and hand saws, electronics and computer items quickly become obsolete and unsaleable. Pawnshop owners must learn about different makes and models of computers, software, and other electronic equipment, so they can value objects accurately.\n\nTo assess value of different items, pawnbrokers use guidebooks (\"blue books\"), catalogs, Internet search engines, and their own experience. Some pawnbrokers have trained in identification of gems, or employ a specialist to assess jewelry. One of the risks of accepting secondhand goods is that the item may be counterfeit. If the item is counterfeit, such as a fake Rolex watch, it may have only a fraction of the value of the genuine item. Once the pawnbroker determines the item is genuine and not likely stolen, and that it is marketable, the pawnbroker offers the customer an amount for it. The customer can either sell the item outright if (as in most cases) the pawnbroker is also a licensed secondhand dealer, or offer the item as collateral on a loan. Most pawnshops are willing to negotiate the amount of the loan with the client.\n\nTo determine the amount of the loan, the pawnshop owner needs to take into account several factors. A key factor is the predicted resale value of the item. This is often thought of in terms of a range, with the low point being the wholesale value of the used good, in the case that the pawnshop is unable to sell it to pawnshop customers, and they decide to sell it to a wholesale merchant of used goods. The higher point in the range is the retail sale price in the pawnshop. For example, a five-year-old laptop may have been bought by the customer for $1000. However, as a used item in a pawnshop, it might only fetch $250 as a purchase price in the pawnshop, because the customers will be wary that it might be a \"lemon\" that the seller is getting rid of because it has some hard-to-detect problem, and because pawnshops do not typically offer a warranty with goods sold. Used electronics wholesalers will buy the laptop from the pawnshop owner for $100 to $150. The wholesaler pays a lower price than the retail value because they have the added cost of hiring electronics technicians who overhaul and repair the items so that they can be sold in used electronics stores.\n\nThe pawnshop owner also takes into account their knowledge of supply and demand for the item in question to determine if they think that they will end up selling the laptop for $100 to a wholesaler or $250 to a pawnshop customer. If the pawnshop owner believes that the local market for used laptops is saturated (overloaded with used laptops), they may fear that they will only get $100 for the laptop if they have to unload it to a wholesaler. With that figure in mind as the expected revenue, the pawnshop owner has to factor in the overhead costs of the store (rent, heat, electricity, phone connection, yellow pages advertisement, website costs, staff costs, insurance, alarm system, items lost when they are confiscated by police, etc.), and a profit for the business. As such, the customer who comes in with this laptop that they paid $1000 for when it was new may be offered as little as $50 by the pawnshop owner, who is taking into account all of the risk and cost factors.\n\nIn determining the amount of the loan, the pawnshop owner also assesses the likelihood that the customer will pay the interest for several weeks or months and then return to repay the loan and reclaim the item. Since the key to the pawnshop business model is making interest off the loaned money, pawnshop owners want to accept items that the customer is likely to want to recover, after having paid interest for a period on the loan. If, in an extreme case, a pawnshop only accepted items that customers had no interest in ever reclaiming, it would not make any money from interest, and the store would in effect become a second hand dealer. Determining if the customer is likely to return to reclaim an item is a subjective decision, and the pawnshop owner may take many factors into account. For example, if a young able-bodied man comes into the pawnshop to pawn an electric wheelchair (perhaps claiming it to be the possession of his late grandparent), the pawnshop owner may doubt that the item will be redeemed. On the other hand, if a middle aged man pawns a top quality set of golf clubs, the pawnshop owner may assess it as more credible that he will return for the items. Some customers may attempt to persuade the pawnshop owner that the item in question is important to them (\"that necklace belonged to my grandmother, so I will certainly return for it\") as a means of obtaining a loan. Other customers return to the same store, repeatedly pawn the same item(s) as a way of borrowing money, and return to pay the interest and recover the item(s) before the end of the loan period; thus, the pawnbroker knows that redemption is likely and will therefore make the loan.\n\nThe saleability of the item and the amount that the customer wants for it are also factored into the pawnbroker's assessment; if a customer offers a very salable item at a low price, the pawnbroker may accept it even if it is unlikely that the customer will return, because the pawnshop can turn around a quick profit on the item. However, if a customer offers an extremely low price the pawnbroker may turn down the offer, because this suggests that the item may either be counterfeit or stolen.\n\nIn some countries e.g. Sweden there is legislation to prevent the pawn broker from making unfair profits (usury due to financial distress or ignorance of the customer) at the expense of the customer by low evaluation on their collaterals. It is stated that the pawn broker may not keep the collateral but must sell them at public auction. Any excess after paying the loan, the interest and auction costs must be paid to the customer. If the item does not fetch a price that will cover these expenses the pawn broker may keep the item and sell it through other channels. Despite this protection, the cost for the customer to borrow money this way will be high, and if he cannot redeem the collateral it would in many cases be better to sell the goods directly.\n\nPawnshops have to be careful to manage how many new items they accept as pawns: either too little inventory or too much is bad. A pawnshop might have too little inventory if, for example, it mostly buys jewels and gold that it resells or smelts—or perhaps the pawnshop owner quickly sells most items through specialty shops (e.g., musical instruments to music stores, stereos to used hi-fi audio stores, etc.). In this case, the pawnshop is less interesting to customers, because it is mostly empty.\n\nOn the other extreme, a pawnshop with a huge inventory has several disadvantages. If the store is crammed with used athletic gear, old stereos, and old tools, the store owner must spend time and money shelving and sorting items, displaying them on different stands or in glass cases, and monitoring customers to prevent shoplifting. If there are too many low-value, poor quality items, such as old toasters, scratched-up 20-year-old TVs, and worn-out sports gear piled into cardboard boxes, the store may begin to look more like a rummage sale or flea market. Small, high-value items such as iPod players or cell phones must be in locked glass display cases, which means the owner may need additional staff to unlock the cabinets for items customers want to examine. As a store fills with items, an owner must protect inventory theft by hiring staff to supervise the different areas or install security cameras and alarms. Too much unsold inventory means that the store has not been able to realize value from these items to provide cash to lend.\n\nThe better option lies in the middle: a store with a moderate amount of good quality, brand-name items arranged neatly in the display windows attracts passersby, who are more likely to enter and shop. If items are attractively laid out in display cases and shelves, the pawnshop looks more professional and reputable. Once passersby start shopping in the store, they may be more inclined to pawn or sell their own items to the pawnshop. Some pawnshop owners prevent cluttered look by storing overstocked items, or less attractive items such as snow tires, in a back room or basement. Some pawnshop companies operate a chain of stores in a state or province. This way, they can balance inventory between stores. For example, they can move some of a rural store's surfeit of fishing gear to an urban store.\n\nSome stores also slim down inventory by selling items to specialty retailers. A pawnshop in a low-income neighborhood that pays a customer $300 for a power amplifier with a used value of $2000 may find the unit hard to sell alongside much less expensive merchandise. They may sell the amplifier to a used audio equipment store whose customers expect higher end equipment. Some pawnshops sell specialty items online, on eBay or other websites. A specialty item such as a high-end model railroad set may not sell in the store for its \"blue book\" value. On an online auction, it stands a good chance of bringing a good price.\n\nAnother growing trend in the industry is vehicle pawn or auto pawning. This form of Pawnbroking works like a traditional pawn loan, however these stores only accept vehicles as security. Many stores are also accepting \"Title Loans\", where you can pawn the ownership or \"Title\" documents of your vehicle. This essentially means that the pawnbroker owns your car while you drive it, and you regain ownership once you pay back your loan. \n\nWhile the main business activities of a pawnshop are lending money for interest based on valuable items that customers bring in, some pawnshops also undertake other business activities, such as selling brand-new retail items that are in demand in the neighborhood of the store. Depending on where a pawnshop is located, these other retail items may range from musical instruments to firearms. Some pawnbrokers also sell brand-new self-defense items such as pepper spray or stun guns.\n\nMany pawnshops will also trade used items, as long as the transaction turns a profit for pawn shop. In cases where the pawnshop buys items outright, the money is not a loan; it is a straight payment for the item. On sales, the pawnshop may offer layaway plans, subject to conditions (down payment, regular payments, and forfeiture of previously paid amounts if the item is not paid off).\n\nSome pawnshops may keep a few unusual, high value items on display to capture the interests of passersby, such as a vintage Harley Davidson motorcycle; the owner is not typically expecting to sell these items. Other activities carried out by pawnshops are financial services including fee-based check cashing, payday loans, vehicle title or house title loans, and currency exchange services.\n\nUpscale pawnshops began to appear in the early 20th century, often referred to as \"loan offices\", since the term “pawn shop” had a very negative historical reputation at this point. Some of these so-called loan offices are even located in the upper floors of office buildings. The modern euphemism for the upscale pawn shop is the \"high-end collateral lender\", lending to upper-class often white-collar individuals, including doctors, lawyers and bankers, as well as more colorful individuals like high-rolling gamblers. They are also interchangeably called \"upscale pawnshops\" and \"high-end pawnshops\" due to their acceptance of higher value merchandise in exchange for short-term loans. These objects can include wine collections, jewelry, large diamonds, fine art, cars, and unique memorabilia. Loans are often sought to deal with business revenue shortfalls and other expensive fiscal issues. Upscale pawnshops have also been featured in reality television.\n\nIn the US, there are over 11,000 pawnbrokers and an industry revenue of $14.5 billion. The US industry serves 30 million customers.\n\nIn the west, pawnbroking existed in the Ancient Greek and Roman Empires. Most contemporary Western law on the subject is derived from the Roman jurisprudence. As the empire spread its culture, pawnbroking went with it. Likewise, in the East, the business model existed in China 1500 years ago in Buddhist monasteries no different from today, through the ages strictly regulated by Imperial or other authorities.\n\nIn spite of early Roman Catholic Church prohibitions against charging interest on loans, there is some evidence that the Franciscans were permitted to begin the practice as an aid to the poor. Pawn brokerage arrived in England with William the Conqueror. In 1338, Edward III pawned his jewels to raise money for his war with France. King Henry V did much the same in 1415. The Lombards were not a popular class, and Henry VII harried them a good deal. In 1603 an \"Act against Brokers\" was passed and remained on the statute-book until 1872. It was aimed at the many counterfeit brokers in London. This type of broker was evidently regarded as a fence.\nCrusaders, predominantly in France, brokered their land holdings to monasteries and diocese for funds to supply, outfit, and transport their armies to the Holy Land. Instead of outright repayment the Church reaped a certain amount of crop returns for a certain amount of seasons, which could additionally be re-exchanged in a type of equity.\n\nA pawnbroker can also be a charity. In 1450, Barnaba Manassei, a Franciscan monk, began the Monte di Pietà movement in Perugia, Italy. It provided financial assistance in the form of no-interest loans secured with pawned items. Instead of interest, the Monte di Pietà urged borrowers to make donations to the Church. It spread through Italy, then to other parts of Europe. The first Monte de Piedad organization in Spain was founded in Madrid, and from there the idea was transferred to New Spain by Pedro Romero de Terreros, the Count of Santa Maria de Regla and Knight of Calatrava. The Nacional Monte de Piedad is a charitable institution and pawn shop whose main office is located just off the Zocalo, or main plaza of Mexico City. It was established between 1774 and 1777 by Pedro Romero de Terreros as part of a movement to provide interest-free or low-interest loans to the poor. It was recognized as a national charity in 1927 by the Mexican government. Today it is a fast-growing institution with over 152 branches all over Mexico and with plans to open a branch in every Mexican city.\n\nThe pawnbrokers' symbol is three spheres suspended from a bar. The three sphere symbol is attributed to the Medici family of Florence, Italy, owing to its symbolic meaning of Lombard. This refers to the Italian region of Lombardy, where pawn shop banking originated under the name of Lombard banking. The three golden spheres were originally a symbol medieval Lombard merchants hung in front of their houses, and not the arms of the Medici family. It has been conjectured that the golden spheres were originally three flat yellow effigies of bezants, or gold coins, laid heraldically upon a sable field, but that they were converted into spheres to better attract attention.\n\nMost European towns called the pawn shop the \"Lombard\". The House of Lombard was a banking community in medieval London, England. According to legend, a Medici employed by Charlemagne slew a giant using three bags of rocks. The three-ball symbol became the family crest. Since the Medicis were so successful in the financial, banking, and moneylending industries, other families also adopted the symbol. Throughout the Middle Ages, coats of arms bore three balls, orbs, plates, discs, coins and more as symbols of monetary success.\n\nSaint Nicholas is the patron saint of pawnbrokers. The symbol has also been attributed to the story of Nicholas giving a poor man's three daughters each a bag of gold so they could get married.\n\nIn Hong Kong the practice follows the Chinese tradition, and the counter of the shop is typically higher than the average person for security. A customer can only hold up his hand to offer belongings and there is a wooden screen between the door and the counter for customers' privacy. The symbol of a pawn shop in Hong Kong is a bat holding a coin (, Cantonese: \"fūk syú diu gām chín\"). The bat signifies fortune and the coin signifies benefits. In Japan, the usual symbol for a pawn shop is a circled number seven (7) because \"shichi\", the Japanese word for seven, sounds similar to the word for \"pawn\" ().\n\nThe majority of pawnbrokers in Malaysia, a multi-race country wherein Malaysian Chinese consists 25% of the population, are managed by Malaysian Chinese. In Malay, pawn is called \"pajak gadai\". A valid and licensed pawnshop in Malaysia must always declare themselves as a \"pajak gadai\" or a pawn shop for their company registration. They must also fulfill the requirements of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government which states the pawn counter must not be higher than 4 feet, is bullet-proof, has stainless-steel counters/doors, strong rooms with automatic locks, safes, equipped with fully computerized system, CCTV, alarm, and pawnbroker insurance.\n\nIn the Philippines, the operation of pawnshops is managed by private businesses and is duly regulated by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. Pawn shops usually accept gold jewelry, appliances, gadgets, etc. Many pawn shops in the Philippines have adapted other services into their nationwide branches like Tambunting Pawnshop. Services like international and domestic remittance, insurance, bills payment, b2b money collection, e-loading for mobile phones, ticketing, and even banking are not unusual to see in a regular Filipino pawn shop. Pawnhero is an online Filipino pawnshop.\n\nIn India, the Marwari Jain community pioneered the pawnbroking business, but today others are involved; the work is done by many agents called \"saudagar\". Instead of working from a shop, they go to needy people's homes and motivate them to become involved in the business. Pawn shops are often run as part of jewelry stores. Gold, silver, and diamonds are frequently accepted as collateral.\n\nPawnbroking is also a traditional trade in Thailand, where pawn shops are run both privately and by local governments.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, pawnbroking is a lucrative business engaged in by specialized pawnbrokers as well as commercial banks and other finance companies.\n\nIn Indonesia, there is a state-owned company called Pegadaian which provides a range of conventional and Sharia-compliant pawnbroking services across the archipelago. The company accepts high-value items such as gold, motor vehicles, and other expensive items as collateral. In addition to pawnbroking activities, the company provides a range of other services, such as a safe deposit box and gold trading services.\n"}

{"id": "18006808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18006808", "title": "Play (activity)", "text": "Play (activity)\n\nIn psychology and ethology, play is a range of voluntary, activities done for recreational pleasure and enjoyment. Play is commonly associated with children and juvenile-level activities, but play occurs at any life stage, and among other higher-functioning animals as well, most notably mammals.\n\nMany prominent researchers in the field of psychology, including Melanie Klein, Jean Piaget, William James, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and Lev Vygotsky have viewed play as confined to the human species, believing play was important for human development and using different research methods to prove their theories.\n\nPlay is often interpreted as frivolous; yet the player can be intently focused on their objective, particularly when play is structured and goal-oriented, as in a game. Accordingly, play can range from relaxed, free-spirited and spontaneous through frivolous to planned or even compulsive. Play is not just a pastime activity; it has the potential to serve as an important tool in numerous aspects of daily life for adolescents, adults, and cognitively advanced non-human species (such as primates). Not only does play promote and aid in physical development (such as hand-eye coordination), but it also aids in cognitive development and social skills, and can even act as a stepping stone into the world of integration, which can be a very stressful process. Play is something that most children partake in, but the way play is executed is different between cultures and the way that children engage with play varies universally.\n\nThe seminal text in the field of play studies is the book \"Homo Ludens\" first published in 1944 with several subsequent editions, in which Johan Huizinga defines play as follows:\nThis definition of play as constituting a separate and independent sphere of human activity is sometimes referred to as the \"magic circle\" notion of play, a phrase also attributed to Huizinga. Many other definitions exist. Jean Piaget stated, \"the many theories of play expounded in the past are clear proof that the phenomenon is difficult to understand.\"\n\nPlay can take the form of improvisation or pretence, interactive, performance, mimicry, games, sports, and thrill-seeking, such as extreme or dangerous sports (sky-diving, high-speed racing, etc.). Philosopher Roger Caillois wrote about play in his 1961 book \"Man, Play and Games\" and Stephen Nachmanovitch expanded on these concepts in his 1990 book \"Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art\". Nachmanovitch writes that:\n\nStructured play has clearly defined goals and rules and such play is called a \"game\". Other play is unstructured or open-ended. Both types of play promote adaptive behaviors and mental states of happiness.\n\nSports with defined rules will take place within designated play spaces, such as sports fields where, in Soccer for example, players kick a ball in a certain direction and push opponents out of their way as they do so. While appropriate within the sport's play space, these same behaviors might be inappropriate or even illegal outside the playing field.\n\nOther designed play spaces can be playgrounds with dedicated equipment and structures to promote active and social play. Some play spaces go even farther in specialization to bring the play indoors and will often charge admission as seen at Children's Museums, Science Centers, or Family Entertainment Centers. Family Entertainment Centers (or Play Zones) are typically For-Profit businesses purely for play and entertainment, while Children's Museums and Science Centers are typically Non-Profit organizations for educational entertainment.\n\nThe California-based National Institute for Play describes seven play patterns:\n\nSeparate from self-initiated play, play therapy is used as a clinical application of play aimed at treating children who suffer from trauma, emotional issues and other problems.\n\nIn young children, play is frequently associated with cognitive development and socialization. Play that promotes learning and recreation often incorporates toys, props, tools or other playmates. Play can consist of an amusing, pretend or imaginary activity alone or with another. Some forms of play are rehearsals or trials for later life events, such as \"play fighting\", pretend social encounters (such as parties with dolls), or flirting. Modern findings in neuroscience suggest that play promotes flexibility of mind, including adaptive practices such as discovering multiple ways to achieve a desired result, or creative ways to improve or reorganize a given situation (Millar, 1967; Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000).\n\nAs children get older, they engage in board games, video games and computer play, and in this context the word gameplay is used to describe the concept and theory of play and its relationship to rules and game design. In their book, \"Rules of Play\", researchers Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman outline 18 schemas for games, using them to define \"play\", \"interaction\" and \"design\" formally for behaviorists. Similarly, in his book \"Half-Real: Video Games between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds\", game researcher and theorist Jesper Juul explores the relationship between real rules and unreal scenarios in play, such as winning or losing a game in the real world when played together with real-world friends, but doing so by slaying a dragon in the fantasy world presented in the shared video game.\nLearning through play has been long recognized as a critical aspect of childhood and child development. Some of the earliest studies of play started in the 1890s with G. Stanley Hall, the father of the child study movement that sparked an interest in the developmental, mental and behavioral world of babies and children. Play also promotes healthy development of parent-child bonds, establishing social, emotional and cognitive developmental milestones that help them relate to others, manage stress, and learn resiliency.\n\nModern research in the field of affective neuroscience (the neural mechanisms of emotion) has uncovered important links between role play and neurogenesis in the brain. For example, researcher Roger Caillois used the word \"ilinx\" to describe the momentary disruption of perception that comes from forms of physical play that disorient the senses, especially balance.\n\nStudies have found that play and coping to daily stressors to be positively correlated in children. By playing, children regulate their emotions and this is important for adaptive functioning because without regulation, emotions could be overwhelming and stressful.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists have begun to explore the phylogenetic relationship between higher intelligence in humans and its relationship to play, i.e., the relationship of play to the progress of whole evolutionary groups as opposed to the psychological implications of play to a specific individual.\n\nPlay is explicitly recognized in Article 31 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, November 29, 1989), which declares:\n\nAmerican historian Howard Chudacoff has studied the interplay between parental control of toys and games and children's drive for freedom to play. In the colonial era, toys were makeshift and children taught each other very simple games with little adult supervision. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the modern concept of childhood as a distinct, happy life stage. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted young girls. Organized sports filtered down from adults and colleges, and boys learned to play with a bat, a ball and an impromptu playing field. In the 20th century, teenagers were increasingly organized into club sports supervised and coached by adults, with swimming taught at summer camps and through supervised playgrounds. Under the New Deal's Works Progress Administration, thousands of local playgrounds and ball fields opened, promoting softball especially as a sport for all ages and both sexes. By the 21st century, Chudacoff notes, the old tension between parental controls and a child’s individual freedom was being played out in cyberspace.\n\nThe act of play time is a cross-cultural phenomenon that is universally accepted and encouraged by most communities however it can differ in the ways that is performed.\n\nSome cultures, such as Euro-American cultural heritages, encourage play time in order to stress cognitive benefits and the importance of learning how to care for one’s self. Other cultures, such as people of African American or Asian American heritages, stress more group oriented learning and play where kids can learn what they can do with and for others.\n\nParent interactions when it comes to playtime also differs drastically within communities. Parents in the Mayan culture do interact with their children in a playful mindset while parents in the United States tend to set aside time to play and teach their children through games and activities. In the Mayan community, children are supported in their playing but also encouraged to play while watching their parents do household work in order to become familiar with how to follow in their footsteps.\n\nIn addition, cultural communities also partake in similar games just with slight differences. Children in contemporary industrialized social cultural contexts will spend much of their free play time viewing television or other electronic activity such as video games. People from the Brazilian community use the tools and materials around them to create a form of play. For instance they use mud balls or cashews to play marbles, a game many communities play with small marbles. Communities in the Sahara will use clay figures as their forms of playful toys. Children from Australia and Nepal will engage in mud play.\n\nPlay time can also be used as a way for children to learn the mature ways of their culture. Many communities use play as a way children can emulate work. For instance, children can be seen comforting their toy dolls or animals something that they have modeled from adults in their communities. Children from San Pedro and Efe can be seen making ‘food’ from dirt or pretending to shoot bows and arrows much like their elders. The way in which children mimic work through their play can differ with what opportunities they have access to but is something that tends to be promoted by adults.\n\nSportive activities are one of the most universal forms of play. Different continents have their own popular/dominant sports. For example, European, South American, and African countries enjoy soccer (also known as ‘football’ in Europe), while North American countries prefer basketball, ice hockey, baseball, or American football. In Asia, sports such as table tennis and badminton are played professionally; however soccer and basketball are played amongst common folks. Events such as The Olympic Games and FIFA World Cup showcase countries competing with each other and are broadcast all over the world.\n\nSports can be played as a leisure activity or within a competition. According to sociologist Norbert Elias; it is an important part of \"civilization process\". Victory and defeat in sports can also influence one’s emotions to a point where everything else seems so irrelevant. Sport fans can also imagine what it feels like to play for their preferred team. The feelings people experience can be so surreal that it affects their emotions and behaviour.\n\nYouth sport can provide a positive outcome for youth development. Research shows adolescents are more motivated and engaged in sports than any other activity, and these conditions predict a richer personal and interpersonal development. Anxiety, depression and obesity can stem from lack of activity and social interaction. There is a high correlation between the amount of time that youth spend playing sports and the effects of physical (e.g., better general health), psychological (e.g., subjective well being), academic (e.g., school grades), and social benefits (e.g., making friends). Electronics over the past 10 years have been looked as a form of playtime but researchers have found that most electronic play leads to lack of motivation, no social interaction and can lead to obesity. Play is originally based on the idea of children using their creativity while developing their imagination, dexterity, physical, cognitive and emotional strength. Dramatic play is common in younger children. For the youth community to benefit from playtime, the following are recommended: \n\n\nWith regular participation in a variety of sports, children can develop and become more proficient at various sports skills (including, but not limited to, jumping, kicking, running, throwing, etc.) if the focus is on skill mastery and development. Young people participating in sports also develop agility, coordination, endurance, flexibility, speed, and strength. More specifically, young athletes could develop the following \n\nMoreover, research shows that regular participation in sport and physical activity is highly associated with lowering the risk of diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other related diseases. Young people also tend to be more nutrition-conscious in their food choices when participating in sport Girls involved in sport tend associate with lower chance of teenage pregnancy, begin smoking, and/or developing breast cancer. Young athletes have shown lower levels of total cholesterol and other favorable profiles in serum lipid parameters associated with cardiovascular disease. Sport provides an arena for young people to be physically active and in result reduce the time spent in sedentary pursuits, such as watching TV and playing video games.\n\nAlthough adults who engage in excessive amounts of play may find themselves described as \"childish\" or \"young at heart\" by less playful adults, play is actually an important activity, regardless of age. Creativity and happiness can result from adult play, where the objective can be more than fun alone, as in adult expression of the arts, or curiosity-driven science. Some adult \"hobbies\" are examples of such creative play. In creative professions, such as design, playfulness can remove more serious attitudes (such as shame or embarrassment) that impede brainstorming or artistic experimentation in design.\n\nImaginative play and role play may allow adult individuals to practice useful habits such as learned optimism, which is helpful in managing fear or terrors. Play also offers adults the opportunity to practice concepts that may not have been explicitly or formally taught (e.g. how to manage misinformation or deceit). Thus, even though play is just one of many tools used by effective adults, it remains a necessary one.\nThere has been extensive research when it comes to the benefits of play amongst children, youth, and adolescence. Most commonly overlooked are the benefits of play for adults, more specifically, adults who spend a lot of time in the workplace. Many adults in North America are in the workforce and spend half of their waking hours in a workplace environment with little to no time for play. Play in this context refers to leisure-type activities with colleagues during lunch breaks or short breaks throughout the working day. Leisure activities could include, but are not limited to, different forms of physical sport activities, card games, board games, video games and interaction-based type video games, foosball, ping-pong, yoga, and boot-camp sessions.\n\nResearch shows that playing games may promote a persistent and optimistic motivational style and positive affect. Positive affect enhances people’s experiences, enjoyment, and sense of satisfaction derived from the activity, during their engagement with a certain task. While people are engaged in their work, positive affect increases the satisfaction they feel from the work, and this has also been shown to increase their creativity and improve their performance on problem-solving tasks as well as other tasks. The development of a persistent motivational style charged with positive affect may lead to lasting work success.\n\nStudies show that work and play are mutually supportive. Employees need to experience the sense of newness, flow, discovery and liveliness that play provides. By doing this, it will provide the employee with the sense that they are integrated within the organization, and therefore they will feel and perform better. \nBy incorporating play at work, it will also result in more productivity, creativity and innovation, higher job satisfaction, greater workplace morale, stronger or new social bonds, improved job performance, a decrease in staff turnover, absenteeism and stress. Decreased stress leads to less illness, which results in lower health care costs. Play at work may help employees function and cope when under stress, refresh body and mind, encourage teamwork, trigger creativity, and increase energy while preventing burnout.\n\nStudies show that companies that encourage play at work, whether short breaks throughout the day or during lunch breaks experience more success because it leads to positive emotion amongst employees. Risk taking, confidence in presenting novel ideas, and embracing unusual and fresh perspectives are common characteristics associated with play at work. Play can increase self-reported job satisfaction and well-being. Employees experiencing positive emotions are more cooperative, more social, and perform better when faced with complex tasks.\n\nContests, team-building exercises, fitness programs, mental health breaks and other social activities, will make the work environment fun, interactive, and rewarding. Also playfighting, i. e. playful fights or fictive disputes, may contribute to organizations and institutions, as in youth care settings. Staff tries to down-key playfight invitations to “treatment” or “learning,” but playfighting also offers youth and staff identificatory respite from the institutional regime. Wästerfors (2016) has found that playfighting is a recurrent pattern in the social life of a youth care institution and sits at the core of what inmates and staff have to deal with \n\nOlder adults represent one of the fastest growing populations around the world. In fact, the United Nations predicted an increase of those aged 60 and above from 629 million in 2002 to approximately two billion in 2050 but increased life expectancy does not necessarily translate to a better quality of life. For this reason, research has begun to investigate methods to maintain and/or improve quality of life among older adults.\n\nSimilar to the data surrounding children and adults, play and activity are associated with improved health and quality of life among seniors. Additionally, play and activity tend to affect successful aging as well as boost well-being throughout the lifespan. Although children, adults, and seniors all tend to benefit from play, older adults often perform it in unique ways to account for possible issues, such as health restrictions, limited accessibility, and revised priorities. For this reason, elderly people may partake in physical exercise groups, interactive video games, and social forums specifically geared towards their needs and interests. One qualitative research study found older adults often chose to engage in specific games such as dominoes, checkers, and bingo for entertainment. Another study indicated a common pattern within game preferences among older adults; seniors often favor activities that encourage mental and physical fitness, incorporate past interests, have some level of competition, and foster a sense of belonging. Researchers investigating play in older adults are also interested in the benefits of technology and video games as therapeutic tools. Studies show these outlets can lower the risk of developing particular diseases, reduce feelings of social isolation and stress, as well as promote creativity and the maintenance of cognitive skills. As a result, play as been integrated into physiotherapy and occupational therapy interventions for seniors.\n\nThe ability to incorporate play into one's routine is important because these activities allow participants to express creativity, improve verbal and non-verbal intelligence as well as enhance balance. These benefits may be especially crucial to seniors because evidence shows cognitive and physical functioning declines with age. However, other research argues it might not be aging that is associated with the decline in cognitive and physical capabilities. More specifically, some studies indicate it could be the higher levels of inactivity within older adults that may have significant ramifications on their health and well-being.\n\nWith attention to these hypotheses, research shows play and activity tend to decline with age which may result in negative outcomes such as social isolation, depression, and mobility issues. American studies found that only 24% of seniors took part in regular physical activity and only 42% use the internet for entertainment purposes. In comparison to other age groups, the elderly are more likely to experience a variety of barriers, such as difficulty with environmental hazards and accessibility related issues, that may hinder their abilities to execute healthy play behaviours. Similarly, although playing may benefit seniors, it also has the potential to negatively impact their health. For example, those who play may be more susceptible to injury. Investigating these barriers may assist in the creation of useful interventions and/or the development of preventative measures, such as establishing safer recreational areas, that promote the maintenance of play behaviours throughout elderly life.\n\nA significant amount of literature suggests a moderate level of play has numerous positive outcomes in the lives of senior citizens. In order to support and promote play within the older population, studies suggest institutions should set up more diverse equipment, improve conditions within recreational areas, and create more video games or online forums that appeal to the needs of seniors.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists believe that there must be an important benefit of play, as there are so many reasons to avoid it. Animals are often injured during play, become distracted from predators, and expend valuable energy. In rare cases, play has even been observed between different species that are natural enemies such as a polar bear and a dog. Yet play seems to be a normal activity with animals who occupy the higher strata of their own hierarchy of needs. Animals on the lower strata, e.g. stressed and starving animals, generally do not play. However, in wild Assamese macaques physically active play is performed also during periods of low food availability and even if it is at the expense of growth, which strongly highlights the developmental and evolutionary importance of play.\n\nThe social cognitive complexity of numerous species, including dogs, have recently been explored in experimental studies. In one such study, conducted by Alexandra Horowitz of the University of California, the communication and attention-getting skills of dogs were investigated. In a natural setting, dyadic play behavior was observed; head-direction and posture was specifically noted. When one of the two dogs was facing away or otherwise preoccupied, attention-getting behaviors and signals (nudging, barking, growling, pawing, jumping, etc.) were used by the other dog to communicate the intent and/or desire to continue on with the dyadic play. Stronger or more frequent signaling was used if the attention of the other dog was not captured. These observations tell us that these dogs know how play behavior and signaling can be used to capture attention, communicate intent and desire, and manipulate one another. This characteristic and skill, called the \"attention-getting skill\" has generally only been seen in humans, but is now being researched and seen in many different species.\n\nObserving play behavior in various species can tell us a lot about the player's environment (including the welfare of the animal), personal needs, social rank (if any), immediate relationships, and eligibility for mating. Play activity, often observed through action and signals, often serves as a tool for communication and expression. Through mimicry, chasing, biting, and touching, animals will often act out in ways so as to send messages to one another; whether it's an alert, initiation of play, or expressing intent. When play behavior was observed for a study in Tonkean macaques, it was discovered that play signals weren't always used to initiate play; rather, these signals were viewed primarily as methods of communication (sharing information and attention-getting).\n\nOne theory – \"play as preparation\" – was inspired by the observation that play often mimics adult themes of survival. Predators such as lions and bears play by chasing, pouncing, pawing, wrestling, and biting, as they learn to stalk and kill prey. Prey animals such as deer and zebras play by running and leaping as they acquire speed and agility. Hoofed mammals also practice kicking their hind legs to learn to ward off attacks. Indeed, time spent in physical play accelerates motor skill acquisition in wild Assamese macaques. While mimicking adult behavior, attacking actions such as kicking and biting are not completely fulfilled, so playmates do not generally injure each other. In social animals, playing might also help to establish dominance rankings among the young to avoid conflicts as adults.\n\nJohn Byers, a zoologist at the University of Idaho, discovered that the amount of time spent at play for many mammals (e.g. rats and cats) peaks around puberty, and then drops off. This corresponds to the development of the cerebellum, suggesting that play is not so much about practicing \"exact\" behaviors, as much as building general connections in the brain. Sergio Pellis and colleagues at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada, discovered that play may shape the brain in other ways, too. Young mammals have an overabundance of brain cells in their cerebrum (the outer areas of the brain – part of what distinguishes mammals). There is evidence that play helps the brain clean up this excess of cells, resulting in a more efficient cerebrum at maturity.\n\nMarc Bekoff (a University of Colorado evolutionary biologist) proposes a \"flexibility\" hypothesis that attempts to incorporate these newer neurological findings. It argues that play helps animals learn to switch and improvise all behaviors more effectively, to be prepared for the unexpected. There may, however, be other ways to acquire even these benefits of play: the concept of equifinality. The idea is that the social benefits of play for many animals, for example, could instead be garnered by grooming. Patrick Bateson maintains that equifinality is exactly what play teaches. In accordance with the flexibility hypothesis, play may teach animals to avoid \"false endpoints\". In other words, they will harness the childlike tendency to keep playing with something that works \"well enough\", eventually allowing them to come up with something that might work better, if only in some situations. This also allows mammals to build up various skills that could come in handy in entirely novel situations. A study on two species of monkeys \"Presbytis entellus\" and \"Macaca mulatta\" that came into association with each other during food provisioning by pilgrims at the Ambagarh Forest Reserve, near Jaipur, India, shows the interspecific interaction that developed between the juveniles of the two species when opportunity presented itself.\n\nPlay has varying effects and benefits to human development. There has been an abundance of research on the effects of different forms of play and how they influence various areas of a person’s life whether it is a child or an adult. These benefits of play can have cognitive, social and emotional or motivational effects on a person’s life or development.\n\nPhysical play\n\nVarious forms of play, whether it is physical or mental, have influenced cognitive abilities in individuals. As little as ten minutes of exercise (including physical play), can improve cognitive abilities. These researchers did a study and have developed an \"exergame\" which is a game that incorporates some physical movement but is by no means formal exercise. These games increase one’s heart rate to the level of aerobics exercise and have proven to result in recognizable improvements in mental faculties \nIn this study they use play in a way that incorporates physical activity that creates physical excursions. The results of the study had statistical significance. There were improvements in math by 3.4% and general improvements in recall memory by 4% among the participants of the study.\nMental play\n\nOn the other hand, other research has focused on the cognitive effects of mentally stimulating play. Playing video games is one of the most common mediums of play for children and adults today. There has been mixed reviews on the effects of video games. Despite this, according to a research conducted by Hollis (2014),\n\"[playing video games] was positively associated with skills strongly related to academic success, such as time management, attention, executive control, memory, and spatial abilities – when playing video game occurs in moderation\".\n\nSocial development and play\n\nPlay can also influence one’s social development and social interactions. Much of the research focuses on the influence play has on child social development. There are different forms of play that have been noted to influence child social development. One study conducted by (Sullivan, 2003) explores the influence of playing styles with mothers versus playing styles with fathers and how it influences child social development. This article explains that \"integral to positive development is the child’s social competence or, more precisely, the ability to regulate their own emotions and behaviors in the social contexts of early childhood to support the effective accomplishment of relevant developmental tasks.\n\nSocial benefits of play have been measured using basic interpersonal values such as getting along with peers. One of the social benefits that this researcher has uncovered is that play with parents has proven to reduce anxiety in children. Having play time with parents that involves socially acceptable behaviour makes it easier for children to relate to be more socially adjusted to peers at school or at play Social development involving child interaction with peers is thus an area of influence for playful interactions with parents and peers.\n\n\n"}

In relativity, a different action must be minimized or maximized. The principle can be used to derive Newtonian, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian equations of motion, and even general relativity (see Einstein–Hilbert action). The physicist Paul Dirac, and after him Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman, demonstrated how this principle can also be used in quantum calculations.\nIt was historically called \"least\" because its solution requires finding the path that has the least value. Its classical mechanics and electromagnetic expressions are a consequence of quantum mechanics, but the stationary action method helped in the development of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe principle remains central in modern physics and mathematics, being applied in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, particle physics, and string theory and is a focus of modern mathematical investigation in Morse theory. Maupertuis' principle and Hamilton's principle exemplify the principle of stationary action.\n\nThe action principle is preceded by earlier ideas in optics. In ancient Greece, Euclid wrote in his \"Catoptrica\" that, for the path of light reflecting from a mirror, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Hero of Alexandria later showed that this path was the shortest length and least time.\n\nScholars often credit Pierre Louis Maupertuis for formulating the principle of least action because he wrote about it in 1744 and 1746. However, Leonhard Euler discussed the principle in 1744, and evidence shows that Gottfried Leibniz preceded both by 39 years.\n\nIn 1933, Paul Dirac discerned the quantum mechanical underpinning of the principle in the quantum interference of amplitudes.\n\nThe starting point is the \"action\", denoted formula_1 (calligraphic S), of a physical system. It is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian \"L\" between two instants of time \"t\" and \"t\" - technically a functional of the \"N\" generalized coordinates q = (\"q\", \"q\", ... , \"q\") which define the configuration of the system:\n\nwhere the dot denotes the time derivative, and \"t\" is time.\n\nMathematically the principle is\n\nwhere \"δ\" (lowercase Greek delta) means a \"small\" change. In words this reads:\n\nIn applications the statement and definition of action are taken together:\n\nThe action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term \"path\" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the coordinates in the configuration space, i.e. the curve q(\"t\"), parameterized by time (see also parametric equation for this concept).\n\nIn the 1600s, Pierre de Fermat postulated that \"\"light travels between two given points along the path of shortest time\",\" which is known as the principle of least time or Fermat's principle.\n\nCredit for the formulation of the principle of least action is commonly given to Pierre Louis Maupertuis, who felt that \"Nature is thrifty in all its actions\", and applied the principle broadly:\n\nThis notion of Maupertuis, although somewhat deterministic today, does capture much of the essence of mechanics.\n\nIn application to physics, Maupertuis suggested that the quantity to be minimized was the product of the duration (time) of movement within a system by the \"vis viva\",\n\nwhich is the integral of twice what we now call the kinetic energy \"T\" of the system.\n\nLeonhard Euler gave a formulation of the action principle in 1744, in very recognizable terms, in the \"Additamentum 2\" to his \"Methodus Inveniendi Lineas Curvas Maximi Minive Proprietate Gaudentes\". Beginning with the second paragraph:\n\nAs Euler states, ∫\"Mv\"d\"s\" is the integral of the momentum over distance travelled, which, in modern notation, equals the abbreviated or reduced action\n\nThus, Euler made an equivalent and (apparently) independent statement of the variational principle in the same year as Maupertuis, albeit slightly later. Curiously, Euler did not claim any priority, as the following episode shows.\n\nMaupertuis' priority was disputed in 1751 by the mathematician Samuel König, who claimed that it had been invented by Gottfried Leibniz in 1707. Although similar to many of Leibniz's arguments, the principle itself has not been documented in Leibniz's works. König himself showed a \"copy\" of a 1707 letter from Leibniz to Jacob Hermann with the principle, but the \"original\" letter has been lost. In contentious proceedings, König was accused of forgery, and even the King of Prussia entered the debate, defending Maupertuis (the head of his Academy), while Voltaire defended König.\n\nEuler, rather than claiming priority, was a staunch defender of Maupertuis, and Euler himself prosecuted König for forgery before the Berlin Academy on 13 April 1752. The claims of forgery were re-examined 150 years later, and archival work by C.I. Gerhardt in 1898 and W. Kabitz in 1913 uncovered other copies of the letter, and three others cited by König, in the Bernoulli archives.\n\nEuler continued to write on the topic; in his \"Reflexions sur quelques loix generales de la nature\" (1748), he called the quantity \"effort\". His expression corresponds to what we would now call potential energy, so that his statement of least action in statics is equivalent to the principle that a system of bodies at rest will adopt a configuration that minimizes total potential energy.\n\nMuch of the calculus of variations was stated by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1760 and he proceeded to apply this to problems in dynamics. In \"Méchanique Analytique\" (1788) Lagrange derived the general equations of motion of a mechanical body. William Rowan Hamilton in 1834 and 1835 applied the variational principle to the classical Lagrangian function\n\nto obtain the Euler–Lagrange equations in their present form.\n\nIn 1842, Carl Gustav Jacobi tackled the problem of whether the variational principle always found minima as opposed to other stationary points (maxima or stationary saddle points); most of his work focused on geodesics on two-dimensional surfaces. The first clear general statements were given by Marston Morse in the 1920s and 1930s, leading to what is now known as Morse theory. For example, Morse showed that the number of conjugate points in a trajectory equalled the number of negative eigenvalues in the second variation of the Lagrangian.\n\nOther extremal principles of classical mechanics have been formulated, such as Gauss's principle of least constraint and its corollary, Hertz's principle of least curvature.\n\nThe mathematical equivalence of the differential equations of motion and their integral\ncounterpart has important philosophical implications. The differential equations are statements about quantities localized to a single point in space or single moment of time. For example, Newton's second law\n\nstates that the \"instantaneous\" force F applied to a mass \"m\" produces an acceleration a at the same \"instant\". By contrast, the action principle is not localized to a point; rather, it involves integrals over an interval of time and (for fields) an extended region of space. Moreover, in the usual formulation of classical action principles, the initial and final states of the system are fixed, e.g.,\n\nIn particular, the fixing of the \"final\" state has been interpreted as giving the action principle a teleological character which has been controversial historically. However, according to W. Yourgrau and S. Mandelstam, \"the teleological approach... presupposes that the variational principles themselves have mathematical characteristics which they \"de facto\" do not possess\" In addition, some critics maintain this apparent teleology occurs because of the way in which the question was asked. By specifying some but not all aspects of both the initial and final conditions (the positions but not the velocities) we are making some inferences about the initial conditions from the final conditions, and it is this \"backward\" inference that can be seen as a teleological explanation. Teleology can also be overcome if we consider the classical description as a limiting case of the quantum formalism of path integration, in which stationary paths are obtained as a result of interference of amplitudes along all possible paths.\n\nThe short story \"Story of Your Life\" by the speculative fiction writer Ted Chiang contains visual depictions of Fermat's Principle along with a discussion of its teleological dimension. Keith Devlin's \"The Math Instinct\" contains a chapter, \"Elvis the Welsh Corgi Who Can Do Calculus\" that discusses the calculus \"embedded\" in some animals as they solve the \"least time\" problem in actual situations.\n\n"}
{"id": "3076576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3076576", "title": "Public morality", "text": "Public morality\n\nPublic morality refers to moral and ethical standards enforced in a society, by law or police work or social pressure, and applied to public life, to the content of the media, and to conduct in public places. A famous remark of Mrs Patrick Campbell, that she did not care what people did as long as they \"didn't frighten the horses\" shows that in some sense even high tolerance expects a \"public\" limitation on behaviour (sexual conduct is implied here). At the opposite extreme a theocracy may equate public morality with religious instruction, and give both the equal force of law.\n\nPublic morality often means regulation of sexual matters, including prostitution and homosexuality, but also matters of dress and nudity, pornography, acceptability in social terms of cohabitation before marriage, and the protection of children. It is a main justification for censorship; it can lead to campaigns against profanity, and so be at odds with freedom of speech. Gambling is generally controlled: casinos have been considered much more of a threat than large-scale lotteries or football pools. Public drunkenness is quite unacceptable in some societies, and legal control of consumption of alcohol is often justified in terms of public morality, just as much as for medical reasons or to limit alcohol-related crime. Drug legislation, historically speaking, has sometimes followed on similar reasoning. Abortion is sometimes treated as an aspect of public morality, even if it is legally defined, regulated by medical professionals, and almost entirely hidden from public view. AIDS as a health policy issue is linked to public morality in a complicated manner.\n\nViews on public morality do change over time. For example, there have been proscriptions against eating in the street or allowing women to smoke in public. These examples show that public views on which things which are acceptable often move towards wider tolerance. Rapid shifts the other way are often characterised by moral panics, as in the shutting down of theatres a generation after Shakespeare's death by the English Puritans.\n\nIt may also be applied to the \"morals of public life\". Political corruption, or the telling of lies in public statements, tarnish not only individual politicians, but the entire conduct of political life, whether at local or national level. These are fairly universally regarded as blots on reputations, though in some cases there is a grey area between corruption and legitimate fund-raising. Whether the private lives of politicians are a public morals issue is not a matter of agreement, internationally speaking; the existence of an extramarital relationship of a Prime Minister would in some countries be considered a revelation well within the sphere of the public interest, while in other countries it would be considered quite irrelevant.\n\n"}
{"id": "476228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=476228", "title": "Regression fallacy", "text": "Regression fallacy\n\nThe regression (or regressive) fallacy is an informal fallacy. It assumes that something has returned to normal because of corrective actions taken while it was abnormal. This fails to account for natural fluctuations. It is frequently a special kind of the post hoc fallacy.\n\nThings like golf scores, the earth's temperature, and chronic back pain fluctuate naturally and usually regress towards the mean. The logical flaw is to make predictions that expect exceptional results to continue as if they were average (see Representativeness heuristic). People are most likely to take action when variance is at its peak. Then after results become more normal they believe that their action was the cause of the change when in fact it was not causal.\n\nThis use of the word \"regression\" was coined by Sir Francis Galton in a study from 1885 called \"Regression Toward Mediocrity in Hereditary Stature\". He showed that the height of children from very short or very tall parents would move towards the average. In fact, in any situation where two variables are less than perfectly correlated, an exceptional score on one variable may not be matched by an equally exceptional score on the other variable. The imperfect correlation between parents and children (height is not entirely heritable) means that the distribution of heights of their children will be centered somewhere between the average of the parents and the average of the population as whole. Thus, any single child can be more extreme than the parents, but the odds are against it.\n\nWhen his pain got worse, he went to a doctor, after which the pain subsided a little. Therefore, he benefited from the doctor's treatment.\n\nThe pain subsiding a little after it has gotten worse is more easily explained by regression towards the mean. Assuming the pain relief was caused by the doctor is fallacious.\n\nThe student did exceptionally poorly last semester, so I punished him. He did much better this semester. Clearly, punishment is effective in improving students' grades.\n\nOften exceptional performances are followed by more normal performances, so the change in performance might better be explained by regression towards the mean. Incidentally, some experiments have shown that people may develop a systematic bias for punishment and against reward because of reasoning analogous to this example of the regression fallacy.\n\nThe frequency of accidents on a road fell after a speed camera was installed. Therefore, the speed camera has improved road safety.\n\nSpeed cameras are often installed after a road incurs an exceptionally high number of accidents, and this value usually falls (regression to mean) immediately afterwards. Many speed camera proponents attribute this fall in accidents to the speed camera, without observing the overall trend.\n\nSome authors use the \"Sports Illustrated\" cover jinx as an example of a regression effect: extremely good performances are likely to be followed by less extreme ones, and athletes are chosen to appear on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" only after extreme performances. Attributing this to a \"jinx\" rather than regression, as some athletes reportedly believe, is an example of committing the regression fallacy.\n\nOn the other hand, dismissing valid explanations can lead to a worse situation. For example:\nAfter the Western Allies invaded Normandy, creating a second major front, German control of Europe waned. Clearly, the combination of the Western Allies and the USSR drove the Germans back.\n\n\"Fallacious evaluation:\" \"Given that the counterattacks against Germany occurred only after they had conquered the greatest amount of territory under their control, regression to the mean can explain the retreat of German forces from occupied territories as a purely random fluctuation that would have happened without any intervention on the part of the USSR or the Western Allies.\" However, this was not the case. The reason is that political power and occupation of territories is not primarily determined by random events, making the concept of regression to the mean inapplicable (on the large scale).\n\nIn essence, misapplication of regression to the mean can reduce all events to a \"just so\" story, without cause or effect. (Such misapplication takes as a premise that all events are random, as they must be for the concept of regression to the mean to be validly applied.)\n\n\n"}

In other words, the model calculates the conversion of rainfall into runoff.<br>\nA well known runoff model is the \"linear reservoir\", but in practice it has limited applicability.<br>\nThe runoff model with a \"non-linear reservoir\" is more universally applicable, but still it holds only for catchments whose surface area is limited by the condition that the rainfall can be considered more or less uniformly distributed over the area. The maximum size of the watershed then depends on the rainfall characteristics of the region. When the study area is too large, it can be divided into sub-catchments and the various runoff hydrographs may be combined using flood routing techniques.<br>\n\nRainfall-runoff models need to be calibrated before they can be used.\n\nThe hydrology of a linear reservoir (figure 1) is governed by two equations.\nwhere:<br>\nQ is the \"runoff\" or\" discharge\" <br>\nR is the \"effective rainfall\" or \"rainfall excess\" or \"recharge\" <br>\nA is the constant \"reaction factor\" or \"response factor\" with unit [1/T] <br>\nS is the water storage with unit [L] <br>\ndS is a differential or small increment of S<br> \ndT is a differential or small increment of T\n\nRunoff equation<br>\nA combination of the two previous equations results in a differential equation, whose solution is:\nThis is the \"runoff equation\" or \"discharge equation\", where Q1 and Q2 are the values of Q at time T1 and T2 respectively while T2−T1 is a small time step during which the recharge can be assumed constant.\n\nComputing the total hydrograph<br>\nProvided the value of A is known, the \"total hydrograph\" can be obtained using a successive number of time steps and computing, with the \"runoff equation\", the runoff at the end of each time step from the runoff at the end of the previous time step.\n\nUnit hydrograph<br>\nThe discharge may also be expressed as: Q = − dS/dT .

With this method the reservoir can be used as a black box model.\n\nConversions<br>\n1 mm/day corresponds to 10 m/day per ha of the watershed<br>\n1 l/s per ha corresponds to 8.64 mm/day or 86.4 m/day per ha\n\nContrary to the linear reservoir, the non linear reservoir has a reaction factor A that is not a constant, but it is a function of S or Q (figure 2, 3).\n\nNormally A increases with Q and S because the higher the water level is the higher the discharge capacity becomes. The factor is therefore called Aq instead of A.<br>\nThe non-linear reservoir has \"no\" usable unit hydrograph.\n\nDuring periods without rainfall or recharge, i.e. when \"R\" = 0, the runoff equation reduces to\nor, using a \"unit time step\" (T2 − T1 = 1) and solving for Aq:\nHence, the reaction or response factor Aq can be determined from runoff or discharge measurements using \"unit time steps\" during dry spells, employing a numerical method.\n\nFigure 3 shows the relation between Aq (Alpha) and Q for a small valley (Rogbom) in Sierra Leone.<br>\nFigure 4 shows observed and \"simulated\" or \"reconstructed\" discharge hydrograph of the watercourse at the downstream end of the same valley.\n\nThe recharge, also called \"effective rainfall\" or \"rainfall excess\", can be modeled by a \"pre-reservoir\" (figure 6) giving the recharge as \"overflow\". The pre-reservoir knows the following elements:\n\nThe recharge during a unit time step (T2−T1=1) can be found from \"R\" = Rain − Sd<br>\nThe actual storage at the end of a \"unit time step\" is found as Sa2 = Sa1 + Rain − \"R\" − Ea, where Sa1 is the actual storage at the start of the time step.\n\nThe Curve Number method (CN method) gives another way to calculate the recharge. The \"initial abstraction\" herein compares with Sm − Si, where Si is the initial value of Sa.\n\nThe Nash model uses a series (cascade) of linear reservoirs in which each reservoir empties into the next until the runoff is obtained. For calibration, the model requires considerable research.\n\nFigures 3 and 4 were made with the RainOff program, designed to analyse rainfall and runoff using the non-linear reservoir model with a pre-reservoir. The program also contains an example of the hydrograph of an agricultural subsurface drainage system for which the value of A can be obtained from the system's characteristics.\n\nThe SMART hydrological model includes agricultural subsurface drainage flow, in addition to soil and groundwater reservoirs, to simulate the flow path contributions to streamflow.\n\nV\"flo\" is another software program for modeling runoff. V\"flo\" uses radar rainfall and GIS data to generate physics-based, distributed runoff simulation.\n\nThe WEAP (Water Evaluation And Planning) software platform models runoff and percolation from climate and land use data, using a choice of linear and non-linear reservoir models.\n\nThe RS MINERVE software platform simulates the formation of free surface run-off flow and its propagation in rivers or channels. The software is based on object-oriented programming and allows hydrologic and hydraulic modeling according to a semi-distributed conceptual scheme with different rainfall-runoff model such as HBV, GR4J, SAC-SMA or SOCONT.\n"}

In the modern era, an evening dress or cocktail dress is customary for women.\n\nWhether one would choose to wear morning or evening semi-formal has traditionally been defined by whether the event will commence before or after 6:00 p.m.\nIn addition, equivalent versions may be permitted of semi-formally applicable ceremonial dresses (including court dresses, diplomatic uniforms and academic dresses), full dress uniforms, religious clothing, and national costumes, and military mess dresses.\n\nIn the daytime (before 6 p.m.), the semi-formal code requires for men a black tail-less lounge coat with vertical black and grey stripes or checked formal trousers, with a black waistcoat. This combination is a less formal version of morning dress, which features a longer, cutaway morning coat. This semi-formal ensemble is sometimes referred to as a \"stroller\" in North America, or a Marlborough suit in the United Kingdom. Because black was then reserved for formalwear, it was unknown as a color for lounge suits, so the term was unambiguous. In the U.K. this mode of dress is now extremely unusual, though some Masonic Lodges which meet during the day rather than (as is more common) in the evening do continue to specify it as their dress code. It also still is worn within the legal profession, especially by barristers. Indeed, the striped trousers are in some circles referred to as \"barrister trousers\". In German, a stroller is called a \"Stresemann\", after the German foreign secretary Gustav Stresemann. Stresemann, like other German politicians of his age, wore morning dress or a frock coat in the Reichstag or when making public appearances. However, Stresemann found the long coat impractical for daily work in the Chancellery. To avoid having to change completely, he began to wear the prototype of this jacket at his office, while switching to a morning coat when engaged on more formal business. The style quickly caught on as a more practical variation on morning dress. In Japan, it is known as a \"director's suit\", from the term \"inside director\".\n\nFor evening wear (after 6 p.m.), the corresponding code is black tie. In formal evening dress, or white tie dress, this practice of substituting colors in ties is much less common since men's fashion tends to follow tradition more deeply as it becomes more formal.\n\nThe origins of evening semi-formal attire date back to the later 19th century when Edward, Prince of Wales (subsequently Edward VII), wanted a more comfortable dinner attire than the swallowtail coat.\n\nIn the spring of 1886, the Prince invited James Potter, a rich New Yorker, and his wife Cora to Sandringham House, the Prince's hunting estate in Norfolk. When Potter asked for the Prince's dinner dress code, the Prince sent him to his tailor, Henry Poole & Co., in London, where he was given a suit made to the Prince's specifications with the dinner jacket.\n\nOn returning to Tuxedo Park, New York, in 1886, Potter's dinner suit proved popular at the Tuxedo Park Club. Not long afterward, when a group of men from the club chose to wear such suits to a dinner at Delmonico's Restaurant in New York City, other diners were surprised. They were told that such clothing was popular at Tuxedo Park, so the particular cut then became known as the \"tuxedo\".\n\nFrom its creation into the 1920s, this dinner jacket was considered appropriate dress for dining in one's home or club, while the tailcoat remained in place as appropriate for public appearance.\n\nEtiquette and clothing experts continue to discourage wearing of black tie as too informal for weddings, or indeed any event before 6 p.m., such as by Emily Post (1872-1960) and Amy Vanderbilt (1908-1974). The latter arguing that \"no man should ever be caught in a church in a tuxedo.\"\n"}
{"id": "2308124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308124", "title": "Sensory overload", "text": "Sensory overload\n\nSensory overload occurs when one or more of the body's senses experiences over-stimulation from the environment. There are many environmental elements that affect an individual. Examples of these elements are urbanization, crowding, noise, mass media, technology, and the explosive growth of information.\n\nThere are a wide variety of symptoms that have been found to be associated with sensory overload. These symptoms can occur in both children and adults. Some of these symptoms are:\n\nSensory overload can result from the overstimulation of any of the senses.\n\nSensory overload has been found to be associated with other disorders and conditions such as:\n\nThere are many different ways to treat sensory overload. One way to reduce this tension is to participate in occupational therapy; however, there are many ways for people with symptoms to reduce it themselves. Being able to identify one's own triggers of sensory overload can help reduce, eliminate, or avoid them. Most often the quickest way to ease sensory overload symptoms is to remove oneself from the situation. Deep pressure against the skin combined with proprioceptive input that stimulates the receptors in the joints and ligaments often calms the nervous system. Reducing sensory input such as eliminating distressing sounds and lowering the lights can help. Calming, focusing music works for some. If a quick break does not relieve the problem, an extended rest is advised. People with sensory processing issues may benefit from a sensory diet of activities and accommodations designed to prevent sensory overload and retrain the brain to process sensory input more typically. It is important in situations of sensory overload to calm oneself and return to a normal level.\n\nThere are two different methods to prevent sensory overload: avoidance and setting limits. The process of avoidance involves creating a more quiet and orderly environment. This includes keeping the noise to a minimum and reducing the sense of clutter. To prevent sensory overload, it is important to rest before big events and focus your attention and energy on one thing at a time. Setting limits involves restricting the amount of time spent on various activities and selecting settings to carefully avoid crowds and noise. One may also limit interactions with specific people to help prevent sensory overload.\n\nIt can be difficult to distinguish and understand information when experiencing sensory overload. Even such meaningless stimuli such as white noise or flickering lights may induce sensory overload. Sensory overload is common among consumers as many corporations compete with each other especially when advertising. Advertisers will use the best colours, words, sounds, textures, designs and much more to get the attention of a customer. This can influence the consumer, as they will be drawn to a product that is more attention grabbing. However, policy makers and advertisers must be aware\nthat too much information or attention-grabbing products can cause sensory overload.\n\nImplications of a public policy in regards to information overload have two main assumptions. The assumptions the policymakers have are, first, to assume that consumers have a great deal of processing capacity and a great deal of time to process information. Secondly, consumers can always absorb the information without serious concern about how much information has been presented. As researchers have pointed out, policymakers should better understand the difference between the process and availability of information. This will help decrease the possibility of information overload. In some cases, the time to process such information in a commercial can be 6 out of 30 seconds. This can lead consumers confused and overloaded with such fast paced information thrown at them. To understand how consumers process information three factors must be analyzed. Factors such as the amount of information given, the source of corrective information and the way in which it is all presented to the consumer. Different types of media have different processing demands. An optimal outcome for policy makers to influence advertisers to try is to present information through a TV commercial stating simple facts about a product and then encourage the audience to check out their website for more details. Therefore, their quick processing time of a commercial was not overloaded with information thus saving the consumer from sensory overload.\n\nConsumers today are forced to learn to cope with overloading and an abundance of information, through the radio, billboards, television, newspapers and much more. Information is everywhere and being thrown at consumers from every angle and direction. Therefore, Naresh K. Malhotra, the author of Information and Sensory Overload presents the following guidelines. First, consumers must try to limit the intake of external information and sensory inputs to avoid sensory overload. This can be done by tuning out irrelevant information presented by the media and marketers to get the attention of the consumer. Second, record important information externally rather than mentally. Information can be easily forgotten mentally once the individual becomes overloaded by their sense. Thus it is recommended for a consumer to write down important information rather than store it mentally. Third, when examining a product, do not overload their senses by examining more than five products at a time. This will lead to confusion and frustration. Fourth, process information where there is less irrelevant information around. This will eliminate external information and sensory distractions such as white noise and other information presented in an environment. Finally, it is important to make consuming a pleasant and relaxed experience. This will help diminish the stress, overwhelming feeling, and experience of sensory overload.\n\nUsing the senses in marketing can be a useful sales tactic. Most commonly, marketers will take advantage of the humans four out of five senses to increase the amount of information being presented to the customer. \n\nNot many studies have been done on sensory overload, but one example of a sensory overload study was reported by Lipowski (1975) as part of his research review on the topic that discussed the work done by Japanese researchers at Tohoku University. The Tohoku researchers exposed their subjects to intense visual and auditory stimuli presented randomly in a condition of confinement ranging in duration from three to five hours. Subjects showed heightened and sustained arousal as well as mood changes such as aggression, anxiety, and sadness. These results have helped open the door to further research on sensory overload.\n\nSociologist Georg Simmel contributed to the description of sensory overload in his 1903 essay \"The Metropolis and Mental Life.\" Simmel describes an urban landscape of constant sensory stimuli against which the city-dweller must create a barrier in order to remain sane. For Simmel, the sensory overload of modern urban life depletes the body’s reservoirs of energy, leading, among other things, to a jaded or blasé [blasiert] mentality and an calculating, instrumentalizing approach to others. Simmel's approach can be compared to Freud's writings on Shell shock as well as Walter Benjamin's analysis of \"shock\" and urban life in his 1939 essay \"On Some Motifs in Baudelaire.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "6116892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6116892", "title": "Sex and gender distinction", "text": "Sex and gender distinction\n\nThe distinction between sex and gender differentiates a person's biological sex (the anatomy of an individual's reproductive system, and secondary sex characteristics) from that person's gender, which can refer to either social roles based on the sex of the person (gender role) or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness (gender identity). In this model, the idea of a \"biological gender\" is an oxymoron: the biological aspects are not gender-related, and the gender-related aspects are not biological. In some circumstances, an individual's assigned sex and gender do not align, and the person may be transgender. In other cases, an individual may have biological sex characteristics that complicate sex assignment, and the person may be intersex.\n\nThe sex and gender distinction is not universal. In ordinary speech, \"sex\" and \"gender\" are often used interchangeably. Some dictionaries and academic disciplines give them different definitions while others do not. Some languages, such as German or Finnish, have no separate words for sex and gender, and the distinction has to be made through context. On occasion, using the English word \"gender\" is appropriate.\n\nAmong scientists, the term \"sex differences\" (as compared to \"gender differences\") is typically applied to sexually dimorphic traits that are hypothesized to be evolved consequences of sexual selection.\n\nAnisogamy, or the size differences of gametes (sex cells), is the defining feature of the two sexes. By definition, males have small, mobile gametes (sperm); females have large and generally immobile gametes (ova or eggs). In humans, typical male or female sexual differentiation includes the presence or absence of a Y chromosome, the type of gonads (ovary or testes), the balance of sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen), the internal reproductive anatomy (e.g. uterus or prostate gland), and the external genitalia (e.g. penis or vulva). People with mixed sex factors are intersex. People whose internal psychological experience differs from their assigned sex are transgender, transsexual, or non-binary.\n\nThe consensus among scientists is that all behaviors are phenotypes—complex interactions of both biology and environment—and thus nature vs. nurture is a misleading categorization. The term \"sex differences\" is typically applied to sexually dimorphic traits that are hypothesized to be evolved consequences of sexual selection. For example, the human \"sex difference\" in height is a consequence of sexual selection, while the \"gender difference\" typically seen in head hair length (women with longer hair) is not. Scientific research shows an individual's sex influences his or her behavior.\n\n\"Sex\" is annotated as different from \"gender\" in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", where it says \"sex\" \"tends now to refer to biological differences\". The World Health Organization (WHO) similarly states that \"'sex' refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women\" and that \"'male' and 'female' are sex categories\".\n\nThe \"American Heritage Dictionary\" (5th ed.), however, lists \"sex\" as both \"Either of the two divisions, designated female and male, by which most organisms are classified on the basis of their reproductive organs and functions\" and \"One's identity as either female or male,\" among other definitions.\n\nHistorian Thomas W. Laqueur suggests that from the Renaissance to the 18th century, there was a prevailing inclination among doctors towards the existence of only one biological sex (the one-sex theory, that women and men had the same fundamental reproductive structure). In some discourses, this view persisted into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Laqueur asserts that even at its peak, the one-sex model was supported among highly educated Europeans but is not known to have been a popular view nor one entirely agreed upon by doctors who treated the general population. Sex and gender took center stage in America in the time of wars, when women had to work and men were at war.\n\nIn the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", \"gender\" is defined as, \"[i]n mod[ern] (esp[escially] feminist) use, a euphemism for the sex of a human being, often intended to emphasize the social and cultural, as opposed to the biological, distinctions between the sexes.\", with the earliest example cited being from 1963. The \"American Heritage Dictionary\" (5th edition), in addition to defining gender the same way that it defines biological sex, also states that \"gender\" may be defined by identity as \"neither entirely female nor entirely male\"; its \"Usage Note\" adds:Some people maintain that the word \"sex\" should be reserved for reference to the biological aspects of being male or female or to sexual activity, and that the word \"gender\" should be used only to refer to sociocultural roles. ... In some situations this distinction avoids ambiguity, as in \"gender research\", which is clear in a way that \"sex research\" is not. The distinction can be problematic, however. Linguistically, there isn't any real difference between \"gender bias\" and \"sex bias\", and it may seem contrived to insist that \"sex\" is incorrect in this instance.\n\nA working definition in use by the World Health Organization for its work is that \"'[g]ender' refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women\" and that \"'masculine' and 'feminine' are gender categories.\" The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) used to use \"gender\" instead of \"sex\" when referring to physiological differences between male and female organisms. In 2011, they reversed their position on this and began using \"sex \"as the biological classification and \"gender\" as \"a person's self representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation.\" \"Gender\" is also now commonly used even to refer to the physiology of non-human animals, without any implication of social gender roles.\n\nGLAAD (formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) makes a distinction between sex and gender in their most recent Media Reference Guide: Sex is \"the classification of people as male or female\" at birth, based on bodily characteristics such as chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs, and genitalia. Gender identity is \"one's internal, personal sense of being a man or woman (or a boy or a girl)\".\n\nSome feminist philosophers maintain that gender is totally undetermined by sex. See, for example, \"The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution\", a widely influential feminist text.\n\nThe case of David Reimer, who was, according to studies published by John Money, raised as a girl after a botched circumcision, was described in the book \"As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl\". Reimer was in fact not comfortable as a girl and later changed gender identity back to male when discovered the truth of his surgery. He eventually committed suicide.\n\nGender in the sense of social and behavioral distinctions, according to archaeological evidence, arose \"at least by some 30,000 years ago\". More evidence was found as of \"26,000 years ago\", at least at the archeological site Dolní Věstonice I and others, in what is now the Czech Republic. This is during the Upper Paleolithic time period.\n\nThe historic meaning of \"gender\", ultimately derived from Latin \"genus\", was of \"kind\" or \"variety\". By the 20th century, this meaning was obsolete, and the only formal use of \"gender\" was in grammar. This changed in the early 1970s when the work of John Money, particularly the popular college textbook \"Man & Woman, Boy & Girl\", was embraced by feminist theory. This meaning of \"gender\" is now prevalent in the social sciences, although in many other contexts, \"gender\" includes \"sex\" or replaces it. Gender was first only used in languages to describe the feminine and masculine words, up until around the 1960s.\n\nJemima Repo has in her doctoral thesis \"The biopolitics of gender\" (2011) criticized the use of the term gender among feminists, because it has been used to justify biopolitical projects.\n\nSince the social sciences now distinguish between biologically defined \"sex\" and socially constructed \"gender\", the term \"gender\" is now also sometimes used by linguists to refer to social gender as well as grammatical gender. Traditionally, however, a distinction has been made by linguists between \"sex\" and \"gender\", where \"sex\" refers primarily to the attributes of real-world entities – the relevant extralinguistic attributes being, for instance, male, female, non-personal, and indeterminate sex – and grammatical gender refers to a category, such as masculine, feminine, and neuter (often based on sex, but not exclusively so in all languages), that determines the agreement between nouns of different genders and associated words, such as articles and adjectives.\n\"A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language\", for instance, states Thus German, for instance, has three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Nouns referring to people and animals of known sex are \"generally\" referred to by nouns with the equivalent gender. Thus \"Mann\" (meaning man) is masculine and is associated with a masculine definite article to give \"der Mann\", while \"Frau\" (meaning woman) is feminine and is associated with a feminine definite article to give \"die Frau\". However the words for inanimate objects are commonly masculine (e.g. \"der Tisch\", the table) or feminine (\"die Armbanduhr\", the watch), and grammatical gender can diverge from biological sex; for instance the feminine noun \"[die] Person\" refers to a person of either sex, and the neuter noun \"[das] Mädchen\" means \"the girl\".\n\nIn modern English, there is no true grammatical gender in this sense, though the differentiation, for instance, between the pronouns \"he\" and \"she\", which in English refers to a difference in sex (or social gender), is sometimes referred to as a gender distinction. \"A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language\", for instance, refers to the semantically based \"covert\" gender (e.g. male and female, not masculine and feminine) of English nouns, as opposed to the \"overt\" gender of some English pronouns; this yields \"nine\" gender classes: male, female, dual, common, collective, higher male animal, higher female animal, lower animal, and inanimate, and these semantic gender classes affect the possible choices of pronoun for coreference to the real-life entity, e.g. \"who\" and \"he\" for \"brother\" but \"which\" and \"it\" or \"she\" for \"cow\".\n\nUsed primarily in sociology and gender studies, \"doing gender\" is the socially constructed performance which takes place during routine human interactions, rather than as a set of essentialized qualities based on one's biological sex. The term first appeared in Candace West and Don Zimmerman’s article “Doing Gender”, published in the peer-reviewed journal, \"Gender and Society\". Originally written in 1977 but not published until 1987, \"Doing Gender\" is the most cited article published in \"Gender and Society\".\n\nWest and Zimmerman state that to understand gender as activity, it is important to differentiate between sex, sex category, and gender. They say that sex refers to the socially agreed upon specifications that establish one as male or female; sex is most often based on an individual's genitalia, or even their chromosomal typing before birth. They consider sex categories to be dichotomous, and that the person is placed in a sex category by exhibiting qualities exclusive to one category or the other. During most interactions, others situate a person's sex by identifying their sex category; however, they believe that a person's sex need not align with their sex category. West and Zimmerman maintain that the sex category is \"established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one’s membership in one or the other category\". Gender is the performance of attitudes and actions that are considered socially acceptable for one's sex category.\n\nWest and Zimmerman suggested that the interactional process of \"doing gender\", combined with socially agreed upon gender expectations, holds individuals accountable for their gender performances. They also believe that while \"doing gender\" appropriately strengthens and promotes social structures based on the gender dichotomy, it inappropriately does not call into question these same social structures; only the individual actor is questioned. The concept of \"doing gender\" recognizes that gender both structures human interactions and is created through them.\n\nThe current distinction between the terms \"sex difference\" versus \"gender difference\" has been criticized as misleading and counterproductive. These terms suggest that the behavior \"of an individual\" can be partitioned into separate biological and cultural factors. (However, behavioral differences between individuals can be statistically partitioned, as studied by behavioral genetics.) Instead, all behaviors are phenotypes—a complex interweaving of both nature and nurture.\n\nDiane Halpern, in her book \"Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities,\" argued problems with \"sex\" vs. \"gender\" terminology: \"I cannot argue (in this book) that nature and nurture are inseparable and then... use different terms to refer to each class of variables. The ...biological manifestations of sex are confounded with psychosocial variables... The use of different terms to label these two types of contributions to human existence seemed inappropriate in light of the biopsychosocial position I have taken.\" She quotes Steven Pinker's summary of the problems with the terms sex and gender: \"Part of it is a new prissiness -- many people today are as squeamish about sexual dimorphism as the Victorians were about sex. But part of it is a limitation of the English language. The word 'sex' refers ambiguously to copulation and to sexual dimorphism...\" Richard Lippa writes in \"Gender, Nature and Nurture\" that \"Some researchers have argued that the word \"sex\" should be used to refer to (biological differences), whereas the word \"gender\" should be used to refer to (cultural differences). However, it is not at all clear the degree to which the differences between males and females are due to biological factors versus learned and cultural factors. Furthermore, indiscriminate use of the word \"gender\" tends to obscure the distinction between two different topics: (a) differences between males and females, and (b) individual differences in maleness and femaleness that occur within each sex.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that more useful distinctions to make would be whether a behavioral difference between the sexes is first due to an evolved adaptation, then, if so, whether the adaptation is sexually dimorphic (different) or sexually monomorphic (the same in both sexes). The term \"sex difference\" could then be re-defined as between-sex differences that are manifestations of a sexually dimorphic adaptation (which is how many scientists use the term), while the term \"gender difference\" could be re-defined as due to differential socialization between the sexes of a monomorphic adaptation or byproduct. For example, greater male propensity toward physical aggression and risk taking would be termed a \"sex difference;\" the generally longer head hair length of females would be termed a \"gender difference.\"\n\nTransgender people experience a mismatch between their gender identity or gender expression, and their assigned sex. Transgender people are sometimes called \"transsexual\" if they desire medical assistance to transition from one sex to another.\n\n\"Transgender\" is also an umbrella term: in addition to including people whose gender identity is the \"opposite\" of their assigned sex (trans men and trans women), it may include people who are not exclusively masculine or feminine (e.g. people who are genderqueer, non-binary, bigender, pangender, genderfluid, or agender). Other definitions of \"transgender\" also include people who belong to a third gender, or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender. Infrequently, the term \"transgender\" is defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.\n\nMany feminists consider sex to only be a matter of biology and something that is not about social or cultural construction. For example, Lynda Birke, a feminist biologist, states that \"'biology' is not seen as something which might change.\" However, the sex/gender distinction, also known as the Standard Model of Sex/Gender, is criticized by feminists who believe that there is undue emphasis placed on sex being a biological aspect, something that is fixed, natural, unchanging, and consisting of a male/female dichotomy. They believe the distinction fails to recognize anything outside the strictly male/female dichotomy and that it creates a barrier between those that fit as 'usual' and those that are 'unusual'. In order to prove that sex is not only limited to two categories Anne Fausto-Sterling's \"Sexing the Body\" addresses the birth of children who are intersex. In this case, the standard model (sex/gender distinction) is seen as incorrect with regard to its notion that there are only two sexes, male and female. This is because \"complete maleness and complete femaleness represent the extreme ends of a spectrum of possible body types.\" In other words, Fausto-Sterling argues that there are multitudes of sexes in between the two extremes of male and female.\n\nRather than viewing sex as a biological construct, there are feminists who accept both sex and gender as a social construct. According to the Intersex Society of North America, \"nature doesn't decide where the category of 'male' ends and the category of 'intersex' begins, or where the category of 'intersex' ends and the category of 'female' begins. Humans decide. Humans (today, typically doctors) decide how small a penis has to be, or how unusual a combination of parts has to be, before it counts as intersex.\" Fausto-Sterling believes that sex is socially constructed because nature does not decide on who is seen as a male or female physically. Rather, doctors decide what seems to be a \"natural\" sex for the inhabitants of society. In addition, the gender, behavior, actions, and appearance of males/females is also seen as socially constructed because codes of femininity and masculinity are chosen and deemed fit by society for societal usage.\n\nSome feminists go further and argue that neither sex nor gender are strictly binary concepts. Judith Lorber, for instance, has stated that many conventional indicators of sex are not sufficient to demarcate male from female. For example, not all women lactate, while some men do. Similarly, Suzanne Kessler, in a 1990 survey of medical specialists in pediatric intersexuality, found out that when a child was born with XY chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia, its sex was often determined according to the size of its penis. Thus, even if the sex/gender distinction holds, Lorber and Kessler suggest that the dichotomies of female/male and masculine/feminine are not themselves exhaustive. Lorber writes, \"My perspective goes beyond accepted feminist views that gender is a cultural overlay that modifies physiological sex differences [...] I am arguing that bodies differ in many ways physiologically, but they are completely transformed by social practices to fit into the salient categories of a society, the most pervasive of which are 'female' and 'male' and 'women' and 'men.'\"\n\nMoreover, Lorber has alleged that there exists more diversity within the individual categories of sex and gender—female/male and feminine/masculine, respectively—than between them. Hence, her fundamental claim is that both sex and gender are social constructions, rather than natural kinds.\n\nA comparable view has been advanced by Linda Zerilli, who writes regarding Monique Wittig, that she is \"critical of the sex/gender dichotomy in much feminist theory because such a dichotomy leaves unquestioned the belief that there is a 'core of nature which resists examination, a relationship excluded from the social in the analysis—a relationship whose characteristic is ineluctability in culture, as well as in nature, and which is the heterosexual relationship.'\" Judith Butler also criticizes the sex/gender distinction. Discussing sex as biological fact causes sex to appear natural and politically neutral. However, she argues that \"the ostensibly natural facts of sex [are] discursively produced in the service of other political and social interests.\" Butler concludes, \"If the immutable character of sex is contested, perhaps this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all.\"\n\n"}

Telugu is a compulsory subject in schools in both states, with fluency in the language being a requirement for matriculation.\n\nThe government in Andhra Pradesh is working to increase the number of English medium schools state schools, with some proposals calling for English to be the only medium of instruction in state schools, claiming that this policy reflects the growing desire of parents and that the state sector is losing pupils due to its inability to meet the increased demand for English medium schools. In Telangana, the government has issued plans to mandate English-medium education in all the private schools in the state. The trend towards English-medium education has caused alarm among some Telugu-language activists who claim that the state governments are placing the language in an inferior position and depriving Telugu-speakers of their language rights. Passions have been further inflamed by anecdotal reports of students in English-language schools being punished for speaking Telugu.\n\nMany educated Telugu people began travelling around the world in search of knowledge-based jobs, and have observed that many countries are prospering faster than India by imparting education in their native languages without depending on English.

{"id": "3446100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3446100", "title": "Unmoved mover", "text": "Unmoved mover\n\nThe unmoved mover () or prime mover () is a concept advanced by Aristotle as a primary cause (or first uncaused cause) or \"mover\" of all the motion in the universe. As is implicit in the name, the \"unmoved mover\" moves other things, but is not itself moved by any prior action. In Book 12 () of his \"Metaphysics\", Aristotle describes the unmoved mover as being perfectly beautiful, indivisible, and contemplating only the perfect contemplation: itself contemplating. He equates this concept also with the active intellect. This Aristotelian concept had its roots in cosmological speculations of the earliest Greek pre-Socratic philosophers and became highly influential and widely drawn upon in medieval philosophy and theology. St. Thomas Aquinas, for example, elaborated on the unmoved mover in the .\n\nAristotle argues, in Book 8 of the \"Physics\" and Book 12 of the \"Metaphysics\", \"that there must be an immortal, unchanging being, ultimately responsible for all wholeness and orderliness in the sensible world\".\n\nIn the \"Physics\" (VIII 4–6) Aristotle finds \"surprising difficulties\" explaining even commonplace change, and in support of his approach of explanation by four causes, he required \"a fair bit of technical machinery\". This \"machinery\" includes potentiality and actuality, hylomorphism, the theory of categories, and \"an audacious and intriguing argument, that the bare existence of change requires the postulation of a first cause, an unmoved mover whose necessary existence underpins the ceaseless activity of the world of motion\". Aristotle's \"first philosophy\", or \"Metaphysics\" (\"\"after\" the Physics\"), develops his peculiar theology of the prime mover, as : an independent divine eternal unchanging immaterial substance.\n\nAristotle adopted the geometrical model of Eudoxus of Cnidus, to provide a general explanation of the apparent wandering of the classical planets arising from uniform circular motions of celestial spheres. While the number of spheres in the model itself was subject to change (47 or 55), Aristotle's account of aether, and of potentiality and actuality, required an individual unmoved mover for each sphere.\n\nDespite their apparent function in the celestial model, the unmoved movers were a final cause, \"not\" an efficient cause for the movement of the spheres; they were solely a constant inspiration, and even if taken for an efficient cause \"precisely\" due to being a final cause, the nature of the explanation is purely teleological.\n\nThe unmoved movers, if they were anywhere, were said to fill the outer void, beyond the sphere of fixed stars:\nThe unmoved movers are, themselves, immaterial substance, (separate and individual beings), having neither parts nor magnitude. As such, it would be physically impossible for them to move material objects of any size by pushing, pulling or collision. Because matter is, for Aristotle, a substratum in which a potential to change can be actualized, any and all potentiality must be actualized in a being that is eternal but it must not be still, because continuous activity is essential for all forms of life. This immaterial form of activity must be intellectual in nature and it cannot be contingent upon sensory perception if it is to remain uniform; therefore eternal substance must think only of thinking itself and exist outside the starry sphere, where even the notion of place is undefined for Aristotle. Their influence on lesser beings is purely the result of an \"aspiration or desire\", and each aetheric celestial sphere emulates one of the unmoved movers, as best it can, by uniform circular motion. The first heaven, the outmost sphere of fixed stars, is moved by a desire to emulate the prime mover (first cause), in relation to whom, the subordinate movers suffer an accidental dependency.\n\nMany of Aristotle's contemporaries complained that oblivious, powerless gods are unsatisfactory. Nonetheless, it was a life which Aristotle enthusiastically endorsed as one most enviable and perfect, the unembellished basis of theology. As the whole of nature depends on the inspiration of the eternal unmoved movers, Aristotle was concerned to establish the metaphysical necessity of the perpetual motions of the heavens. It is through the seasonal action of the Sun upon the terrestrial spheres, that the cycles of generation and corruption give rise to all \"natural\" motion as efficient cause. The intellect, \"nous\", \"or whatever else it be that is thought to rule and lead us by nature, and to have cognizance of what is noble and divine\" is the highest activity, according to Aristotle (contemplation or speculative thinking, \"theōrētikē\"). It is also the most sustainable, pleasant, self-sufficient activity; something which is aimed at for its own sake. (In contrast to politics and warfare, it does not involve doing things we'd rather not do, but rather something we do at our leisure.) This aim is not strictly human, to achieve it means to live in accordance not with mortal thoughts, but something immortal and divine which is within humans. According to Aristotle, contemplation is the only type of happy activity which it would not be ridiculous to imagine the gods having. In Aristotle's psychology and biology, the intellect is the soul, (see also \"eudaimonia\").\n\nIn book VIII of his \"Physics,\" Aristotle examines the notions of change or motion, and attempts to show by a challenging argument, that the mere supposition of a 'before' and an 'after', requires a \"first principle\". He argues that in the beginning, if the cosmos had come to be, its first motion would lack an antecedent state, and as Parmenides said, \"nothing comes from nothing\". The cosmological argument, later attributed to Aristotle, thereby draws the conclusion that God exists. However, if the cosmos had a beginning, Aristotle argued, it would require an efficient first cause, a notion that Aristotle took to demonstrate a critical flaw.\nBut it is a wrong assumption to suppose universally that we have an adequate first principle in virtue of the fact that something always is so … Thus Democritus reduces the causes that explain nature to the fact that things happened in the past in the same way as they happen now: but he does not think fit to seek for a first principle to explain this 'always' … Let this conclude what we have to say in support of our contention that there never was a time when there was not motion, and never will be a time when there will not be motion. (\"Physics\" VIII, 2)\nThe purpose of Aristotle's cosmological argument, that at least one eternal unmoved mover must exist, is to support everyday change.\n\nOf things that exist, substances are the first. But if substances can, then all things can perish... and yet, time and change cannot. Now, the only continuous change is that of place, and the only continuous change of place is circular motion. Therefore, there must be an eternal circular motion and this confirmed by the fixed stars which are moved by the eternal actual substance substance that's purely actual.\nIn Aristotle's estimation, an explanation without the temporal actuality and potentiality of an infinite locomotive chain is required for an eternal cosmos with neither beginning nor end: an unmoved eternal substance for whom the Primum Mobile turns diurnally and whereby all terrestrial cycles are driven: day and night, the seasons of the year, the transformation of the elements, and the nature of plants and animals.\n\nAristotle begins by describing substance, of which he says there are three types: the sensible, which is subdivided into the perishable, which belongs to physics, and the eternal, which belongs to \"another science\". He notes that sensible substance is changeable and that there are several types of change, including quality and quantity, generation and destruction, increase and diminution, alteration, and motion. Change occurs when one given state becomes something contrary to it: that is to say, what exists potentially comes to exist actually. (See Potentiality and actuality.) Therefore, \"a thing [can come to be], incidentally, out of that which is not, [and] also all things come to be out of that which is, but is potentially, and is not actually.\" That by which something is changed is the mover, that which is changed is the matter, and that into which it is changed is the form.\n\nSubstance is necessarily composed of different elements. The proof for this is that there are things which are different from each other and that all things are composed of elements. Since elements combine to form composite substances, and because these substances differ from each other, there must be different elements: in other words, \"b or a cannot be the same as ba\".\n\nNear the end of \"Metaphysics\", Book , Aristotle introduces a surprising question, asking \"whether we have to suppose one such [mover] or more than one, and if the latter, how many\". Aristotle concludes that the number of all the movers equals the number of separate movements, and we can determine these by considering the mathematical science most akin to philosophy, i.e., astronomy. Although the mathematicians differ on the number of movements, Aristotle considers that the number of celestial spheres would be 47 or 55. Nonetheless, he concludes his \"Metaphysics\", Book , with a quotation from the \"Iliad\": \"The rule of many is not good; one ruler let there be.\"\n"}
{"id": "35842043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35842043", "title": "Whataboutism", "text": "Whataboutism\n\nWhataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the \"tu quoque\" logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which in the United States is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Soviet response would often be \"What about...\" followed by an event in the Western world.\n\nThe term \"whataboutery\" has been used in Britain and Ireland since the period of the Troubles (conflict) in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant \"whataboutism\" to the 1990s or 1970s, while other historians state that during the Cold War, Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term. The tactic saw a resurgence in post-Soviet Russia, relating to human rights violations committed by, and criticisms of, the Russian government. The technique received new attention during Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Ukraine. Usage of the tactic extended to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov.\n\n\"The Guardian\" deemed whataboutism, as used in Russia, \"practically a national ideology\". Journalist Julia Ioffe wrote that \"Anyone who has ever studied the Soviet Union\" was aware of the technique, citing the Soviet rejoinder to criticism, \"And you are lynching Negroes\", as a \"classic\" example of the tactic. Writing for \"Bloomberg News\",\nLeonid Bershidsky called whataboutism a \"Russian tradition\", while \"The New Yorker\" described the technique as \"a strategy of false moral equivalences\". Jill Dougherty called whataboutism a \"sacred Russian tactic\", and compared it to \"the pot calling the kettle black\".\n\nThe term \"Whataboutism\" stems from the conjunction of the two words \"what + about\" to twist criticism back on the critic himself.\n\nAccording to Russian journalist Konstantin von Eggert, the term originated in the 1960s as an ironic description of \"the Soviet Union's efforts at countering Western criticism\". The \"Merriam-Webster\" dictionary dates the term back to the Cold War. It references journalist Michael Bernard from \"The Age\", who in 1978 wrote \"the weaknesses of whataboutism—which dictates that no one must get away with an attack on the Kremlin's abuses without tossing a few bricks at South Africa, no one must indict the Cuban police State without castigating President Park, no one must mention Irak, Libya or the PLO without having a bash at Israel\".\n\nThe \"Oxford Dictionary of English\" 2010 edition, and \"Oxford Living Dictionaries\" entry on \"whataboutism\" states: \"Origin - 1990s: from the way in which counter-accusations may take the form of questions introduced by 'What about —?'.\" According to the lexicographer Ben Zimmer, the term \"whataboutism\" appeared \"as early as 1993\". In contrast, Andreas Umland, a political scientist and historian of Russia and Ukraine, said the term was used during the Soviet Union period, writing: \"what was known during Soviet times, as 'whataboutism. Neil Buckley wrote for \"Financial Times\", \"Soviet-watchers called it 'whataboutism'. This was the Communist-era tactic of deflecting foreign criticism of, say, human rights abuses, by pointing, often disingenuously, at something allegedly similar in the critic's own country: 'Ah, but what about…?\n\nAccording to \"Oxford Dictionary of English\", in British English \"whataboutism\" is synonymous with \"whataboutery\", which according to Zimmer has been used with a similar meaning since the period of The Troubles conflict in Northern Ireland. In 1974, a letter published in \"The Irish Times\" referred to \"the Whatabouts ... who answer every condemnation of the Provisional I.R.A. with an argument to prove the greater immorality of the 'enemy and an opinion column in the same paper picked up the theme using the term \"whataboutery\", which gained wide currency in commentary about the conflict. Zimmer noted that the variant \"whataboutism\" was used in the same context in a 1993 book by Tony Parker.\n\nBritish journalist Edward Lucas used the word \"whataboutism\" in a blog post of 29 October 2007, reporting as part of a diary about Russia which was printed in 2 November issue of \"The Economist\". \"Whataboutism\" was the title of an article in \"The Economist\" on 31 January 2008, where Lucas wrote: \"Soviet propagandists during the cold war were trained in a tactic that their western interlocutors nicknamed 'whataboutism. Zimmer credited Lucas for popularizing the term in 2007–2008. Ivan Tsvetkov, associate professor of International Relations in St Petersburg, dates the practice of whataboutism back to 1950 with the \"lynching of blacks\" argument, but he also credits Lucas for the recent popularity of the term. \"The Guardian\" in 2013 described whataboutism as \"practically a national ideology\" of Russia.\n\nWhen criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the response would be \"What about...\" followed by the naming of an event in the West. It represents a case of \"tu quoque\" – an appeal to hypocrisy. The tactic is a type of logical fallacy that attempts to discredit the opponent's position by accusing hypocrisy. It functions as a diversionary tactic to distract the opponent from their original criticism. Thus, the technique is used to avoid directly refuting or disproving the opponent's initial argument. The tactic is an attempt at moral relativism, and a form of false moral equivalence.\n\n\"The Economist\" recommended two methods of properly countering whataboutism: to \"use points made by Russian leaders themselves\" so that they cannot be applied to the West, and for Western nations to engage in more self-criticism of their own media and government. \"Euromaidan Press\" discussed the strategy in a feature on whataboutism, the second in a three-part educational series on Russian propaganda. The series described whataboutism as an intentional distraction away from serious criticism of Russia. The piece advised subjects of whataboutism to resist emotional manipulation and the temptation to respond.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Western officials responding to Soviet propaganda's usage of the tactic referred to it as \"whataboutism\". Due to its frequent use by Soviet officials, the term emerged during the Soviet era. The technique became increasingly prevalent in Soviet public relations, until it became a habitual practice by the government. Soviet media employing whataboutism, hoping to tarnish the reputation of the US, did so at the expense of journalistic neutrality. According to the Ottawa Citizen, Soviet officials made increased use of the tactic during the latter portion of the 1940s, aiming to distract attention from criticism of the Soviet Union.\n\nOne of the earliest uses of the technique was in 1947, after William Averell Harriman criticized \"Soviet imperialism\" in a speech. Ilya Ehrenburg's response in \"Pravda\" criticized the United States' laws and policies on race and minorities, writing that the Soviet Union deemed them \"insulting to human dignity\" but did not use them as a pretext for war. Whataboutism saw greater usage in Soviet public relations during the Cold War.\n\nThroughout the Cold War, the tactic was primarily utilized by media figures speaking on behalf of the Soviet Union. By accusing critics of hypocrisy, the Soviet Union hoped to deflect attention away from the original criticism itself. The term whataboutism was known locally the Soviet Union as a way to draw attention from criticism of Moscow. As the tactic became ubiquitous in the Soviet Union, whataboutism became known as a Soviet cliché. At the end of the Cold War, alongside US civil rights reforms, the tactic began dying out.\n\nThe tactic was used in post-Soviet Russia in relation to human rights violations committed by, and other criticisms of, the Russian government. Whataboutism became a favorite tactic of the Kremlin. Russian public relations strategies combined whataboutism with other Soviet tactics, including \"disinformation\" and \"active measures\". Whataboutism is used as Russian propaganda with the goal of obfuscating criticism of the Russian state, and to degrade the level of discourse from rational criticism of Russia to petty bickering. Russian leaders adopted the Soviet-era practice of whataboutism, choosing to avoid internal reflection of external criticism in favor of emphasizing other states' wrongdoings. In addition to whataboutism, Russian leaders asserted that their actions had been the result of Western provocation, and attempted to distort the veracity of media coverage.\n\nAlthough the use of whataboutism was not restricted to any particular race or belief system, according to \"The Economist\", Russians often overused the tactic. The Russian government's use of whataboutism grew under the leadership of Vladimir Putin. Jake Sullivan of \"Foreign Policy\", wrote Putin \"is an especially skillful practitioner\" of the technique. \"Business Insider\" echoed this assessment, writing that \"Putin's near-default response to criticism of how he runs Russia is whataboutism\". Edward Lucas of \"The Economist\" observed the tactic in modern Russian politics, and cited it as evidence of the Russian leadership's return to a Soviet-era mentality.\n\nWriter Miriam Elder commented in \"The Guardian\" that Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, used the tactic; she added that most criticisms of human rights violations had gone unanswered. Peskov responded to Elder's article on the difficulty of dry-cleaning in Moscow by mentioning Russians' difficulty obtaining a visa to the United Kingdom. Peskov used the whataboutism tactic the same year in a letter written to the \"Financial Times\".\n\nThe tactic received new attention during Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Ukraine. The Russian officials and media frequently used \"what about\" and then provided Kosovo independence or the 2014 Scottish independence referendum as examples to justify Crimean annexation and the Donbass military conflict. Neil Buckley wrote for the \"Financial Times\", \"As several former Soviet republics drift back towards authoritarian ways, whataboutism is making a comeback.\" Jill Dougherty noted in 2014 that the tactic is a \"a time-worn propaganda technique used by the Soviet government\" which sees further use in Russian propaganda, including \"Russia Today\". The assessment that \"Russia Today\" engages in whataboutism was echoed by the \"Financial Times\" and \"Bloomberg News\".\n\nThe tactic was also employed by Azerbaijan, which responded to criticism of its human rights record by holding parliamentary hearings on issues in the United States. Simultaneously, pro-Azerbaijan Internet trolls used whataboutism to draw attention away from criticism of the country. Similarly, Turkey engaged in whataboutism by publishing an official document listing criticisms of other governments that had criticized Turkey. \"The Washington Post\" observed in 2016 that media outlets of Russia had become \"famous\" for their use of whataboutism. Use of the technique had a negative impact on Russia–United States relations during US President Barack Obama's second term. \"The Wall Street Journal\" noted that Putin himself used the tactic in a 2017 interview with NBC News journalist Megyn Kelly.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has been accused of whataboutism in response to criticism leveled at him, his policies, or his support of controversial world leaders. National Public Radio (NPR) reported, \"President Trump has developed a consistent tactic when he's criticized: say that someone else is worse.\" NPR noted Trump chose to criticize the Affordable Care Act when he himself faced criticism over the proposed American Health Care Act of 2017, \"Instead of giving a reasoned defense, he went for blunt offense, which is a hallmark of whataboutism.\" NPR noted similarities in use of the tactic by Putin and Trump, \"it's no less striking that while Putin's Russia is causing the Trump administration so much trouble, Trump nevertheless often sounds an awful lot like Putin\".\n\nWhen criticized or asked to defend his behavior, Trump has frequently changed the subject by criticizing Hillary Clinton, the Obama Administration, and the Affordable Care Act. When asked about Russian human rights violations, Trump has shifted focus to the US itself, employing whataboutism tactics similar to those used by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAfter Fox News host Bill O'Reilly and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough called Putin a killer, Trump responded by saying that the US government was also guilty of killing people. Garry Kasparov commented to \"Columbia Journalism Review\" on Trump's use of whataboutism: \"Moral relativism, 'whataboutism', has always been a favorite weapon of illiberal regimes. For a US president to employ it against his own country is tragic.\"\n\nDuring a news conference on infrastructure at Trump Tower after the 2017 Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, a reporter linked the alt-right to the fatal vehicle-ramming attack that was inflicted against counter-demonstrators, to which Donald Trump responded by demanding the reporter to \"define alt-right to me\" and subsequently interrupting the reporter to ask, \"what about the alt-left that came charging at [the alt-right]?\" Various experts have criticized Trump's usage of the term \"alt-left\" by arguing that no members of the progressive left have used that term to describe themselves and furthermore that Trump fabricated the term to falsely equate the alt-right to the counter-demonstrators.\n\nThe philosopher Merold Westphal said that only people who know themselves to be guilty of something \"can find comfort in finding others to be just as bad or worse.\" Whataboutery, as practiced by both parties in The Troubles in Northern Ireland to highlight what the other side had done to them, was \"one of the commonest forms of evasion of personal moral responsibility,\" according to Bishop (later Cardinal) Cahal Daly. After a political shooting at a baseball game in 2017, journalist Chuck Todd criticized the tenor of political debate, commenting, \"What-about-ism is among the worst instincts of partisans on both sides.\"\n\nWhataboutism usually points the finger at a rival's offenses to discredit them, but, in a reversal of this usual direction, it can also be used to discredit oneself while one refuses to critique an ally. During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, when \"The New York Times\" asked candidate Donald Trump about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's treatment of journalists, teachers, and dissidents, Trump replied with a criticism of U.S. history on civil liberties. Writing for \"The Diplomat\", Catherine Putz pointed out: \"The core problem is that this rhetorical device precludes discussion of issues (ex: civil rights) by one country (ex: the United States) if that state lacks a perfect record.\" Masha Gessen wrote for \"The New York Times\" that usage of the tactic by Trump was shocking to Americans, commenting, \"No American politician in living memory has advanced the idea that the entire world, including the United States, was rotten to the core.\"\n\nJoe Austin was critical of the practice of whataboutism in Northern Ireland in a 1994 piece, \"The Obdurate and the Obstinate\", writing: \"And I'd no time at all for 'What aboutism' ... if you got into it you were defending the indefensible.\" In 2017, \"The New Yorker\" described the tactic as \"a strategy of false moral equivalences\", and Clarence Page called the technique \"a form of logical jiu-jitsu\". Writing for \"National Review\", commentator Ben Shapiro criticized the practice, whether it was used by those espousing right-wing politics or left-wing politics; Shapiro concluded: \"It's all dumb. And it's making us all dumber.\" Michael J. Koplow of Israel Policy Forum wrote that the usage of whataboutism had become a crisis; concluding that the tactic did not yield any benefits, Koplow charged that \"whataboutism from either the right or the left only leads to a black hole of angry recriminations from which nothing will escape\".\n\nIn his book \"The New Cold War\" (2008), Edward Lucas characterized whataboutism as \"the favourite weapon of Soviet propagandists\". Juhan Kivirähk and colleagues called it a \"polittechnological\" strategy. Writing in \"The National Interest\" in 2013, Samuel Charap was critical of the tactic, commenting, \"Russian policy makers, meanwhile, gain little from petulant bouts of 'whataboutism. National security journalist Julia Ioffe commented in a 2014 article, \"Anyone who has ever studied the Soviet Union knows about a phenomenon called 'whataboutism'.\" Ioffe cited the Soviet response to criticism, \"And you are lynching negroes\", as a \"classic\" form of whataboutism. She said that \"Russia Today\" was \"an institution that is dedicated solely to the task of whataboutism\", and concluded that whataboutism was a \"sacred Russian tactic\". Garry Kasparov discussed the Soviet tactic in his book \"Winter Is Coming\", calling it a form of \"Soviet propaganda\" and a way for Russian bureaucrats to \"respond to criticism of Soviet massacres, forced deportations, and gulags\". Mark Adomanis commented for \"The Moscow Times\" in 2015 that \"Whataboutism was employed by the Communist Party with such frequency and shamelessness that a sort of pseudo mythology grew up around it.\" Adomanis observed, \"Any student of Soviet history will recognize parts of the whataboutist canon.\"\n\nWriting in 2016 for \"Bloomberg News\", journalist Leonid Bershidsky called whataboutism a \"Russian tradition\", while \"The National\" called the tactic \"an effective rhetorical weapon\". In their book \"The European Union and Russia\" (2016), Forsberg and Haukkala characterized whataboutism as an \"old Soviet practice\", and they observed that the strategy \"has been gaining in prominence in the Russian attempts at deflecting Western criticism\". In her book, \"Security Threats and Public Perception\", author Elizaveta Gaufman called the whataboutism technique \"A Soviet/Russian spin on liberal anti-Americanism\", comparing it to the Soviet rejoinder, \"And you are lynching negroes\". \"Foreign Policy\" supported this assessment. In 2016, Canadian columnist Terry Glavin asserted in the \"Ottawa Citizen\" that Noam Chomsky used the tactic in an October 2001 speech, delivered after the September 11 attacks, that was critical of US foreign policy. Daphne Skillen discussed the tactic in her book, \"Freedom of Speech in Russia\", identifying it as a \"Soviet propagandist's technique\" and \"a common Soviet-era defence\". In a piece for CNN, Jill Dougherty compared the technique to \"the pot calling the kettle black\". Dougherty wrote: \"There's another attitude ... that many Russians seem to share, what used to be called in the Soviet Union 'whataboutism', in other words, 'who are you to call the kettle black?\n\nRussian journalist Alexey Kovalev told \"GlobalPost\" in 2017 that the tactic was \"an old Soviet trick\". Peter Conradi, author of \"Who Lost Russia?\", called whataboutism \"a form of moral relativism that responds to criticism with the simple response: 'But you do it too. Conradi echoed Gaufman's comparison of the tactic to the Soviet response, \"Over there they lynch Negroes\". Writing for \"Forbes\" in 2017, journalist Melik Kaylan explained the term's increased pervasiveness in referring to Russian propaganda tactics: \"Kremlinologists of recent years call this 'whataboutism' because the Kremlin's various mouthpieces deployed the technique so exhaustively against the U.S.\" Kaylan commented upon a \"suspicious similarity between Kremlin propaganda and Trump propaganda\". \"Foreign Policy\" wrote that Russian whataboutism was \"part of the national psyche\". \"EurasiaNet\" stated that \"Moscow's geopolitical whataboutism skills are unmatched\", while \"Paste\" correlated whataboutism's rise with the increasing societal consumption of fake news.\n\nWriting for \"The Washington Post\", former United States Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul wrote critically of Trump's use of the tactic and compared him to Putin. McFaul commented, \"That's exactly the kind of argument that Russian propagandists have used for years to justify some of Putin's most brutal policies.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" contributor Matt Welch classed the tactic among \"six categories of Trump apologetics\". \"Mother Jones\" called the tactic \"a traditional Russian propaganda strategy\", and observed, \"The whataboutism strategy has made a comeback and evolved in President Vladimir Putin's Russia.\"\n\nSome commentators have defended the usage of whataboutism and \"tu quoque\" in certain contexts. Whataboutism can provide necessary context into whether or not a particular line of critique is relevant or fair. For instance, in international relations, behavior that may be imperfect by international standards may be quite good for a given geopolitical neighborhood, and deserves to be recognized as such.\n\nChristian Christensen, Professor of Journalism in Stockholm, argues that the accusation of whataboutism is itself a form of \"tu quoque\" fallacy, as it dismisses criticisms of one's own behavior to focus instead on the actions of another, thus creating a double standard. Those who use whataboutism are not necessarily engaging in an empty or cynical deflection of responsibility: whataboutism can be a useful tool to expose contradictions, double standards, and hypocrisy.\n\nOthers have criticized the usage of accusations of whataboutism by American news outlets, arguing that the accusation whataboutism has been used to simply deflect any and all criticism of human rights abuses perpetrated by the United States or its allies. They argue that the usage of the term almost exclusively by American outlets is a double standard, and that moral accusations made by powerful countries are merely a pretext to punish their geopolitical rivals in the face of their own wrongdoing. \n\nThe scholars Kristen R. Ghodsee and Scott Sehon posit that mentioning the possible existence of victims of capitalism in popular discourse is often dismissed as 'whataboutism', which they describe as \"a term implying that only atrocities perpetrated by communists merit attention.\" They also argue that such accusations of 'whataboutism' are invalid as the same arguments used against communism can also be used against capitalism.\n\n\n\n\n"}

WILPF has national sections in 37 countries.\n\nThe WILPF is headquartered in Geneva and maintains a United Nations office in New York City.\n\nWILPF developed out of the International Women's Congress against World War I that took place in The Hague, Netherlands, in 1915; the name WILPF was not chosen until 1919. The first WILPF president, Jane Addams, had previously founded the Woman's Peace Party in the United States, in January 1915, this group later became the US section of WILPF. Along with Jane Addams, Marian Cripps and Margaret E. Dungan were also founding members. As of 1920 the US section of WILPF was headquartered in New York City. Marian Cripps, Baroness Parmoor, who later served as president of its British branch.\n\nFurthermore, Women’s international league for peace and freedom opposed to wars and international conflicts. Since it is an undeniable fact that wars will violate individual’s peace and freedom, the league organised and took formal actions to end the war. The major movements of the league are open letter to UN secretary general to formally end the Korean War, International day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons and statement on weapons, gender-based violence and women human rights defenders. As the league is consisted of women, concentrated professionals are allowed to improve the current issues related to women and people. \n\nA forerunner to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Woman's Peace Party (WPP) was formed in January, 1915 in Washington, D.C. at a meeting called by Jane Addams and Carrie Chapman Catt. The approximately 3,000 women attendees approved a platform calling for the extension of suffrage to women and for a conference of neutral countries to offer continuous mediation as a way of ending war.\n\nWPP sent representatives to a subsequent International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom, held in The Hague from April 28–30, 1915.\n\nThe 1915 International Congress of Women was organized by the German feminist Anita Augspurg, Germany's first female jurist, and Lida Gustava Heymann (1868–1943) at the invitation of the Dutch pacifist, feminist and suffragist Aletta Jacobs to protest the war then raging in Europe, and to suggest ways to prevent war in the future. The Congress opened on April 28, wound up on May 1, and was attended by 1,136 participants from both neutral and belligerent nations, adopted much of the platform of WPP and established an International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) with Jane Addams as president. WPP soon became the US Section of ICWPP.\n\nJane Addams met with President Woodrow Wilson and is said to have worked out some common ground on peace. However, at their second international congress, held in Zürich in 1919, ICWPP denounced the final terms of the peace treaty ending World War I as a scheme of revenge of the victors over the vanquished that would sow the seeds of another world war. They decided to make their committee permanent and renamed it the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. WILPF moved its headquarters to Geneva to be near the proposed site of the League of Nations, although WILPF did not endorse empowering that organization to conduct food blockades or to use military pressure to enforce its resolutions. The League called for international disarmament and an end to economic imperialism. The US branch of WILPF grew in recognition and membership during the post-WWI era, despite some attacks on the organisation as \"unpatriotic\" during the First Red Scare. The WILPF supported treaties such as the Washington Naval Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, regarding them as stepping stones to a peaceful world order.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Vera Brittain was the WILPF's Vice-President.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of World War Two, the League also supported measures to provide relief for Europe's Jewish community.\n\nAlthough WIPLF membership is restricted to women, several male peace activists have contributed to WIPLF meetings and publications, including Bart de Ligt and J. D. Bernal.\n\nTwo WILPF leaders have received the Nobel Peace Prize for their peace efforts and international outlook and work with WILPF: Jane Addams, in 1931 and Emily Greene Balch in 1946.\n\nWILPF has had Consultative Status (category B) with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) since 1948 and has Special Consultative Relations with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), as well as special relations with the International Labour Organization (ILO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other organizations and agencies. WILPF has advocates and lobbies for the democratization of the UN, the Security Council and all other UN organizations and agencies; monitors Security Council and General Assembly activities in order to promote reforms; opposes the privatisation and corporatisation of the UN, especially the global compact with corporations; and advocates for the abolition of the Security Council veto.\n\nWILPF envisions a world free of violence, poverty, pollution and dominance. WILPF stands for equality of all people in a world free of racism, sexism and homophobia; the building of a constructive peace through world disarmament; and the changing of government priorities to meet human needs.\n\nBroad areas of concern are:\n\nPeaceWomen is a project of the WILPF, based out of their United Nations office in New York City. Its mission is described on its website as follows:\n\nThe PeaceWomen Project promotes the role of women in preventing conflict, and the equal and full participation of women in all efforts to create and maintain international peace and security. PeaceWomen facilitates monitoring of the UN system, information sharing and the enabling of meaningful dialogue for positive impact on women’s lives in conflict and post-conflict environments. \n\nPeaceWomen's work focuses on six core areas of action to promote its mission:\n\nWILPF's list of members include Jane Addams, Aletta Jacobs, Alice Walker, Coretta Scott King, Madeleine Rees, Cornelia Ramondt-Hirschmann, Selma Meyer, Brandy G. Robinson, Margaret Hills (née Robertson), and Shina Inoue Kan.\n\nWILPF's international records are held at the University of Colorado Boulder. They contain the reports of the congresses.\n\n\n\n"}
