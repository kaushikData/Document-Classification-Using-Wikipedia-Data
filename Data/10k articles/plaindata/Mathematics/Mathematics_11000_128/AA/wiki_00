{"id": "38613492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38613492", "title": "Borel–de Siebenthal theory", "text": "Borel–de Siebenthal theory\n\nIn mathematics, Borel–de Siebenthal theory describes the closed connected subgroups of a compact Lie group that have \"maximal rank\", i.e. contain a maximal torus. It is named after the Swiss mathematicians Armand Borel and Jean de Siebenthal who developed the theory in 1949. Each such subgroup is the identity component of the centralizer of its center. They can be described recursively in terms of the associated root system of the group. The subgroups for which the corresponding homogeneous space has an invariant complex structure correspond to parabolic subgroups in the complexification of the compact Lie group, a reductive algebraic group.\n\nLet \"G\" be connected compact Lie group with maximal torus \"T\". Hopf showed that the centralizer of a torus \"S\" ⊆ \"T\" is a connected closed subgroup containing \"T\", so of \"maximal rank\". Indeed, if \"x\" is in C(\"S\"), there is a maximal torus containing both \"S\" and \"x\" and it is contained in C(\"S\").\n\nBorel and de Siebenthal proved that the connected closed subgroups of maximal rank are precisely the identity components of the centralizers of their centers.\n\nTheir result relies on a fact from representation theory. The weights of an irreducible representation of a connected compact semisimple group \"K\" with highest weight λ can be easily described (without their multiplicities): they are precisely the saturation under the Weyl group of the dominant weights obtained by subtracting off a sum of simple roots from λ. In particular, if the irreducible representation is trivial on the center of \"K\" (a finite abelian group), 0 is a weight.\n\nTo prove the characterization of Borel and de Siebenthal, let \"H\" be a closed connected subgroup of \"G\" containing \"T\" with center \"Z\". The identity component \"L\" of C(Z) contains \"H\". If it were strictly larger, the restriction of the adjoint representation of \"L\" to \"H\" would be trivial on \"Z\". Any irreducible summand, orthogonal to the Lie algebra of \"H\", would provide non-zero weight zero vectors for \"T\" / \"Z\" ⊆ \"H\" / \"Z\", contradicting the maximality of the torus \"T\" / \"Z\" in \"L\" / \"Z\".\n\nBorel and de Siebenthal classified the maximal closed connected subgroups of maximal rank of a connected compact Lie group.\n\nThe general classification of connected closed subgroups of maximal rank can be reduced to this case, because any connected subgroup of maximal rank is contained in a finite chain of such subgroups, each maximal in the next one. Maximal subgroups are the identity components of any element of their center not belonging to the center of the whole group.\n\nThe problem of determining the maximal connected subgroups of maximal rank can be further reduced to the case where the compact Lie group is simple. In fact the Lie algebra formula_1 of a connected compact Lie group \"G\" splits as a direct sum of the ideals\n\nwhere formula_3 is the center and the other factors formula_4 are simple. If \"T\" is a maximal torus, its Lie algebra formula_5 has a corresponding splitting\n\nwhere formula_7 is maximal abelian in formula_4. If \"H\" is a closed connected of \"G\" containing \"T\" with Lie algebra formula_9, the complexification of formula_9 is the direct sum of the complexification of formula_5 and a number of one-dimensional weight spaces, each of which lies in the complexification of a factor formula_4. Thus if\n\nthen\n\nIf \"H\" is maximal, all but one of the formula_15's coincide with formula_4 and the remaining one is maximal and of maximal rank. For that factor, the closed connected subgroup of the corresponding simply connected simple compact Lie group is maximal and of maximal rank.\n\nLet \"G\" be a connected simply connected compact simple Lie group with maximal torus \"T\". Let formula_1 be the Lie algebra of \"G\" and formula_5 that of \"T\". Let Δ be the corresponding root system. Choose a set of positive roots and corresponding simple roots α, ..., α. Let α the highest root in formula_19 and write\n\nwith \"m\" ≥ 1. (The number of \"m\" equal to 1 is equal to |\"Z\"| – 1, where \"Z\" is the center of \"G\".)\n\nThe \"Weyl alcove\" is defined by\n\nÉlie Cartan shouwed that it is a fundamental domain for the affine Weyl group. If \"G\" = \"G\" / \"Z\" and \"T\" = \"T\" / \"Z\", it follows that the exponential mapping from formula_1 to \"G\" carries 2π\"A\" onto \"T\".\n\nThe Weyl alcove \"A\" is a simplex with vertices at\n\nwhere α(\"X\") = δ.\n\nThe main result of Borel and de Siebenthal is as follows.\n\nThe structure of the corresponding subgroup \"H\" can be described in both cases. It is semisimple in the second case with a system of simple roots obtained by replacing α by −α. In the first case it is the direct product of the circle group generated by \"X\" and a semisimple compact group with a system of simple roots obtained by omitting α.\n\nThis result can be rephrased in terms of the extended Dynkin diagram of formula_1 which adds an extra node for the highest root as well as the labels \"m\". The maximal subalgebras formula_9 of maximal rank are either non-semisimple or semimsimple. The non-semisimple ones are obtained by deleting two nodes from the extended diagram with coefficient one. The corresponding unlabelled diagram gives the Dynkin diagram semisimple part of formula_9, the other part being a one-dimensional factor. The Dynkin diagrams for the semisimple ones are obtained by removing one node with coefficient a prime. This leads to the following possibilities:\n\n\nAll the corresponding homogeneous spaces are symmetric, since the subalgebra is the fixed point algebra of an inner automorphism of period 2, apart from G/A, F/A×A, E/A×A×A, E/A×A and all the E spaces other than E/D and E/E×A. In all these exceptional cases the subalgebra is the fixed point algebra of an inner automorphism of period 3, except for E/A×A where the automorphism has period 5. The homogeneous spaces are then called weakly symmetric spaces.\n\nTo prove the theorem, note that \"H\" is the identity component of the centralizer of an element exp \"T\" with \"T\" in 2π \"A\". Stabilizers increase in moving from a subsimplex to an edge or vertex, so \"T\" either lies on an edge or is a vertex. If it lies on an edge than that edge connects 0 to a vertex \"v\" with \"m\" = 1, which is the first case. If \"T\" is a vertex \"v\" and \"m\" has a non-trivial factor \"m\", then \"mT\" has a larger stabilizer than \"T\", contradicting maximality. So \"m\" must be prime. Maximality can be checked directly using the fact that an intermediate subgroup \"K\" would have the same form, so that its center would be either (a) T or (b) an element of prime order. If the center of \"H\" is 'T, each simple root with \"m\" prime is already a root of \"K\", so (b) is not possible; and if (a) holds, α is the only root that could be omitted with \"m\" = 1, so \"K\" = \"H\". If the center of \"H\" is of prime order, α is a root of \"K\" for \"m\" = 1, so that (a) is not possible; if (b) holds, then the only possible omitted simple root is α, so that \"K\" = \"H\".\n\nA subset Δ ⊂ Δ is called a closed subsystem if whenever α and β lie in Δ with α + β in Δ, then α + β lies in Δ. Two subsystems Δ and Δ are said to be \"equivalent\" if σ( Δ) = Δ for some σ in \"W\" = \"N\"(\"T\") / \"T\", the Weyl group. Thus for a closed subsystem\n\nis a subalgebra of formula_19 containing formula_29; and conversely any such subalgebra gives rise to a closed subsystem. Borel and de Siebenthal classified the maximal closed subsystems up to equivalence.\n\nThis result is a consequence of the Borel–de Siebenthal theorem for maximal connected subgroups of maximal rank. It can also be proved directly within the theory of root systems and reflection groups.\n\nLet \"G\" be a connected compact semisimple Lie group, σ an automorphism of \"G\" of period 2 and \"G\" the fixed point subgroup of σ. Let \"K\" be a closed subgroup of \"G\" lying between \"G\" and its identity component. The compact homogeneous space \"G\" / \"K\" is called a symmetric space of compact type. The Lie algebra formula_1 admits a decomposition\n\nwhere formula_32, the Lie algebra of \"K\", is the +1 eigenspace of σ and formula_33 the –1 eigenspace.\nIf formula_32 contains no simple summand of formula_1, the pair (formula_1, σ) is called an orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra of \"compact type\".\n\nAny inner product on formula_1, invariant under the adjoint representation and σ, induces a Riemannian structure on \"G\" / \"K\", with \"G\" acting by isometries. Under such an inner product, formula_32 and formula_33 are orthogonal. \"G\" / \"K\" is then a Riemannian symmetric space of compact type.\n\nThe symmetric space or the pair (formula_1, σ) is said to be \"irreducible\" if the adjoint action of formula_32 (or equivalently the identity component of \"G\" or \"K\") is irreducible on formula_33. This is equivalent to the maximality of formula_32 as a subalgebra.\n\nIn fact there is a one-one correspondence between intermediate subalgebras formula_9 and \"K\"-invariant subspaces \nformula_45 of formula_33 given by\n\nAny orthogonal symmetric algebra (formula_1, σ) can be decomposed as an (orthogonal) direct sum of irreducible orthogonal symmetric algebras.\n\nIn fact formula_1 can be written as a direct sum of simple algebras\n\nwhich are permuted by the automorphism σ. If σ leaves an algebra formula_51 invariant, its eigenspace decomposition coincides with its intersections with formula_32 and formula_33. So the restriction of σ to formula_51 is irreducible. If σ interchanges two simple summands, the corresponding pair is isomorphic to a diagonal inclusion of \"K\" in \"K\" × \"K\", with \"K\" simple, so is also irreducible. The involution σ just swaps the two factors\nσ(\"x\",\"y\")=(\"y\",\"x\").\n\nThis decomposition of an orthogonal symmetric algebra yields a direct product decomposition of the corresponding compact symmetric space \"G\" / \"K\" when \"G\" is simply connected. In this case the fixed point subgroup \"G\" is automatically connected (this is no longer true, even for inner involutions, if \"G\" is not simply connected). For simply connected \"G\", the symmetric space \"G\" / \"K\" is the direct product of the two kinds of symmetric spaces \"G\" / \"K\" or \"H\" × \"H\" / \"H\". Non-simply connected symmetric space of compact type arise as\nquotients of the sinply connected space \"G\" / \"K\" by finite abelian groups. In fact if\n\nlet\n\nand let Δ be the subgroup of Γ fixed by all automorphisms of \"G\" preserving \"K\" (i.e. automorphisms of the orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra). Then\n\nis a finite abelian group acting freely on \"G\" / \"K\". The non-simply connected symmetric spaces arise as quotients by subgroups of Δ. The subgroup can be identified with the fundamental group, which is thus a finite abelian group.\n\nThe classification of compact symmetric spaces or pairs (formula_1, σ) thus reduces to the case where \"G\" is a connected simple compact Lie group. There are two possibilities: either the automorphism σ is inner, in which case \"K\" has maximal rank and the theory of Borel and de Siebenthal applies; or the automorphism σ is outer, so that, because σ preserves a maximal torus, the rank of \"K\" is less than the rank of \"G\" and σ corresponds to an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram modulo inner automorphisms. determines directly all possible σ in the latter case: they correspond to the symmetric spaces\nSU(\"n\")/SO(\"n\"), SO(\"a\"+\"b\")/SO(\"a\")×SO(\"b\") (\"a\" and \"b\" odd), E/F and E/C.\n\nVictor Kac noticed that all finite order automorphisms of a simple Lie algebra can be determined using the corresponding affine Lie algebra: that classification, which leads to an alternative method of classifying pairs (formula_1, σ), is described in .\n\nThe equal rank case with \"K\" non-semisimple corresponds exactly to the Hermitian symmetric spaces \"G\" / \"K\" of compact type.\n\nIn fact the symmetric space has an almost complex structure preserving the Riemannian metric if and only if there is a linear map \"J\" with \"J\" = −\"I\" on formula_33 which preserves the inner product and commutes with the action of \"K\". In this case \"J\" lies in formula_32 and exp \"Jt\" forms a one-parameter group in the center of \"K\". This follows because if \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\" lie in formula_33, then by the invariance of the inner product on formula_1\n\nReplacing \"A\" and \"B\" by \"JA\" and \"JB\", it follows that\n\nDefine a linear map δ on formula_1 by extending \"J\" to be 0 on formula_32. The last relation shows that δ is a derivation of formula_1. Since formula_1 is semisimple, δ must be an inner derivation, so that\n\nwith \"T\" in formula_32 and \"A\" in formula_33. Taking \"X\" in formula_32, it follows that \"A\" = 0 and \"T\" lies in the center of formula_32 and hence that \"K\" is non-semisimple.\nIf on the other hand \"G\" / \"K\" is irreducible with \"K\" non-semisimple, the compact group \"G\" must be simple and \"K\" of maximal rank. From the theorem of Borel and de Siebenthal, the involution σ is inner and \"K\" is the centralizer of a torus \"S\". It follows that \"G\" / \"K\" is simply connected and there is a [[parabolic subgroup]] \"P\" in the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] \"G\" of \"G\" such that \"G\" / \"K\" = \"G\" / \"P\". In particular there is a complex structure on \"G\" / \"K\" and the action of \"G\" is holomorphic.\n\nIn general any compact hermitian symmetric space is simply connected and can be written as a direct product of irreducible hermitian symmetric spaces \"G\" / \"K\" with \"G\" simple. The irreducible ones are exactly the non-semisimple cases described above.\n\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]\n[[Category:Algebraic groups]]\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Representation theory]]"}

{"id": "690759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=690759", "title": "Differential analyser", "text": "Differential analyser\n\nThe differential analyser is a mechanical analogue computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, using wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. It was one of the first advanced computing devices to be used operationally.\nThe original machines could not add, but then it was noticed that if the two wheels of a rear differential are turned, the drive shaft will compute the average of the left and right wheels. A simple gear ratio of 1:2 then enables multiplication by two, so addition (and subtraction) are achieved. Multiplication is just a special case of integration, namely integrating a constant function.\n\nResearch on solutions for differential equations using mechanical devices, discounting planimeters, started at least as early as 1836, when the French physicist Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis designed a mechanical device to integrate differential equations of the first order.\n\nThe first description of a device which could integrate differential equations of any order was published in 1876 by James Thomson, who was born in Belfast in 1822, but lived in Scotland from the age of 10. Though Thomson called his device an \"integrating machine\", it is his description of the device, together with the additional publication in 1876 of two further descriptions by his younger brother, Lord Kelvin, which represents the invention of the differential analyser.\n\nOne of the earliest practical uses of Thomson's concepts was a tide-predicting machine built by Kelvin starting in 1872-3. On Lord Kelvin's advice, Thomson's integrating machine was later incorporated into a fire-control system for naval gunnery being developed by Arthur Pollen, resulting in an electrically driven, mechanical analogue computer, which was completed by about 1912. Italian mathematician Ernesto Pascal also developed integraphs for the mechanical integration of differential equations and published details in 1914.\n\nHowever, the first widely practical general purpose differential analyser was constructed by Harold Locke Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT, 1928–1931, comprising six mechanical integrators. In the same year, Bush described this machine in a journal article as a \"continuous integraph\". When he published a further article on the device in 1931, he called it a \"differential analyzer\". In this article, Bush stated that \"[the] present device incorporates the same basic idea of interconnection of integrating units as did [Lord Kelvin's]. In detail, however, there is little resemblance to the earlier model.\" According to his 1970 autobiography, Bush was \"unaware of Kelvin’s work until after the first differential analyzer was operational.\" Claude Shannon was hired as a research assistant in 1936 to run the differential analyzer in Bush's lab.\n\nDouglas Hartree of Manchester University brought Bush's design to England, where he constructed his first \"proof of concept\" model with his student, Arthur Porter, during 1934: as a result of this, the university acquired a full scale machine incorporating four mechanical integrators in March 1935, which was built by Metropolitan-Vickers, and was, according to Hartree, \"[the] first machine of its kind in operation outside the United States\". During the next five years three more were added, at Cambridge University, Queen's University Belfast, and the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough. One of the integrators from this proof of concept is on display in the History of Computing section of the Science Museum (London) alongside a complete Manchester machine.\n\nIn Norway, the locally built Oslo Analyser was finished during 1938, based on the same principles as the MIT machine. This machine had 12 integrators, and was the largest analyser built for a period of four years.\n\nIn the United States, further differential analysers were built at the Ballistic Research Laboratory in Maryland and in the basement of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania during the early 1940s. The latter was used extensively in the computation of artillery firing tables prior to the invention of the ENIAC, which, in many ways, was modelled on the differential analyser. Also in the early 1940s, with Samuel H. Caldwell, one of the initial contributors during the early 1930s, Bush attempted an electrical, rather than mechanical, variation, but the digital computer built elsewhere had much greater promise and the project ceased. In 1947, UCLA installed a differential analyser built for them by General Electric at a cost of $125,000. By 1950, this machine had been joined by three more. The UCLA differential analyzer appeared in 1951's When Worlds Collide, where it was called, euphemistically, \"DA\". \nAt Osaka Imperial University (present-day Osaka University) around 1944, \na complete differential analyser machine was developed (illustrated) to calculate the movement of an object and other problems with mechanical components, and then draws graphs on paper with a pen. It was later transferred to the Tokyo University of Science and has been displayed at the school’s Museum of Science in Shinjuku Ward. Restored in 2014 is one of only two still operational differential analyzers produced before the end of World War II.\n\nIn Canada, a differential analyser was constructed at the University of Toronto in 1948 by Beatrice Helen Worsley, but it appears to have had little or no use.\n\nA differential analyser may have been used in the development of the bouncing bomb, used to attack German hydroelectric dams during World War II. Differential analysers have also been used in the calculation of soil erosion by river control authorities.\n\nThe differential analyser was eventually rendered obsolete by electronic analogue computers and, later, digital computers.\n\nThe model differential analyser built at Manchester University in 1934 by Douglas Hartree and Arthur Porter made extensive use of Meccano parts: this meant that the machine was less costly to build, and it proved \"accurate enough for the solution of many scientific problems\". A similar machine built by J.B. Bratt at Cambridge University in 1935 is now in the Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT) collection in Auckland, New Zealand. A memorandum written for the British military's Armament Research Department in 1944 describes how this machine had been modified during World War II for improved reliability and enhanced capability, and identifies its wartime applications as including research on the flow of heat, explosive detonations, and simulations of transmission lines. \nIn 1948, this machine was bought by Professor Harry Whale of Auckland, for 100 pounds sterling, and he then took it to Auckland for use at the Seagrave Radio Research Centre.\n\nIt is estimated that \"about 15 Meccano model Differential Analysers were built for serious work by scientists and researchers around the world\". More recently, building differential analysers with Meccano parts has become a popular project among serious Meccano hobbyists. An example is the differential analyser built at Marshall University, which is now used for educational purposes, in that a student not only solves a differential equation but also becomes the \"calculator\" by operating the machine, and so develops a better understanding of what a differential equation is.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term can mean\n\n\nSome kinds of figurate number were discussed in the 16th and 17th centuries under the name \"figural number\".\n\nIn historical works about Greek mathematics the preferred term used to be \"figured number\".\n\nIn a use going back to Jakob Bernoulli's Ars Conjectandi, the term \"figurate number\" is used for triangular numbers made up of successive integers, tetrahedral numbers made up of successive triangular numbers, etc. These turn out to be the binomial coefficients. In this usage the square numbers 4, 9, 16, 25 would not be considered figurate numbers when viewed as arranged in a square.\n\nA number of other sources use the term \"figurate number\" as synonymous for the polygonal numbers, either just the usual kind or both those and the centered polygonal numbers.\n\nThe mathematical study of figurate numbers is said to have originated with Pythagoras, possibly based on Babylonian or Egyptian precursors. Generating whichever class of figurate numbers the Pythagoreans studied using gnomons is also attributed to Pythagoras. Unfortunately, there is no trustworthy source for these claims, because all surviving writings about the Pythagoreans are from centuries later. It seems to be certain that the fourth triangular number of ten objects, called tetractys in Greek, was a central part of the Pythagorean religion, along with several other figures also called tetractys. Figurate numbers were a concern of Pythagorean geometry.\n\nThe modern study of figurate numbers goes back to Fermat, specifically the Fermat polygonal number theorem. Later, it became a significant topic for Euler, who gave an explicit formula for all triangular numbers that are also perfect squares, among many other discoveries relating to figurate numbers.\n\nFigurate numbers have played a significant role in modern recreational mathematics. In research mathematics, figurate numbers are studied by way of the Ehrhart polynomials, polynomials that count the number of integer points in a polygon or polyhedron when it is expanded by a given factor.\n\nThe triangular numbers for n = 1, 2, 3, ... are the result of the juxtaposition of the linear numbers (linear gnomons) for n = 1, 2, 3, ...:\nThese are the binomial coefficients formula_1. This is the case \"r\"=2 of the fact that the \"r\"th diagonal of Pascal's triangle for formula_2 consists of the figurate numbers for the \"r\"-dimensional analogs of triangles (\"r\"-dimensional simplices).\n\nThe simplicial polytopic numbers for r = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are:\nformula_7\n\nThe terms \"square number\" and \"cubic number\" derive from their geometric representation as a square or cube. The difference of two positive triangular numbers is a trapezoidal number.\n\nThe gnomon is the piece added to a figurate number to transform it to the next larger one.\n\nFor example, the gnomon of the square number is the odd number, of the general form 2\"n\" + 1, \"n\" = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... . The square of size 8 composed of gnomons looks like this:\n8   8   8   8   8   8   8   8\n8   7   7   7   7   7   7   7\n8   7   6   6   6   6   6   6\n8   7   6   5   5   5   5   5\n8   7   6   5   4   4   4   4\n8   7   6   5   4   3   3   3\n8   7   6   5   4   3   2   2\n8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1\n\nTo transform from the \"n-square\" (the square of size \"n\") to the (\"n\" + 1)-square, one adjoins 2\"n\" + 1 elements: one to the end of each row (\"n\" elements), one to the end of each column (\"n\" elements), and a single one to the corner. For example, when transforming the 7-square to the 8-square, we add 15 elements; these adjunctions are the 8s in the above figure.\n\nThis gnomonic technique also provides a mathematical proof that the sum of the first \"n\" odd numbers is \"n\"; the figure illustrates 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64 = 8.\n\n"}

For instance, the classification of finite simple groups was one of the major breakthroughs of 20th century mathematics, its proof spanning thousands of journal pages. On the other hand, it has been known since 1907 that any finite simple ring is isomorphic to the ring formula_1 of \"n\"-by-\"n\" matrices over a finite field of order \"q\" (as a consequence of Wedderburn's theorems, described below).\n\nThe number of rings with \"m\" elements, for \"m\" a natural number, is listed under in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.\n\nThe theory of finite fields is perhaps the most important aspect of finite ring theory due to its intimate connections with algebraic geometry, Galois theory and number theory. An important, but fairly old aspect of the theory is the classification of finite fields :\n\n\nDespite the classification, finite fields are still an active area of research, including recent results on the Kakeya conjecture and open problems regarding the size of smallest primitive roots (in number theory).\n\nA finite field \"F\" may be used to build a vector space of n-dimensions over \"F\". The matrix ring \"A\" of \"n\" × \"n\" matrices with elements from \"F\" is used in Galois geometry, with the projective linear group serving as the multiplicative group of \"A\".\n\nWedderburn's little theorem asserts that any finite division ring is necessarily commutative:\n\nNathan Jacobson later discovered yet another condition which guarantees commutativity of a ring: if for every element \"r\" of \"R\" there exists an integer such that , then \"R\" is commutative. More general conditions which guarantee commutativity of a ring are also known.\n\nYet another theorem by Wedderburn has, as its consequence, a result demonstrating that the theory of finite simple rings is relatively straightforward in nature. More specifically, any finite simple ring is isomorphic to the ring formula_1 of \"n\" by \"n\" matrices over a finite field of order \"q\". This follows from two theorems of Joseph Wedderburn established in 1905 and 1907 (one of which is Wedderburn's little theorem). On the other hand, the classification of finite simple groups was one of the major breakthroughs of twentieth century mathematics, its proof spanning thousands of journal pages. Therefore, in some respects, the theory of finite rings is simpler than that of finite groups.\n\n(Warning: the enumerations in this section include rings that do not necessarily have a multiplicative identity, sometimes called rngs.) In 1964 David Singmaster proposed the following problem in the American Mathematical Monthly: \"(1) What is the order of the smallest non-trivial ring with identity which is not a field? Find two such rings with this minimal order. Are there more? (2) How many rings of order four are there?\"\nOne can find the solution by D.M. Bloom in a two-page proof that there are eleven rings of order 4, four of which have a multiplicative identity. Indeed, four-element rings introduce the complexity of the subject. There are three rings over the cyclic group C and eight rings over the Klein four-group. There is an interesting display of the discriminatory tools (nilpotents, zero-divisors, idempotents, and left- and right-identities) in Gregory Dresden's lecture notes.\n\nThe occurrence of \"non-commutativity\" in finite rings was described in in two theorems: If the order m of a finite ring with 1 has a cube-free factorization, then it is commutative. And if a non-commutative finite ring with 1 has the order of a prime cubed, then the ring is isomorphic to the upper triangular 2 × 2 matrix ring over the Galois field of the prime.\nThe study of rings of order the cube of a prime was further developed in and . Next Flor and Wessenbauer (1975) made improvements on the cube-of-a-prime case. Definitive work on the isomorphism classes came with proving that for \"p\" > 2, the number of classes is 3\"p\" + 50.\n\nThere are earlier references in the topic of finite rings, such as Robert Ballieu and Scorza.\n\nThese are a few of the facts that are known about the number of finite rings (not necessarily with unity) of a given order (suppose \"p\" and \"q\" represent distinct prime numbers):\n\nThe number of rings with \"n\" elements are (with )\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37096", "title": "Floating-point unit", "text": "Floating-point unit\n\nA floating-point unit (FPU, colloquially a math coprocessor) is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating point numbers. Typical operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, and bitshifting. Some systems (particularly older, microcode-based architectures) can also perform various transcendental functions such as exponential or trigonometric calculations, though in most modern processors these are done with software library routines.\n\nIn general purpose computer architectures, one or more FPUs may be integrated as execution units within the central processing unit; however many embedded processors do not have hardware support for floating-point operations (while they increasingly have them as standard, at least 32-bit ones).\n\nWhen a CPU is executing a program that calls for a floating-point operation, there are three ways to carry it out:\n\n\nHistorically systems implemented floating point via a coprocessor rather than as an integrated unit (but now in addition to the CPU, e.g. GPUs that are coprocessors not always built into the CPU have FPUs as a rule, while first generations of GPUs didn't). This could be a single integrated circuit, an entire circuit board or a cabinet. Where floating-point calculation hardware has not been provided, floating point calculations are done in software, which takes more processor time but which avoids the cost of the extra hardware. For a particular computer architecture, the floating point unit instructions may be emulated by a library of software functions; this may permit the same object code to run on systems with or without floating point hardware. Emulation can be implemented on any of several levels: in the CPU as microcode (not a common practice), as an operating system function, or in user space code. When only integer functionality is available the CORDIC floating point emulation methods are most commonly used.\n\nIn most modern computer architectures, there is some division of floating-point operations from integer operations. This division varies significantly by architecture; some, like the Intel x86 have dedicated floating-point registers, while some take it as far as independent clocking schemes.\n\nCORDIC routines has been implemented in the Intel 8087, 80287, 80387 up to the 80486 coprocessor series as well as in the Motorola 68881 and 68882 for some kinds of floating-point instructions, mainly as a way to reduce the gate counts (and complexity) of the FPU sub-system.\n\nFloating-point operations are often pipelined. In earlier superscalar architectures without general out-of-order execution, floating-point operations were sometimes pipelined separately from integer operations.\n\nSince the early 1990s, many microprocessors for desktops and servers have more than one FPU.\n\nThe modular architecture of Bulldozer microarchitecture uses a special FPU named FlexFPU, which uses simultaneous multithreading. Each physical integer core, two per module, is single threaded, in contrast with Intel's Hyperthreading, where two virtual simultaneous threads share the resources of a single physical core.\n\nSome floating-point hardware only supports the simplest operations addition, subtraction, and multiplication. But even the most complex floating-point hardware has a finite number of operations it can support for example, none of them directly support arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n\nWhen a CPU is executing a program that calls for a floating-point operation that is not directly supported by the hardware, the CPU uses a series of simpler floating-point operations. In systems without any floating-point hardware, the CPU emulates it using a series of simpler fixed-point arithmetic operations that run on the integer arithmetic logic unit.\n\nThe software that lists the necessary series of operations to emulate floating-point operations is often packaged in a floating-point library.\n\nIn some cases, FPUs may be specialized, and divided between simpler floating-point operations (mainly addition and multiplication) and more complicated operations, like division. In some cases, only the simple operations may be implemented in hardware or microcode, while the more complex operations are implemented as software.\n\nIn some current architectures, the FPU functionality is combined with units to perform SIMD computation; an example of this is the augmentation of the x87 instructions set with SSE instruction set in the x86-64 architecture used in newer Intel and AMD processors.\n\nIn the 1980s, it was common in IBM PC/compatible microcomputers for the FPU to be entirely separate from the CPU, and typically sold as an optional add-on. It would only be purchased if needed to speed up or enable math-intensive programs.\n\nThe IBM PC, XT, and most compatibles based on the 8088 or 8086 had a socket for the optional 8087 coprocessor. The AT and 80286-based systems were generally socketed for the 80287, and 80386/80386SX based machines for the 80387 and 80387SX respectively, although early ones were socketed for the 80287, since the 80387 did not exist yet. Other companies manufactured co-processors for the Intel x86 series. These included Cyrix and Weitek.\n\nCoprocessors were available for the Motorola 68000 family, the 68881 and 68882. These were common in Motorola 68020/68030-based workstations like the Sun 3 series. They were also commonly added to higher-end models of Apple Macintosh and Commodore Amiga series, but unlike IBM PC-compatible systems, sockets for adding the coprocessor were not as common in lower end systems.\n\nThere are also add-on FPUs coprocessor units for microcontroller units (MCUs/µCs)/single-board computer (SBCs), which serve to provide floating-point arithmetic capability. These add-on FPUs are host-processor-independent, possess their own programming requirements (operations, instruction sets, etc.) and are often provided with their own integrated development environments (IDEs).\n\n"}

He studied mathematics, physics and philosophy in Erlangen and Stuttgart and was scientific advisor at the SEMIOSIS, International Journal of semiotics and aesthetics. In 1977, he was appointed Honorary Professor of Applied computer science at the University of Erlangen Nees is one of the \"3N\" computer pioneers, an abbreviation that has become acknowledged for Frieder Nake, Georg Nees and A. Michael Noll, whose computer graphics were created with digital computers.\n\nGeorge Nees was born in 1926 in Nuremberg, where he spent his childhood. He showed scientific curiosity and interest in art from a young age and among his favorite pastimes were viewing art postcards and looking through a microscope. He attended a school in Schwabach near Nuremberg, graduating in 1945. From 1945 to 1951, he studied mathematics and physics at the University of Erlangen then worked as an industry mathematician for the Siemens Schuckertwerk in Erlangen from 1951 to 1985. There he started to write his first programs in 1959. The company was later incorporated into the Siemens AG.\n\nFrom 1964 onwards, he studied philosophy at the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart (since 1967 the University of Stuttgart), under Max Bense. He received his doctorate with his thesis on Generative Computergraphik under Max Bense in 1969. His work is considered one of the first theses on Generative Computer Graphics. In 1969, his thesis was published as a book entitled \"Generative Computergraphik\" and also included examples of program code and graphics produced thereby. After his retirement in 1985 Nees worked as an author and in the field of computer art.\n\nIn February 1965, Nees showed - as works of art - the world's first computer graphics created with a digital computer. The exhibition, titled \"computer graphik\" took place at the public premises of the \"Study Gallery of Stuttgart College\". In 1966, he started to work on \"computer-sculptures\". In the catalog of the Biennale 1969 Nuremberg, Nees describes how the computer program controlled the milling machine so that instead of a workpiece, a sculpture was created. Three painted wooden sculptures and several graphics were shown at the Biennale 1969 Nuremberg. In 1970 at the 35th Venice Biennale his work was part of the special exhibition \"Research and Design. Proposals for an experimental exposure\" and showcased his sculptures and graphics of art and architectural design.\nIn 1963, Nees was instrumental in the purchase of a flatbed plotter, the Zuse Graphomat Z64 designed by Konrad Zuse, for the data center at the Schuckertwerke in Erlangen. At the exhibition \"Georg Nees – The Great Temptation\" at the ZKM Nees said: ″There it was, the great temptation for me, for once not to represent something technical with this machine but rather something ‘useless’ – geometrical patterns.″\n\nUsing the ALGOL language, Nees created drawings and graphics for production, art and architectural drawings. He wrote the new graphics libraries G1, G2 and G3 with ALGOL, for controlling the Z64 and random number generation. In 1965 Nees experimented with random numbers and circle arcs (\"Kreisbögen\"). The graphic \"Kreisbogengewirre\" (Arc confusion) was a graphic of this series, also known as \"Locken\". Frieder Nake explains how this graphic was created: ″In fact, the picture does consist of one continuous path of arcs. … The length and radius of the individual arcs are randomly chosen within the limits defined by the programmer … The picture in it present form is due to a fairly serious programming error … It was designed to be less complex and it had to be ended manually because of the error.″\n\nNees worked with the \"Siemens System 2002\" to create aesthetic graphics, such as the graphic ″gravel ″ (\"Schotter\") in 1968. This artwork is well known and can be seen on the website of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. When writing the program Nees introduced commands for random numbers, which produced from a designated point on the resulting chaos. This causes the graphic to develop from order to disorder or vice versa, if the graphic is turned through 180 degrees (upside down).\n\nRobert J. Krawczyk wrote in his text \"A Shattered Perfection\": Crafting a Virtual Sculpture: ″Georg Nees’s Gravel Stones … What attracted me to this piece was the simplicity of the concept and the overall interpretation of transforming order into disorder. … What intrigues me with this \"ancient\" piece was the use of exact mathematical computations to model a chaotic image and the progression from the ordered to the disordered.″\n\nThe first computer graphic produced in architecture by Nees was the motive \"corridor\" (\"Flur\") in 1968. In 1968 started his collaboration with the architect Ludwig Rase for the Siemens Pavilion at the Hannover Industrial Fair in 1970. The drawings of the truss roof was first calculated with the System 2002 and drawn with the Graphomat Z64. For the Hannover fair in 1970 the drawings were created with the modern System 4004 again. One of the drawings was printed as a poster for the Hannover Fair and for the 35th Venice Biennale in 1970. There were also computer drawings for fair pavilions of the Siemens AG, such as the \"German Industry Exhibition\" in São Paulo in 1971.\n\nLudwig Rase experimented based on the cuboctahedron for residential dwellings and urban design with Nees creating the computer aided design plans for the project. The graphic \"Cuboctahedron\" developed during this was used for the cover and poster of the exhibition \"Computer art. nees rase\" in the Hamburger Kunsthalle in 1972.\n\nNees retired in 1985 and started his research and experiments again. He devoted his time solely to semiotics and aesthetics for media and design. He published the results from 1995 onwards in several books and articles.\n\nIn 1985, Alex Kempkens asked Nees whether he wished to participate in the exhibition \"Bilder Images Digital\" in the ″Gallery of the Artist″ in Munich, which was planned for October 1986. He said yes and created a new series of computer graphics. These graphics have a special position within the oeuvre by Nees. To generate the graphics he gave the AI engine simple, philosophical as well as mythical commands. Based on the commands, the computer produced different graphics. He wrote the programs in the Lisp language and a System 7000 calculated the graphics. Nees wrote in the exhibition catalog: \nMy own computer graphics in the spring of 1986, I understand as studies on ambience, as they could be synthesized by perhaps a future Reagiblen machines. An essential part task in the design of such machines is thinking out sample dialogues, which one would like to perform with the finished instrument. The following dialog could then be feasible: ″Show me a sphere.″ The automaton would respond with the production of the image ″sphere north-west-nadir.″ The dialog would continue with ″Add on the context, myth; visualize the contrast between law and coincidence.″; The response would be the image, ″Apollo and Dionysius″.\n\nThe art critic Eva Karcher wrote in the interpretation of his graphics:\nThe automaton as >creativity stimulant<? A mental concept which one can only consider cautiously and which however can call in question all the hitherto binding definitions of the inviolability of the human creative capacity.Looking at the multi-patterned constructions in Nees' graphics, with their floating ellipsoids, crystalloid spheres and bizarre forms, one cannot help but acknowledge and appreciate their atmospheric and inspiration-inducing effects.\n\nNees died on 3 January 2016 at the age of 89.\n\n\"Apoll und Dionysos\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Nees was not only a pioneer of computer art, but also one of the grandfathers of computer supported design processes – the Generative Design.\nIn 1963, the Zuse Graphomat Z64 was used to draw technical plans, which are required for the manufacture of parts and products. As he said, he thought also of his ideas - to make experimental and generative design. The reason for him to write the book \"Formel - Farbe - Form\", 1995, was to convey his knowledge about \"Computer aesthetics of Media and Design\" - based on generative design - to the next generation of designers. The current generation of designers uses as professional title for example \"generative design\" and operates under the concept of generative Design, data driven art or computational design. Nees also makes it one of the progenitors of today's generative design for art, advertising and animation – based on his Ph.D. thesis \"Generative Computergraphik\" and the book \"Generative Computergraphik\" in 1969.\n\n"}

A glide reflection can be seen as a limiting rotoreflection, where the rotation becomes a translation. It can also be given a Schoenflies notation as S, Coxeter notation as [∞,2], and orbifold notation as ∞×.\n\nThe combination of a reflection in a line and a translation in a perpendicular direction is a reflection in a parallel line. However, a glide reflection cannot be reduced like that. Thus the effect of a reflection combined with \"any\" translation is a glide reflection, with as special case just a reflection. These are the two kinds of indirect isometries in 2D.\n\nFor example, there is an isometry consisting of the reflection on the \"x\"-axis, followed by translation of one unit parallel to it. In coordinates, it takes\n\nIt fixes a system of parallel lines.\n\nThe isometry group generated by just a glide reflection is an infinite cyclic group.\n\nCombining two equal glide reflections gives a pure translation with a translation vector that is twice that of the glide reflection, so the even powers of the glide reflection form a translation group.\n\nIn the case of glide reflection symmetry, the symmetry group of an object contains a glide reflection, and hence the group generated by it. If that is all it contains, this type is frieze group p11g.\n\nExample pattern with this symmetry group:\n\nFrieze group nr. 6 (glide-reflections, translations and rotations) is generated by a glide reflection and a rotation about a point on the line of reflection. It is isomorphic to a semi-direct product of Z and \"C\".\n\nExample pattern with this symmetry group:\n\nA typical example of glide reflection in everyday life would be the track of footprints left in the sand by a person walking on a beach.\n\nFor any symmetry group containing some glide reflection symmetry, the translation vector of any glide reflection is one half of an element of the translation group. If the translation vector of a glide reflection is itself an element of the translation group, then the corresponding glide reflection symmetry reduces to a combination of reflection symmetry and translational symmetry.\n\nGlide reflection symmetry with respect to two parallel lines with the same translation implies that there is also translational symmetry in the direction perpendicular to these lines, with a translation distance which is twice the distance between glide reflection lines. This corresponds to wallpaper group pg; with additional symmetry it occurs also in pmg, pgg and p4g.\n\nIf there are also true reflection lines in the same direction then they are evenly spaced between the glide reflection lines. A glide reflection line parallel to a true reflection line already implies this situation. This corresponds to wallpaper group cm. The translational symmetry is given by oblique translation vectors from one point on a true reflection line to two points on the next, supporting a rhombus with the true reflection line as one of the diagonals. With additional symmetry it occurs also in cmm, p3m1, p31m, p4m and p6m.\n\nIn 3D the glide reflection is called a glide plane. It is a reflection in a plane combined with a translation parallel to the plane.\n\nIn the Euclidean plane 3 of 17 wallpaper groups require glide reflection generators. p2gg has orthogonal glide reflections and 2-fold rotations. cm has parallel mirrors and glides, and pg has parallel glides.

She focused on humanities students with the expectation that their mathematical experience would be less significant than that of their peers studying mathematics and physics, so the epistemological obstacles they exhibit would be more representative of the obstacles that \"may\" still be present in lyceum students.\n\nSierpińska initially expected the students to balk at assigning a value to Grandi's series, at which point she could shock them by claiming that as a result of the geometric series formula. Ideally, by searching for the error in reasoning and by investigating the formula for various common ratios, the students would \"notice that there are two kinds of series and an implicit conception of convergence will be born.\" However, the students showed no shock at being told that or even that . Sierpińska remarks that \"a priori\", the students' reaction shouldn't be too surprising given that Leibniz and Grandi thought ⁄ to be a plausible result;\n\nThe students were ultimately not immune to the question of convergence; Sierpińska succeeded in engaging them in the issue by linking it to decimal expansions the following day. As soon as 0.999... = 1 caught the students by surprise, the rest of her material \"went past their ears\".\n\nIn another study conducted in Treviso, Italy around the year 2000, third-year and fourth-year \"Liceo Scientifico\" pupils (between 16 and 18 years old) were given cards asking the following:\n\nThe students had been introduced to the idea of an infinite set, but they had no prior experience with infinite series.

Some 16 of them justified an answer of 0 using logic similar to that of Grandi and Riccati. Others justified ⁄ as being the average of 0 and 1. Bagni notes that their reasoning, while similar to Leibniz's, lacks the probabilistic basis that was so important to 18th-century mathematics. He concludes that the responses are consistent with a link between historical development and individual development, although the cultural context is different.\n\nJoel Lehmann describes the process of distinguishing between different sum concepts as building a bridge over a conceptual crevasse: the confusion over divergence that dogged 18th-century mathematics.\n\nAs a result, many students develop an attitude similar to Euler's:\n\nLehmann recommends meeting this objection with the same example that was advanced against Euler's treatment of Grandi's series by Callet.\n\n"}

They are used in three ways: \n\nHatch marks are frequently used as an abbreviation of some common units of measurement. In regard to distance, a single hatch mark indicates feet, and two hatch marks indicate inches. In regard to time, a single hatch mark indicates minutes, and two hatch marks indicate seconds.\nIn geometry and trigonometry, such marks are used following an elevated circle to indicate degrees, minutes, and seconds — ( ° ) ( ′ ) ( ″ ).\n\nHatch marks can probably be traced to hatching in art works, where the pattern of the hatch marks represents a unique tone or hue. Different patterns indicate different tones.\n\nUnit-and-value hatch marks are short vertical line segments which mark distances. They are seen on rulers and number lines. The marks are parallel to each other and are evenly spaced.\n\nThe distance between adjacent marks is one unit. Longer line segments are used for integers and natural numbers. Shorter line segments are used for fractions.\n\nHatch marks provide a visual clue as to the value of specific points on the number line, even if some hatch marks are not labeled with a number.\n\nHatch marks are typically seen in number theory and geometry.\n\nIn geometry, hatch marks are used to denote equal measures of angles, arcs, line segments, or other elements. \n\nHatch marks for congruency notation are in the style of tally marks or of Roman numerals – with some qualifications. These marks are without serifs, and some patterns are not used. For example, the numbers I, II, III, V, and X are used, but IV and VI are not used since a rotation of 180 degrees can make a 4 easily confused with a 6.\n\nFor example, if two triangles are drawn, the first pair of congruent sides can be marked with a single hatch mark on each. The second pair of congruent sides can be marked with two hatch marks each. The patterns are not alike: one pair uses one mark while the other pair uses two marks (Figure 1). This use of pattern makes it clear which sides are the same length even if the sides cannot be measured. If the sides do not appear to be congruent, as long as hatch marks are present and are the same number of hatch marks then the sides are congruent.\n\nNote that the inverse situation should not be assumed. That is, while sides that are hatch marked identically must be assumed to be congruent, it does not follow that sides hatch marked \"differently\" must be \"incongruent\". The different hatch marks simply signal that the lengths may be taken to be independent of each other. So, for example, while the triangles (Figure 1) cannot be shown to be isosceles triangles or equilateral triangles, nevertheless the possibility that they \"could\" be either of those things is not precluded based on what is shown.\n\nLine charts may sometimes use hatch marks as graphed points. In the early days of computers, monitors and printers could only make charts using the characters available on a common typewriter. To graph a line chart of sales over time, symbols such as *, x, or | were used to mark points and various characters were used to mark the lines connecting them. While computers have advanced considerably, it is still not unusual to see x or | used as the points of interest or points of change on a graph.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18757567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18757567", "title": "Longest path problem", "text": "Longest path problem\n\nIn graph theory and theoretical computer science, the longest path problem is the problem of finding a simple path of maximum length in a given graph. A path is called simple if it does not have any repeated vertices; the length of a path may either be measured by its number of edges, or (in weighted graphs) by the sum of the weights of its edges. In contrast to the shortest path problem, which can be solved in polynomial time in graphs without negative-weight cycles, the longest path problem is NP-hard, meaning that it cannot be solved in polynomial time for arbitrary graphs unless P = NP. Stronger hardness results are also known showing that it is difficult to approximate. However, it has a linear time solution for directed acyclic graphs, which has important applications in finding the critical path in scheduling problems.\n\nThe NP-hardness of the unweighted longest path problem can be shown using a reduction from the Hamiltonian path problem: a graph \"G\" has a Hamiltonian path if and only if its longest path has length \"n\" − 1, where \"n\" is the number of vertices in \"G\". Because the Hamiltonian path problem is NP-complete, this reduction shows that the decision version of the longest path problem is also NP-complete. In this decision problem, the input is a graph \"G\" and a number \"k\"; the desired output is \"yes\" if \"G\" contains a path of \"k\" or more edges, and \"no\" otherwise.\n\nIf the longest path problem could be solved in polynomial time, it could be used to solve this decision problem, by finding a longest path and then comparing its length to the number \"k\". Therefore, the longest path problem is NP-hard. The question \"does there exist a simple path in a given graph with at least \"k\" edges\" is NP-complete.\n\nIn weighted complete graphs with non-negative edge weights, the weighted longest path problem is the same as the Travelling salesman path problem, because the longest path always includes all vertices.\n\nA longest path between two given vertices \"s\" and \"t\" in a weighted graph \"G\" is the same thing as a shortest path in a graph −\"G\" derived from \"G\" by changing every weight to its negation. Therefore, if shortest paths can be found in −\"G\", then longest paths can also be found in \"G\".\n\nFor most graphs, this transformation is not useful because it creates cycles of negative length in −\"G\". But if \"G\" is a directed acyclic graph, then no negative cycles can be created, and a longest path in \"G\" can be found in linear time by applying a linear time algorithm for shortest paths in −\"G\", which is also a directed acyclic graph. For instance, for each vertex \"v\" in a given DAG, the length of the longest path ending at \"v\" may be obtained by the following steps:\nOnce this has been done, the longest path in the whole DAG may be obtained by starting at the vertex \"v\" with the largest recorded value, then repeatedly stepping backwards to its incoming neighbor with the largest recorded value, and reversing the sequence of vertices found in this way.\n\nThe critical path method for scheduling a set of activities involves the construction of a directed acyclic graph in which the vertices represent project milestones and the edges represent activities that must be performed after one milestone and before another; each edge is weighted by an estimate of the amount of time the corresponding activity will take to complete. In such a graph, the longest path from the first milestone to the last one is the critical path, which describes the total time for completing the project.\n\nLongest paths of directed acyclic graphs may also be applied in layered graph drawing: assigning each vertex \"v\" of a directed acyclic graph \"G\" to the layer whose number is the length of the longest path ending at \"v\" results in a layer assignment for \"G\" with the minimum possible number of layers.\n\n write that the longest path problem in unweighted undirected graphs \"is notorious for the difficulty of understanding its approximation hardness\".\nThe best polynomial time approximation algorithm known for this case achieves only a very weak approximation ratio, formula_1. For all formula_2, it is not possible to approximate the longest path to within a factor of formula_3 unless NP is contained within quasi-polynomial deterministic time; however, there is a big gap between this inapproximability result and the known approximation algorithms for this problem.\n\nIn the case of unweighted but directed graphs, strong inapproximability results are known. For every formula_2 the problem cannot be approximated to within a factor of formula_5 unless P = NP, and with stronger complexity-theoretic assumptions it cannot be approximated to within a factor of formula_6. The color-coding technique can be used to find paths of logarithmic length, if they exist, but this gives an approximation ratio of only formula_7.\n\nThe longest path problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the length of the path. For instance, it can be solved in time linear in the size of the input graph (but exponential in the length of the path), by an algorithm that performs the following steps:\nSince the output path has length at least as large as formula_8, the running time is also bounded by formula_13, where formula_14 is the length of the longest path. Using color-coding, the dependence on path length can be reduced to singly exponential. A similar dynamic programming technique shows that the longest path problem is also fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the treewidth of the graph.\n\nFor graphs of bounded clique-width, the longest path can also be solved by a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm. However, the exponent of the polynomial depends on the clique-width of the graph, so this algorithms is not fixed-parameter tractable. The longest path problem, parameterized by clique-width, is hard for the parameterized complexity class formula_15, showing that a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm is unlikely to exist.\n\nA linear-time algorithm for finding a longest path in a tree was proposed by Dijkstra in 1960's, while a formal proof of this algorithm was published in 2002.\nFurthermore, a longest path can be computed in polynomial time on weighted trees, on block graphs, on cacti,\non bipartite permutation graphs,\nand on Ptolemaic graphs.\n\nFor the class of interval graphs, an formula_16-time algorithm is known, which uses a dynamic programming approach.\nThis dynamic programming approach has been exploited to obtain polynomial-time algorithms on the greater classes of circular-arc graphs\nand of co-comparability graphs (i.e. of the complements of comparability graphs, which also contain permutation graphs),\nboth having the same running time formula_16. The latter algorithm is based on special properties of the Lexicographic Depth First Search (LDFS) vertex ordering\nof co-comparability graphs. For co-comparability graphs also an alternative polynomial-time algorithm with higher running time formula_18 is known, which is based on the Hasse diagram of the partially ordered set defined by the complement of the input co-comparability graph.\n\nFurthermore, the longest path problem is solvable in polynomial time on any class of graphs with bounded treewidth or bounded clique-width, such as the distance-hereditary graphs. Finally, it is clearly NP-hard on all graph classes on which the Hamiltonian path problem is NP-hard, such as on split graphs, circle graphs, and planar graphs.\n\n\n"}

Even in the same time period, such as in the 2010s, different styles of music and different cultures use different music notation methods; for example, for professional classical music performers, sheet music using staves and noteheads is the most common way of notating music, but for professional country music session musicians, the Nashville Number System is the main method.\n\nThe symbols used include ancient symbols and modern symbols made upon any media such as symbols cut into stone, made in clay tablets, made using a pen on papyrus or parchment or manuscript paper; printed using a printing press (ca. 1400s), a computer printer (ca. 1980s) or other printing or modern copying technology.\n\nAlthough many ancient cultures used symbols to represent melodies and rhythms, none of them were particularly comprehensive, and this has limited today's understanding of their music. The seeds of what would eventually become modern western notation were sown in medieval Europe, starting with the Catholic Church's goal for ecclesiastical uniformity. The church began notating plainchant melodies so that the same chants could be used throughout the church. Music notation developed further in the Renaissance and Baroque music eras. In the classical period (1750–1820) and the Romantic music era (1820–1900), notation continued to develop as new musical instrument technologies were developed. In the contemporary classical music of the 20th and 21st century, music notation has continued to develop, with the introduction of graphical notation by some modern composers and the use, since the 1980s, of computer-based score writer programs for notating music. Music notation has been adapted to many kinds of music, including classical music, popular music, and [[traditional music]\n\n[[File:Hurritische hymne.gif|right|frame|A drawing of one side of the tablet on which the Hymn to Nikkal is inscribed]]\nThe earliest form of musical notation can be found in a [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablet that was created at [[Nippur]], in [[Sumer]] (today's [[Iraq]]), in about 1400 BC. The tablet represents fragmentary instructions for performing music, that the music was composed in harmonies of thirds, and that it was written using a [[diatonic scale]]. A tablet from about 1250 BC shows a more developed form of notation. Although the interpretation of the notation system is still controversial, it is clear that the notation indicates the names of strings on a [[lyre]], the tuning of which is described in other tablets. Although they are fragmentary, these tablets represent the earliest notated [[melody|melodies]] found anywhere in the world.\n\n[[File:Delphichymn.jpg|thumb|250px|A photograph of the original stone at Delphi containing the second of the two [[Delphic Hymns]] to [[Apollo]]. The music notation is the line of occasional symbols \"above\" the main, uninterrupted line of Greek lettering.]]\n\n[[Music of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] musical notation was in use from at least the 6th century BC until approximately the 4th century AD; several complete compositions and fragments of compositions using this notation survive. The notation consists of symbols placed above text syllables. An example of a complete composition is the [[Seikilos epitaph]], which has been variously dated between the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD.\n\nThree hymns by [[Mesomedes]] of [[Crete]] exist in manuscript. The [[Delphic Hymns]], dated to the 2nd century BC, also use this notation, but they are not completely preserved. Ancient Greek notation appears to have fallen out of use around the time of the [[Decline of the Western Roman Empire]].\n\n[[File:Stavropoleos-anastasimatar-macarie-viena-1823-p11.png|thumb|right|250px|Byzantine music notation style in a Romanian \"anastasimatarion\", a \"Book of Hymns at the Lord's Resurrection\", 1823]]\n\n[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] music has mainly survived as music for court ceremonies, including vocal religious music. It is not known if it is based on the [[monody|monodic]] [[Musical mode#Greek scales|modal]] singing and instrumental music of [[Ancient Greece]]. Greek theoretical categories played a key role to understand and transmit Byzantine music, especially the tradition of Damascus had a strong impact on the pre-Islamic [[Near East]] comparable to [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]].\n\nUnlike Western notation Byzantine neumes always indicate modal steps in relation to a clef or modal key ([[Enechema|modal signatures]] which had been in use since papyrus fragments dating back to the 6th century). Originally this key or the incipit of a common melody was enough to indicate a certain melodic model given within the [[echos]]. Despite [[ekphonetic notation]] further early melodic notation developed not earlier than between the 9th and the 10th century. Like the Greek alphabet notational signs are ordered left to right (though the direction could be adapted like in certain Syriac manuscripts). The question of rhythm was entirely based on cheironomia, well-known melodical phrases given by gestures of the [[Cantor (Christianity)|choirleaders]], which existed once as part of an oral tradition.\n\nToday the main difference between Western and Eastern neumes is that Eastern notation symbols are \"differential\" rather than absolute, i.e. they indicate pitch steps (rising, falling or at the same step), and the musicians know to deduce correctly, from the score and the note they are singing presently, which correct interval is meant. These step symbols themselves, or better \"phonic neumes\", resemble brush strokes and are colloquially called \"gántzoi\" (\"hooks\") in [[Modern Greek]].\n\nNotes as pitch classes or modal keys (usually memorised by modal signatures) are represented in written form only between these neumes (in manuscripts usually written in red ink). In modern notation they simply serve as an optional reminder and modal and tempo directions have been added, if necessary. In Papadic notation medial signatures usually meant a temporary change into another echos.\n\nThe so-called \"great signs\" were once related to cheironomic signs; according to modern interpretations they are understood as embellishments and microtonal attractions (pitch changes smaller than a [[semitone]]), both essential in Byzantine chant.\n\n[[File:ChrysanthosTable.png|thumb|400px|center|Chrysanthos' \"Kanonion\" with a comparison between Ancient Greek tetraphonia (column 1), Western [[Solfeggio]], the \"Papadic Parallage\" (ascending: column 3 and 4; descending: column 5 and 6) according to the \"trochos system\", and his heptaphonic \"parallage\" according to the New Method (syllables in the fore-last and \"martyriai\" in the last column) ([[#Chr1832|1832, p. 33]])]]\n\nSince [[Chrysanthos of Madytos]] there are seven standard note names used for \"solfège\" (\"parallagē\") \"pá, vú, gá, dē, ké, zō, nē\", while the older practice still used the four enechemata or intonation formulas of the four echoi given by the modal signatures, the authentic or \"kyrioi\" in ascending direction, and the plagal or \"plagioi\" in descending direction ([[Papadic Octoechos]]). With exception of \"vú and zō\" they do roughly correspond to Western solmization syllables as \"re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do\". Byzantine music uses the eight natural, non-tempered scales whose elements were identified by \"Ēkhoi\", \"sounds\", exclusively, and therefore the absolute pitch of each note may slightly vary each time, depending on the particular \"Ēkhos\" used. Byzantine notation is still used in many Orthodox Churches. Sometimes cantors also use transcriptions into Western or Kievan staff notation while adding non-notatable embellishment material from memory and \"sliding\" into the natural scales from experience, but even concerning modern neume editions since the reform of Chrysanthos a lot of details are only known from an oral tradition related to traditional masters and their experience.\n\nIn 1252, [[Safi al-Din al-Urmawi]] developed a form of musical notation, where [[rhythm]]s were represented by [[Geometry|geometric]] representation. Many subsequent scholars of rhythm have sought to develop graphical geometrical notations. For example, a similar geometric system was published in 1987 by Kjell Gustafson, whose method represents a rhythm as a two-dimensional graph.\n\n[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|Music notation from an early 14th-century English [[Missal]]]]\nThe scholar and music theorist [[Isidore of Seville]], while writing in the early 7th century, considered that \"unless sounds are held by the memory of man, they perish, because they cannot be written down.\" By the middle of the 9th century, however, a form of neumatic notation began to develop in monasteries in Europe as a [[mnemonic]] device for [[Gregorian chant]], using symbols known as [[neume]]s; the earliest surviving musical notation of this type is in the \"Musica disciplina\" of [[Aurelian of Réôme]], from about 850. There are scattered survivals from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] before this time, of a type of notation known as [[Neume|Visigothic neumes]], but its few surviving fragments have not yet been deciphered. The problem with this notation was that it only showed melodic contours and consequently the music could not be read by someone who did not know the music already.\n\n[[File:EarlyMusicNotation.JPG|250px|thumb|Early music notation]]\n\nNotation had developed far enough to notate melody, but there was still no system for notating rhythm. A mid-13th-century treatise, \"[[De Mensurabili Musica]]\", explains a set of six [[rhythmic modes]] that were in use at the time, although it is not clear how they were formed. These rhythmic modes were all in triple time and rather limited rhythm in chant to six different repeating patterns. This was a flaw seen by German music theorist [[Franco of Cologne]] and summarised as part of his treatise \"Ars cantus mensurabilis\" (the art of measured chant, or [[mensural notation]]). He suggested that individual notes could have their own rhythms represented by the shape of the note. Not until the 14th century did something like the present system of fixed note lengths arise. The use of regular measures (bars) became commonplace by the end of the 17th century.\n\nThe founder of what is now considered the standard music stave was [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d'Arezzo]], an Italian Benedictine monk who lived from about 991 until after 1033. He taught the use of [[solmization]] syllables based on a hymn to [[Saint John the Baptist]], which begins [[Ut Queant Laxis]] and was written by the [[Lombards|Lombard]] historian [[Paul the Deacon]]. The first stanza is:\n\n\nGuido used the first syllable of each line, Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and Si, to read notated music in terms of [[Guidonian hand#Hexachord in Middle Ages|hexachords]]; they were not note names, and each could, depending on context, be applied to any note. In the 17th century, Ut was changed in most countries except France to the easily singable, \"open\" syllable Do, said to have been taken from the name of the Italian theorist [[Giovanni Battista Doni]],\nbut rather Do have been taken from the word \"Dominus\" in Latin with the meaning \"the Lord\". \n\nCatholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church, and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.\n\n[[File:Chopin Prelude 7.svg|thumb|500px|An example of modern musical notation: Prelude, Op. 28, No. 7, by [[Frédéric Chopin]] ]]\n\nModern music notation is used by musicians of many different genres throughout the world. The staff acts as a framework upon which pitches are indicated by placing round [[Musical note|note]]s on the staff lines or between the lines. The pitch of the round musical notes can be modified by [[accidental (music)|accidentals]]. The duration (note length) is shown with different [[note value]]s, which can be indicated by the note being just a circle (a [[whole note]]) or using stems to indicate [[quarter note]]s and other subdivisions, and additional symbols such as [[dotted note|dots]] and [[Tie (music)|ties]] which lengthen the duration of a note. Notation is read from left to right, which makes setting music for right-to-left scripts difficult.\n\nA staff (or stave, in British English) of written music generally begins with a [[clef]], which indicates the position of one particular note on the staff. The [[treble clef]] or G clef was originally a letter G and it identifies the second line up on the five line staff as the note G above middle C. The [[bass clef]] or F clef shows the position of the note F below middle C. While the treble and bass clef are the most widely used clefs, other clefs are used, such as the [[alto clef]] (used for [[viola]] and [[alto trombone]] music) and the [[tenor clef]] (used for some [[cello]] and [[double bass]] music). Notes representing a pitch outside of the scope of the five line staff can be represented using [[ledger line]]s, which provide a single note with additional lines and spaces. Some instruments use mainly one clef, such as violin and flute, which use [[treble clef]] and [[double bass]] and [[tuba]], which use [[bass clef]]. Some instruments regularly use both clefs, such as [[piano]] and [[pipe organ]].\n\nFollowing the clef, the [[key signature]] on a staff indicates the [[key (music)|key]] of the piece or song by specifying that certain notes are flat or sharp throughout the piece, unless otherwise indicated with [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] added before certain notes. When a sharp is placed before a note, this makes that note one semitone higher. When a flat is placed before a note, this makes that note one semitone lower. [[Double sharp]]s and [[double flat]]s are less common, but they are used. A double sharp is placed before a note to make it two semitones higher. A double flat is placed before a note to make it two semitones lower. A [[natural sign]] placed before a note renders that note in its \"natural\" form, which means that any sharps or flats applying to that note from the key signature or from accidentals are cancelled. Sometimes a [[courtesy accidental]] is used in music where it is not technically required, to remind the musician of what pitch the key signature requires.\n\nFollowing the key signature is the [[time signature]]. The time signature typically consists of two numbers, with one of the most common being \"4/4\". The top \"4\" indicates that there are four beats per measure (also called [[Bar (music)|bar]]). The bottom \"4\" indicates that each of those beats are quarter notes. Measures divide the piece into groups of [[beat (music)|beats]], and the time signatures specify those groupings. \"4/4\" is used so often that it is also called \"[[common time]]\", and it may be indicated with a \"C\" rather than numbers. Other common time signatures are \"3/4\" (three beats per bar, with each beat being a quarter note); \"2/4\" (two beats per bar, with each beat being a quarter note); \"6/8\" (six beats per bar, with each beat being an eighth note) and \"12/8\" (twelve beats per bar, with each beat being an eighth note; in practice, the eighth notes are typically put into four groups of three eighth notes. \"12/8\" is a [[compound time]] type of time signature). Many other time signatures exist, such as \"3/8\", \"5/8\", \"5/4\", \"7/4\", \"9/8\", and so on.\n\nMany short [[classical music]] pieces from the [[classical period (music)|classical era]] and songs from [[traditional music]] and [[popular music]] are in one time signature for much or all of the piece. Music from the [[Romantic music]] era and later, particularly [[contemporary classical music]] and [[rock music]] genres such as [[progressive rock]] and the [[hardcore punk]] subgenre [[mathcore]], may use [[mixed meter]]; songs or pieces change from one meter to another, for example alternating between bars of \"5/4\" and \"7/8\".\n\nDirections to the player regarding matters such as [[tempo]] (e.g., [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]], [[Andante (tempo)|Andante]], [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Largo]], [[Tempo#French tempo markings|Vif, Lent, Modérément]], [[Presto (music)|Presto]], etc.), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (pianississimo, pianissimo, piano, mezzopiano, mezzoforte, forte, fortissimo, fortississimo, etc.) appear above or below the staff. Terms indicating the [[musical expression]] or \"feel\" to a song or piece are indicated at the beginning of the piece and at any points where the mood changes (e.g., \"Slow March\", \"Fast Swing\", \"Medium Blues\", \"Fougueux\", \"Feierlich\", \"Gelassen\", \"Piacevole\", \"Con slancio\", \"Majestic\", \"Hostile\" etc.) For vocal music, lyrics are written near the pitches of the melody. For short pauses (breaths), [[retake]]s (retakes are indicated with a ' mark) are added.\n\nIn music for [[musical ensemble|ensembles]], a \"[[sheet music|score]]\" shows music for all players together, with the staves for the different instruments and/or voices stacked vertically. The [[conducting|conductor]] uses the score while she leads an [[orchestra]], [[concert band]], [[choir]] or other large ensemble. Individual performers in an ensemble play from \"parts\" which contain only the music played by an individual musician. A score can be constructed from a complete set of parts and vice versa. The process was laborious and time consuming when parts were hand-copied from the score, but since the development of [[scorewriter]] computer software in the 1980s, a score stored electronically can have parts automatically prepared by the program and quickly and inexpensively printed out using a computer printer. \n\nA [[Flat (music)|♭]] in music lowers a pitch down one semitone. A [[Sharp (music)|♯]] in music raises a note one semitone. For example, a sharp on B would raise it do B♯ while a flat would lower it to B♭.\n\n[[File:Lead-sheet-wikipedia.svg|thumb|250px|A lead sheet]]\n[[File:Chord chart.svg|thumb|250px|A chord chart. ]]\n\n[[File:시용향악보 (時用鄕樂譜).jpg|200px|thumb|\"Jeongganbo musical notation system\"]]\n\"Jeongganbo\" is a unique traditional musical notation system created during the time of [[Sejong the Great]] that was the first East Asian system to represent rhythm, pitch, and time. Among various kinds of Korean traditional music, Jeong-gan-bo targets a particular genre, Jeong-ak (정악, 正樂).\n\nJeong-gan-bo tells the pitch by writing the pitch's name down in a box called 'jeong-gan' (this is where the name comes from). One jeong-gan is one beat each, and it can be split into two, three or more to hold half beats and quarter beats, and more. This makes it easy for the reader to figure out the beat.\n\nAlso, there are lots of markings indicating things such as ornaments. Most of these were later created by Ki-su Kim.\n\n[[File:Bhat notation1.jpg|thumb|350px|Indian music, early 20th century.]]\nThe Indian scholar and musical theorist [[Pingala]] (c. 200 BC), in his \"Chanda Sutra\", used marks indicating long and short syllables to indicate meters in Sanskrit poetry.\n\nIn the notation of Indian [[rāga]], a solfege-like system called [[swara|sargam]] is used. As in Western solfege, there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale (Shadaj, Rishabh, Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad, usually shortened Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni). The tonic of any scale is named Sa, and the dominant Pa. Sa is fixed in any scale, and Pa is fixed at a fifth above it (a [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean]] fifth rather than an [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] fifth). These two notes are known as achala swar ('fixed notes').\n\nEach of the other five notes, Re, Ga, Ma, Dha and Ni, can take a 'regular' (shuddha) pitch, which is equivalent to its pitch in a standard major scale (thus, shuddha Re, the second degree of the scale, is a whole-step higher than Sa), or an altered pitch, either a half-step above or half-step below the shuddha pitch. Re, Ga, Dha and Ni all have altered partners that are a half-step lower (Komal-\"flat\") (thus, komal Re is a half-step higher than Sa).\n\nMa has an altered partner that is a half-step higher (teevra-\"sharp\") (thus, tivra Ma is an augmented fourth above Sa). Re, Ga, Ma, Dha and Ni are called vikrut swar ('movable notes'). In the written system of Indian notation devised by Ravi Shankar, the pitches are represented by Western letters. Capital letters are used for the achala swar, and for the higher variety of all the vikrut swar. Lowercase letters are used for the lower variety of the vikrut swar.\n\nOther systems exist for non-twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] and non-Western music, such as the Indian \"[[Swaralipi]]\".\n\n[[Image:Example of hooks and banners notation.PNG|thumb|200px|right|An example of Znamenny notation with so-called \"red marks\", Russia, 1884. \"Thy [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Cross]] we honour, oh Lord, and Thy holy Resurrection we praise.\"]]\n[[Image:Kryuki.jpg|thumb|160px|A hand-drawn [[lubok]] featuring 'hook and banner notation'.]] \nZnamenny Chant is a singing tradition used in the [[Russia]]n [[Orthodox Church]] which uses a \"hook and banner\" notation. Znamenny Chant is [[unison]], [[melisma]]tic [[liturgy|liturgical]] singing that has its own specific notation, called the \"stolp\" notation. The symbols used in the stolp notation are called ' (, 'hooks') or ' (, 'signs'). Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the stolp notation. Znamenny melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Modes (intonation structures; called glasy); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness. There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called \"Stolpovoy\", \"Malyj\" (Little) and \"Bolshoy\" (Great) Znamenny Chant. Ruthenian Chant ([[Prostopinije]]) is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum.\n\nZnamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so-called linear notation), but with special signs, called \"Znamëna\" (Russian for \"marks\", \"banners\") or \"Kryuki\" (\"hooks\"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure. The stolp notation was developed in [[Kievan Rus']] as an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] refinement of the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] [[neumatic]] musical notation.\n\nThe most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than [[Musical note|note]]s. The signs also represent a mood and a gradation of how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.) Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called \"little dove\" (Russian: голубчик \"(golubchik)\"), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the [[Holy Ghost]]. Gradually the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way.\n\n[[File:Qinnotation.png|thumb|250px|Chinese [[Guqin notation]], 1425]]\nThe earliest known examples of text referring to music in China are inscriptions on musical instruments found in the Tomb of [[Marquess|Marquis]] Yi of Zeng (d. 433 B.C.). Sets of 41 chimestones and 65 bells bore lengthy inscriptions concerning pitches, scales, and transposition. The bells still sound the pitches that their inscriptions refer to. Although no notated musical compositions were found, the inscriptions indicate that the system was sufficiently advanced to allow for musical notation. Two systems of pitch nomenclature existed, one for relative pitch and one for absolute pitch. For relative pitch, a [[solmization]] system was used.\n\n[[Gongche notation]] used Chinese characters for the names of the scale.\n\n[[File:Tempyo Biwa Fu.jpg|thumb|\"Tempyō Biwa Fu\" 天平琵琶譜 (circa 738 AD), musical notation for [[Biwa]]. ([[Shōsōin]], at Nara, Japan)]]\nJapanese music is highly diversified, and therefore requires various systems of notation. In Japanese [[shakuhachi]] music, for example, glissandos and timbres are often more significant than distinct pitches, whereas [[taiko]] notation focuses on discrete strokes.\n\n[[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyuan]] [[sanshin]] music uses [[kunkunshi]], a notation system of [[kanji]] with each character corresponding to a finger position on a particular string.\n\nNotation plays a relatively minor role in the oral traditions of [[Indonesia]]. However, in [[Java]] and [[Bali]], several systems were devised beginning at the end of the 19th century, initially for archival purposes. Today the most widespread are cipher notations (\"not angka\" in the broadest sense) in which the pitches are represented with some subset of the numbers 1 to 7, with 1 corresponding to either highest note of a particular octave, as in [[Sundanese script|Sundanese]] [[gamelan]], or lowest, as in the [[kepatihan notation]] of [[Java]]nese [[gamelan]].\n\nNotes in the ranges outside the central octave are represented with one or more dots above or below the each number. For the most part, these cipher notations are mainly used to notate the skeletal melody (the [[balungan]]) and vocal parts ([[gerong]]an), although transcriptions of the elaborating instrument variations are sometimes used for analysis and teaching. Drum parts are notated with a system of symbols largely based on letters representing the vocables used to learn and remember drumming patterns; these symbols are typically laid out in a grid underneath the skeletal melody for a specific or generic piece.\n\nThe symbols used for drum notation (as well as the vocables represented) are highly variable from place to place and performer to performer. In addition to these current systems, two older notations used a kind of staff: the [[Surakarta|Solo]]nese script could capture the flexible rhythms of the [[Sindhen|pesinden]] with a squiggle on a horizontal staff, while in [[Yogyakarta]] a ladder-like vertical staff allowed notation of the balungan by dots and also included important drum strokes. In Bali, there are a few books published of [[Gamelan gender wayang]] pieces, employing alphabetical notation in the old Balinese script.\n\nComposers and scholars both Indonesian and foreign have also mapped the [[slendro]] and [[pelog]] [[Musical tuning|tuning]] systems of gamelan onto the western staff, with and without various symbols for [[microtonal music|microtones]]. The Dutch composer [[Ton de Leeuw]] also invented a three line staff for his composition \"Gending\". However, these systems do not enjoy widespread use.\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, Indonesian musicians and scholars extended cipher notation to other oral traditions, and a [[diatonic and chromatic|diatonic scale]] cipher notation has become common for notating western-related genres (church hymns, popular songs, and so forth). Unlike the cipher notation for gamelan music, which uses a \"fixed Do\" (that is, 1 always corresponds to the same pitch, within the natural variability of gamelan tuning), Indonesian diatonic cipher notation is \"moveable-Do\" notation, so scores must indicate which pitch corresponds to the number 1 (for example, \"1=C\").\n\nIn pitch bracket notation music is written with melody lines and pitch brackets. Melody lines are like staff lines except they can change pitch by writing pitch brackets on them. Pitch brackets add or subtract scale steps to the melody line. The shape of the bracket (i.e. angle bracket), determines the number of scale steps to add. The direction of the bracket, opening or closing, determines whether to add or subtract scale steps. As a result of the mathematical nature of pitch bracket notation, arithmetic and algebra can be directly applied to the notation. Musical variations can be mathematically generated from their themes.\n\nCipher notation systems assigning Arabic numerals to the [[major scale]] degrees have been used at least since the Iberian organ tablatures of the 16th-century and include such exotic adaptations as \"[[Siffernotskrift]]\". The one most widely in use today is the Chinese \"Jianpu\", discussed in the [[Numbered musical notation|main article]]. Numerals can of course also be assigned to different scale systems, as in the Javanese \"[[kepatihan]]\" notation [[Musical notation#Indonesia|described above]].\n\nSolfège is a way of assigning syllables to names of the musical scale. In order, they are today: \"Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do\" (for the octave). The classic variation is: \"Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do\". The first Western system of functional names for the musical notes was introduced by [[Guido of Arezzo]] (c. 991 – after 1033), using the beginning syllables of the first six musical lines of the Latin hymn [[Ut queant laxis]]. The original sequence was \"Ut Re Mi Fa Sol La\", where each verse started a scale note higher. \"Ut\" later became \"Do\". The equivalent syllables used in Indian music are: \"Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni\". See also: [[solfège]], [[swara|sargam]], [[Kodály method#Hand signs|Kodály hand signs]].\n\n[[Tonic sol-fa]] is a type of notation using the initial letters of solfège.\n\nThe notes of the 12-tone scale can be written by their letter names A–G, possibly with a trailing sharp or flat symbol, such as A or B.\n\nTablature was first used in the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]] for organ music and later in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] for [[lute]] music. In most lute tablatures, a staff is used, but instead of pitch values, the lines of the staff represent the strings of the instrument. The [[fret]]s to finger are written on each line, indicated by letters or numbers. Rhythm is written separately with one or another variation of standard note values indicating the duration of the fastest moving part. Few seem to have remarked on the fact that tablature combines in one notation system both the physical and technical requirements of play (the lines and symbols on them and in relation to each other representing the actual performance actions) with the unfolding of the music itself (the lines of tablature taken horizontally represent the actual temporal unfolding of the music). In later periods, lute and guitar music was written with standard notation. Tablature caught interest again in the late 20th century for popular [[guitar]] music and other fretted instruments, being easy to transcribe and share over the internet in [[ASCII tab|ASCII format]]. Websites like [[Tablature#OLGA.net|OLGA]] have archives of text-based popular music tablature.\n\nKlavarskribo (sometimes shortened to klavar) is a music notation system that was introduced in 1931 by the [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] Cornelis Pot. The name means \"keyboard writing\" in [[Esperanto]]. It differs from conventional music notation in a number of ways and is intended to be easily readable. Many klavar readers are from the Netherlands.\n\nSome chromatic systems have been created taking advantage of the layout of black and white keys of the standard piano keyboard. The \"staff\" is most widely referred to as \"piano roll\", created by extending the black and white piano keys.\n\nOver the past three centuries, hundreds of music notation systems have been proposed as alternatives to traditional western music notation. Many of these systems seek to improve upon traditional notation by using a \"chromatic staff\" in which each of the 12 pitch classes has its own unique place on the staff. Examples are the \"Ailler-Brennink\" notation, Jacques-Daniel Rochat's \"Dodeka\" music notation , Tom Reed's \"Twinline\" notation, Russell Ambrose's \"Ambrose Piano Tabs\", Paul Morris' \"Clairnote\", John Keller's \"Express Stave\", and José A. Sotorrio's \"Bilinear Music Notation\". These notation systems do not require the use of standard key signatures, accidentals, or clef signs. They also represent interval relationships more consistently and accurately than traditional notation. The Music Notation Project (formerly known as the Music Notation Modernization Association) has a website with information on many of these notation systems.\n\nThe term 'graphic notation' refers to the contemporary use of non-traditional symbols and text to convey information about the performance of a piece of music. Practitioners include [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]], [[Earle Brown]], [[Anthony Braxton]], [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Cornelius Cardew]], and [[Roger Reynolds]]. See \"Notations\", edited by John Cage and Alison Knowles, .\n\n[[Simplified Music Notation]] is an alternative form of musical notation designed to make [[sight reading|sight-reading]] easier. It is based on [[modern musical symbols|classical staff notation]], but incorporates [[sharp (music)|sharps]] and [[flat (music)|flats]] into the shape of the [[note heads]]. [[Musical note|Note]]s such as [[sharp (music)|double sharps]] and [[flat (music)|double flats]] are written at the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] they are actually played at, but preceded by [[symbol]]s called \"history signs\" that show they have been [[transposition (music)|transposed]].\n\n[[Modified Stave Notation]] (MSN) is an alternative way of notating music for people who cannot easily read ordinary musical notation even if it is enlarged.\n\nParsons code is used to encode music so that it can be easily searched.\n\nBraille music is a complete, well developed, and internationally accepted musical notation system that has symbols and notational conventions quite independent of print music notation. It is linear in nature, similar to a printed language and different from the two-dimensional nature of standard printed music notation. To a degree Braille music resembles musical markup languages such as [[MusicXML]] or [[Notation Interchange File Format|NIFF]].\n\nIn [[integer notation]], or the [[integer]] model of pitch, all [[pitch class]]es and [[interval (music)|interval]]s between pitch classes are designated using the numbers 0 through 11.\n\nThe standard form of rap notation is the \"flow diagram\", where rappers line up their lyrics underneath \"beat numbers\". Hip-hop scholars also make use of the same flow diagrams that rappers use: the books \"How to Rap\" and \"How to Rap 2\" extensively use the diagrams to explain rap's triplets, flams, rests, rhyme schemes, runs of rhyme, and breaking rhyme patterns, among other techniques. Similar systems are used by musicologists Adam Krims in his book \"Rap Music and the Poetics of Identity\" and Kyle Adams in his work on rap's flow. As rap revolves around a strong 4/4 beat, with certain syllables aligned to the beat, all the notational systems have a similar structure: they all have four beat numbers at the top of the diagram, so that syllables can be written in-line with the beat.\n\nMany computer programs have been developed for creating music notation (called \"scorewriters\" or \"music notation software\"). Music may also be stored in various digital file formats for purposes other than graphic notation output.\n\nAccording to Philip Tagg and [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], musicology and to a degree European-influenced musical practice suffer from a 'notational centricity', a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation. A variety of 20th- and 21st-century composers have dealt with this problem, either by adapting standard Western musical notation or by using graphic notation. These include [[George Crumb]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Krzystof Penderecki]], [[Earle Brown|Earl Brown]], [[John Cage]], [[Witold Lutoslawski]], and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Musical notation| ]]\n[[Category:Mathematical notation]]"}

{"id": "3234401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3234401", "title": "Saxon math", "text": "Saxon math\n\nSaxon math, developed by John Saxon , is a teaching method for incremental learning of mathematics. It involves teaching a new mathematical concept every day and constantly reviewing old concepts. Early editions were deprecated for providing very few opportunities to practice the new material before plunging into a review of all previous material. Newer editions typically split the day's work evenly between practicing the new material and reviewing old material. Its primary strength is in a steady review of all previous material, which is especially important to students who struggle with retaining the math they previously learned.\n\nThe Saxon Math 1 to Algebra 1/2 (the equivalent of a Pre-Algebra book) curriculum is designed so that students complete assorted mental math problems, learn a new mathematical concept, practice problems relating to that lesson, and solve a variety of problems. Daily practice problems include relevant questions from the current day's lesson as well as cumulative problems. This daily cycle is interrupted for tests and additional topics. From Algebra 1/2 on, the higher level books remove the mental math problems and incorporate testing more frequently.\n\nThe Saxon math program has a specific set of products to support homeschoolers, including solution keys and ready-made tests, which makes it popular among some homeschool families. It has also been adopted as an alternative to reform mathematics programs in public and private schools. Saxon teaches memorization of algorithms, unlike many reform texts.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, many school districts were considering abandoning experiments with reform approaches which had not produced acceptable test scores. For example, school board member Debbie Winskill in Tacoma, Washington said that the non-traditional Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP) \"has been a dismal failure.\" Speaking to the board, Mount Tahoma High School teacher Clifford Harris noted that he taught sophomores in another district Saxon Math, and their Washington Assessment of Student Learning scores have continually climbed. Unlike IMP, Saxon program gives students plenty of chances to review material, so they retain their skills, he said. In September 2006, Tacoma Public Schools introduced the Saxon books district-wide and rejected the previous IMP textbooks.\n\nSaxon Publishers has also published phonics and spelling curriculum. This curriculum, authored by Lorna Simmons and first published in 2005, follows the same incremental principles as the Saxon Math curriculum.\n\nCurrently, the Saxon Phonics and Spelling curriculum published provides four different levels of materials. The first three levels, starting in Kindergarten and progressing through second grade, offers daily lessons consisting of three main parts: lesson warm-up, new increment, and application and continual review. An assessment tool is included with the teaching materials to show teachers where students may be struggling, and it also provides remediation methods to reiterate the failing concepts. The fourth level of curriculum is intended for the third grade and allows for further advancement in spelling skills. Each level consists of various teaching materials to support the daily lesson plans and remediation factors known of Saxon curriculum. Specifically, the Saxon Phonics and Spelling curricula is \"beneficial for struggling readers because of the structure and repetitive characteristics associated with Saxon Publisher's curriculum.\" \n\nResearch shows that students using the Saxon Phonics and Spelling program showed improvement over a school year in phonics, reading, and spelling. Research has also shown that this program works just as well with males as with females and with special education and non-special education students.\n\nSaxon curriculum remains popular among homeschooling families but is also starting to be incorporated into public schools as well. The repetitive curriculum design provides students with constant reinforcements of previously learned concepts. This routine practice reinforces important topics into the student long-term memory. School districts find this especially beneficial when they need to raise their testing scores in math, phonics, and spelling.\n\nSaxon math textbooks are visible on a table in the film Last Action Hero.\n\n"}

Similarly, RHS is the right-hand side.

The dominant portion of the integral near the saddle point is then approximated by a real integral and Laplace's method, while the remaining portion of the integral can be bounded above to give an error term.\n\nStirling's formula is in fact the first approximation to the following series (now called the Stirling series):\n\nAn explicit formula for the coefficients in this series was given by G.

The property relates to the rate of convergence of sequences of random variables and requires that this rate is essentially the same within a region of the parameter space being considered.\n\nFor instance, stochastic equicontinuity, along with other conditions, can be used to show uniform weak convergence, which can be used to prove the convergence of extremum estimators.\n\nLet formula_1 be a family of random functions defined from formula_2, where formula_3 is any normed metric space.

That is, these numbers are not in the image of the aliquot sum function. Their study goes back at least to Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi (circa 1000 AD), who observed that both 2 and 5 are untouchable.\n\nFor example, the number 4 is not untouchable as it is equal to the sum of the proper divisors of 9: 1 + 3 = 4. The number 5 is untouchable as it is not the sum of the proper divisors of any positive integer: 5 = 1 + 4 is the only way to write 5 as the sum of distinct positive integers including 1, but if 4 divides a number, 2 does also, so 1 + 4 cannot be the sum of all of any number's proper divisors (since the list of factors would have to contain both 4 and 2).\n\nThe first few untouchable numbers are:\n\nThe number 5 is believed to be the only odd untouchable number, but this has not been proven: it would follow from a slightly stronger version of the Goldbach conjecture, since the sum of the proper divisors of \"pq\" (with \"p\", \"q\" distinct primes) is 1+\"p\"+\"q\". Thus, if a number \"n\" can be written as a sum of two distinct primes, then \"n\"+1 is not an untouchable number. It is expected that every even number larger than 6 is a sum of two distinct primes, so probably no odd number larger than 7 is an untouchable number, and formula_1, formula_2, formula_3, so only 5 can be an odd untouchable number. Thus it appears that besides 2 and 5, all untouchable numbers are composite numbers (since except 2, all even numbers are composite). No perfect number is untouchable, since, at the very least, it can be expressed as the sum of its own proper divisors. Similarly, none of the amicable numbers or sociable numbers are untouchable.\n\nNo untouchable number is one more than a prime number, since if \"p\" is prime, then the sum of the proper divisors of \"p\" is \"p\" + 1. Also, no untouchable number is three more than a prime number, except 5, since if \"p\" is an odd prime then the sum of the proper divisors of \"2p\" is \"p\" + 3.\n\nThere are infinitely many untouchable numbers, a fact that was proven by Paul Erdős.

{"id": "33618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33618", "title": "William Paley", "text": "William Paley\n\nWilliam Paley (July 1743 – 25 May 1805) was an English clergyman, Christian apologist, philosopher, and utilitarian. He is best known for his natural theology exposition of the teleological argument for the existence of God in his work \"Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity\", which made use of the watchmaker analogy.\n\nPaley was born in Peterborough, England, and was educated at Giggleswick School, of which his father was headmaster, and at Christ's College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1763 as senior wrangler, became fellow in 1766, and in 1768 tutor of his college. He lectured on Samuel Clarke, Joseph Butler and John Locke in his systematic course on moral philosophy, which subsequently formed the basis of his \"Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy\"; and on the New Testament, his own copy of which is in the British Library. The sub controversy was then agitating the university, and Paley pushed an anonymous defence of a pamphlet in which the Master of Peterhouse and Bishop of Carlisle Edmund Law had advocated the retrenchment and simplification of the Thirty-nine Articles; he did not, however, sign the petition (called the \"Feathers Tavern\" petition, from the place where it was agreed) for a relaxation of the terms of subscription. He was also a strong supporter of the American colonies during the revolutionary war, partly because he thought it would lead to the destruction of slavery. He studied philosophy.\n\nIn 1776 Paley was presented to the rectory of Musgrave in Westmorland, which was exchanged soon after for Appleby. He was subsequently made vicar of Dalston in 1780, near the bishop's palace at Rose Castle. In 1782 he became the Archdeacon of Carlisle. Paley was intimate with the Law family throughout his life, and the Bishop and his son John Law (who was later an Irish bishop) were instrumental during the decade after he left Cambridge in pressing him to publish his revised lectures and in negotiating with the publisher. In 1782 Edmund Law, otherwise the mildest of men, was most particular that Paley should add a book on political philosophy to the moral philosophy, which Paley was reluctant to write. The book was published in 1785 under the title of \"The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy\", and was made a part of the examinations at the University of Cambridge the next year. It passed through fifteen editions in the author's lifetime. Paley strenuously supported the abolition of the slave trade, and his attack on slavery in the book was instrumental in drawing greater public attention to the practice. In 1789, a speech he gave on the subject in Carlisle was published.\n\nThe \"Principles\" was followed in 1790 by his first essay in the field of Christian apologetics, \"Horae Paulinae, or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul\" which compared the Paul's Epistles with the Acts of the Apostles, making use of \"undesigned coincidences\" to argue that these documents mutually supported each other's authenticity. Some have said this book was the most original of Paley's works. It was followed in 1794 by the celebrated \"View of the Evidences of Christianity\", which was also added to the examinations at Cambridge, remaining on the syllabus until the 1920s.\n\nFor his services in defence of the faith, with the publication of the \"Evidences\", the Bishop of London gave him a stall in St Paul's; the Bishop of Lincoln made him subdean of that cathedral, and the Bishop of Durham conferred upon him the rectory of Bishopwearmouth. During the remainder of Paley's life, his time was divided between Bishopwearmouth and Lincoln, during which time he wrote \"Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity\", despite his increasingly debilitating illness. He died on 25 May 1805 and is buried in Carlisle Cathedral with his two wives. His second son was the architect Edward Graham Paley and his grandson was the classical scholar Frederick Apthorp Paley.\n\nPaley's \"Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy\" was one of the most influential philosophical texts in late Enlightenment Britain. It was cited in several parliamentary debates over the corn laws in Britain and in debates in the US Congress. The book remained a set textbook at Cambridge well into the Victorian era. Charles Darwin, as a student of theology, was required to read it when he did his undergraduate studies at Christ's College, but it was Paley's \"Natural Theology\" that most impressed Darwin even though it was not a set book for undergraduates. Portraits of Paley and Darwin face each other at Christ's College to this day.\nPaley is also remembered for his contributions to the philosophy of religion, utilitarian ethics and Christian apologetics. In 1802, he published \"Natural Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity\", his last book. As he states in the preface, he saw the book as a preamble to his other philosophical and theological books; in fact, he suggests that \"Natural Theology\" should be read first, so as to build a systematic understanding of his arguments. The main thrust of his argument was that God's design of the whole creation could be seen in the general happiness, or well-being, that was evident in the physical and social order of things. Such a book fell within the broad tradition of natural theology works written during the Enlightenment; and this explains why Paley based much of his thought on John Ray (1691), William Derham (1711) and Bernard Nieuwentyt (1750).\n\nPaley's argument is built mainly around anatomy and natural history. \"For my part\", he says, \"I take my stand in human anatomy\"; elsewhere he insists upon \"the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent designing mind for the contriving and determining of the forms which organized bodies bear\". In making his argument, Paley employed a wide variety of metaphors and analogies. Perhaps the most famous is his analogy between a watch and the world. Historians, philosophers and theologians often call this the Watchmaker analogy. Building on this mechanical analogy, Paley presents examples from planetary astronomy and argues that the regular movements of the solar system resemble the workings of a giant clock. To bolster his views he cites the work of his old friend John Law and the Dublin Astronomer Royal John Brinkley.\n\nThe germ of the idea is to be found in ancient writers who used sundials and Ptolemaic epicycles to illustrate the divine order of the world. These types of examples can be seen in the work of the ancient philosopher Cicero, especially in his \"De natura deorum\", ii. 87 and 97. The watch analogy was widely used in the Enlightenment, by deists and Christians alike. Thus, Paley's use of the watch (and other mechanical objects like it) continued a long and fruitful tradition of analogical reasoning that was well received by those who read \"Natural Theology\" when it was published in 1802.\n\nSince Paley is often read in university courses that address the philosophy of religion, the timing of his design argument has sometimes perplexed modern philosophers. Earlier in the century David Hume had argued against notions of design with counter examples drawn from monstrosity, imperfect forms of testimony and probability (see watchmaker analogy). Hume's arguments, however, were not widely accepted by most of the reading public and they fell 'stillborn' (to use Hume's own assessment) from the press. Despite Hume's unpopularity, Paley's published works and in manuscript letters show that he engaged directly with Hume from his time as an undergraduate to his last works. Paley's works were more influential than Hume's from the 1800s to the 1840s. Hume's arguments were only accepted gradually by the reading public, and his philosophical works sold poorly until agnostics like Thomas Huxley championed Hume's philosophy in the late 19th century.\n\nScientific norms have changed greatly since Paley's day, and are inclined to do less than justice to his arguments and ways of reasoning. But his style is lucid and he was willing to present transparently the evidence against his own case. The design argument has also been applied in other fields of scientific and philosophical inquiry, notably in regards to anthropic cosmological fine-tuning, fine-tuning for discoverability and the origin of life. His subject matter was central to Victorian anxieties, which might be one reason \"Natural Theology\" continued to appeal to the reading public, making his book a best seller for most of the 19th century, even after the publication of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" in 1859. \"Natural Theology\" and the \"Evidences of Christianity\" appealed to Victorian Evangelicals, although not so much to adherents of the Oxford Movement – and both found his \"utilitarianism\" objectionable. Paley's views influenced (both positively and negatively) theologians, philosophers and scientists, then and since.\n\nIn addition to \"Moral and Political Philosophy\" and the \"Evidences\", Charles Darwin read \"Natural Theology\" during his student years, and later stated in his autobiography that he was initially convinced by the argument. His views changed with time. By the 1820s and 1830s, well-known liberals like Thomas Wakley and other radical editors of \"The Lancet\" were using Paley's ageing examples to attack the establishment's control over medical and scientific education in Durham, London, Oxford and Cambridge. It also inspired the Earl of Bridgewater to commission the \"Bridgewater Treatises\" and the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge to issue cheap reprints for the rising middle class. But whereas Paley's natural theology was disassembled or rebuilt by intellectuals like Wakley or the Bridgewater authors, the core of argument retained an ongoing popularity with the reading public and served as the basis of many catechisms and textbooks that were used in Britain and its colonies until World War II when, as argued by Matthew Daniel Eddy, the existential morass of World War I undermined the moral teleology that had underpinned natural theology since the Enlightenment.\n\nToday, Paley's name evokes both reverence and revulsion and his work is cited accordingly by authors seeking to frame their own views of design. Even Richard Dawkins, an opponent of the \"design argument\", described himself as a \"neo-Paleyan\" in \"The Blind Watchmaker\". Today, as in his own time (though for different reasons), Paley is a controversial figure, a lightning rod for both sides in the contemporary argument between science and religion. His writings reflect the thought of his time, but as Dawkins observed, his was a strong and logical approach to evidence, whether human or natural. Perhaps this explains why the Oxford constitutional theorist A.V. Dicey had his pupils read the \"Evidences\" to teach them about legal reasoning. It is for such reasons that Paley's writings, \"Natural Theology\" included, stand as a notable body of work in the canon of Western thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
