Naturally, the terminology evolved. \nAn argument, more fully a premise-conclusion argument, is a two-part system composed of premises and conclusion. An argument is \"valid\" if and only if its conclusion is a consequence of its premises. Every premise set has infinitely many consequences each giving rise to a valid argument. Some consequences are obviously so but most are not: most are hidden consequences. Most valid arguments are not yet known to be valid. To determine validity in non-obvious cases deductive reasoning is required. There is no deductive reasoning in an argument \"per se\"; such must come from the outside. \n\nEvery argument's conclusion is a premise of other arguments. The word \"constituent\" may be used for either a premise or conclusion.In the context of this article and in most classical contexts, all candidates for consideration as argument constituents fall under the category of truth-bearer: propositions, statements, sentences, judgments, etc.\n\nA deduction is a three-part system composed of premises, a conclusion, and chain of intermediates — steps of reasoning showing that its conclusion is a consequence of its premises. The reasoning in a deduction is by definition cogent. Such reasoning itself, or the chain of intermediates representing it, has also been called an argument, more fully a deductive argument. In many cases, an argument can be known to be valid by means of a deduction of its conclusion from its premises but non-deductive methods such as Venn diagrams and other graphic procedures have been proposed.\n\nA proof is a deduction whose premises are known truths. A proof of the Pythagorean theorem is a deduction that might use several premises — axioms, postulates, and definitions — and contain dozens of intermediate steps. As Alfred Tarski famously emphasized in accord with Aristotle, truths can be known by proof but proofs presuppose truths not known by proof.\nPremise-conclusion arguments do not require or produce either knowledge of validity or knowledge of truth. Premise sets may be chosen arbitrarily and conclusions may be chosen arbitrarily. \nDeductions require knowing how to reason but they do not require knowledge of truth of their premises. Deductions produce knowledge of the validity of arguments but ordinarily they do not produce knowledge of the truth of their conclusions.\nProofs require knowledge of the truth of their premises, they require knowledge of deductive reasoning, and they produce knowledge of their conclusions.\nModern logicians disagree concerning the nature of argument constituents.Quine devotes the first chapter of \"Philosophy of Logic\" to this issue. Historians have not even been able to agree on what Aristotle took as constituents.\nArgument-deduction-proof distinctions are inseparable from what have been called the \"consequence-deducibility\" distinction and the \"truth-and-consequence conception of proof\". Variations among argument-deduction-proof distinctions are not all terminological.\n\nLogician Alonzo Church never used the word \"argument\" in the above sense and had no synonym. Moreover, Church never explained that deduction is the process of producing knowledge of consequence and it never used the common noun \"deduction\" for an application of the deduction process. His primary focus in discussing proof was “conviction” produced by generation of chains of logical truths—not the much more widely applicable and more familiar general process of demonstration as found in pre-Aristotelian geometry and discussed by Aristotle. He did discuss deductions in the above sense but not by that name: he called them awkwardly “proofs from premises” — an expression he coined for the purpose.\n\nThe absence of argument-deduction-proof distinctions is entirely consonant with Church's avowed Platonistic logicism. Following Dummett's insightful remarks about Frege, which — \"mutatis mutandis\" — apply even more to Church, it might be possible to explain the today-surprising absence.\n"}

In mathematics, association schemes belong to both algebra and combinatorics. Indeed, in algebraic combinatorics, association schemes provide a unified approach to many topics, for example combinatorial designs and coding theory. In algebra, association schemes generalize groups, and the theory of association schemes generalizes the character theory of linear representations of groups.\n\nAn n-class association scheme consists of a set \"X\" together with a partition \"S\" of \"X\" × \"X\" into n + 1 binary relations, R, R, ..., R which satisfy:\n\n\nAn association scheme is \"commutative\" if formula_13 for all formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10. Most authors assume this property.\n\nA \"symmetric\" association scheme is one in which each relation formula_17 is a symmetric relation. That is:\n\n\nEvery symmetric association scheme is commutative.\n\nNote, however, that while the notion of an association scheme generalizes the notion of a group, the notion of a commutative association scheme only generalizes the notion of a commutative group.\n\nTwo points \"x\" and \"y\" are called \"i\" th associates if formula_18. The definition states that if \"x\" and \"y\" are \"i\" th associates so are \"y\" and \"x\". Every pair of points are \"i\" th associates for exactly one formula_8. Each point is its own zeroth associate while distinct points are never zeroth associates. If \"x\" and \"y\" are \"k\" th associates then the number of points formula_20 which are both \"i\" th associates of formula_11 and \"j\" th associates of formula_12 is a constant formula_7.\n\nA symmetric association scheme can be visualized as a complete graph with labeled edges. The graph has formula_24 vertices, one for each point of formula_25, and the edge joining vertices formula_11 and formula_12 is labeled formula_8 if formula_11 and formula_12 are formula_8 th associates. Each edge has a unique label, and the number of triangles with a fixed base labeled formula_10 having the other edges labeled formula_8 and formula_9 is a constant formula_7, depending on formula_36 but not on the choice of the base. In particular, each vertex is incident with exactly formula_37 edges labeled formula_8; formula_39 is the valency of the relation formula_40. There are also loops labeled formula_41 at each vertex formula_11, corresponding to formula_43.\n\nThe relations are described by their adjacency matrices. formula_44 is the adjacency matrix of formula_40 for formula_46 and is a \"v\" × \"v\" matrix with rows and columns labeled by the points of formula_25.\n\nThe definition of a symmetric association scheme is equivalent to saying that the formula_44 are \"v\" × \"v\" (0,1)-matrices which satisfy\n\nThe (\"x\", \"y\")-th entry of the left side of (IV) is the number of paths of length two between \"x\" and \"y\" with labels i and j in the graph. Note that the rows and columns of formula_44 contain formula_39 formula_56's:\n\nformula_57\n\n\nThe term \"association scheme\" is due to but the concept is already inherent in . These authors were studying what statisticians have called \"partially balanced incomplete block designs\" (PBIBDs). The subject became an object of algebraic interest with the publication of and the introduction of the Bose–Mesner algebra. The most important contribution to the theory was the thesis of P. Delsarte who recognized and fully used the connections with coding theory and design theory. Generalizations have been studied by D. G. Higman (coherent configurations) and B. Weisfeiler (distance regular graphs).\n\n\nThe adjacency matrices formula_68 of the graphs formula_69 generate a commutative and associative algebra formula_70 (over the real or complex numbers) both for the matrix product and the pointwise product. This associative, commutative algebra is called the Bose–Mesner algebra of the association scheme.\n\nSince the matrices in formula_70 are symmetric and commute with each other, they can be diagonalized simultaneously. Therefore, formula_70 is semi-simple and has a unique basis of primitive idempotents formula_73.\n\nThere is another algebra of formula_74 matrices which is isomorphic to formula_70, and is often easier to work with.\n\n\nThe Hamming scheme and the Johnson scheme are of major significance in classical coding theory.\n\nIn coding theory, association scheme theory is mainly concerned with the distance of a code. The linear programming method produces upper bounds for the size of a code with given minimum distance, and lower bounds for the size of a design with a given strength. The most specific results are obtained in the case where the underlying association scheme satisfies certain polynomial properties; this leads one into the realm of orthogonal polynomials. In particular, some universal bounds are derived for codes and designs in polynomial-type association schemes.\n\nIn classical coding theory, dealing with codes in a Hamming scheme, the MacWilliams transform involves a family of orthogonal polynomials known as the Krawtchouk polynomials. These polynomials give the eigenvalues of the distance relation matrices of the Hamming scheme.\n\n\n\n"}

More generally, \"U\" and \"V\" can be complex manifolds. As in the case of functions of a single complex variable, a sufficient condition for a holomorphic map to be biholomorphic onto its image is that the map is injective, in which case the inverse is also holomorphic (e.g., see Gunning 1990, Theorem I.11).\n\nIf there exists a biholomorphism formula_5, we say that \"U\" and \"V\" are biholomorphically equivalent or that they are biholomorphic.\n\nIf formula_6 every simply connected open set other than the whole complex plane is biholomorphic to the unit disc (this is the Riemann mapping theorem). The situation is very different in higher dimensions. For example, open unit balls and open unit polydiscs are not biholomorphically equivalent for formula_7 In fact, there does not exist even a proper holomorphic function from one to the other.\n\nIn the case of maps \"f\" : \"U\" → C defined on an open subset \"U\" of the complex plane C, some authors (e.g., Freitag 2009, Definition IV.4.1) define a conformal map to be an injective map with nonzero derivative i.e., \"f\"’(\"z\")≠ 0 for every \"z\" in \"U\". According to this definition, a map \"f\" : \"U\" → C is conformal if and only if \"f\": \"U\" → \"f\"(\"U\") is biholomorphic. Other authors (e.g., Conway 1978) define a conformal map as one with nonzero derivative, without requiring that the map be injective. According to this weaker definition of conformality, a conformal map need not be biholomorphic even though it is locally biholomorphic. For example, if \"f\": \"U\" → \"U\" is defined by \"f\"(\"z\") = \"z\" with \"U\" = C–{0}, then \"f\" is conformal on \"U\", since its derivative \"f\"’(\"z\") = 2\"z\" ≠ 0, but it is not biholomorphic, since it is 2-1.\n\n"}

This object has its own intrinsic coordinate system. As the object moves along the curve, let its intrinsic coordinate system keep itself aligned with the curve's Frenet frame. As it does so, the object's motion will be described by two vectors: a translation vector, and a rotation vector ω, which is an areal velocity vector: the Darboux vector.\n\nNote that this rotation is kinematic, rather than physical, because usually when a rigid object moves freely in space its rotation is independent of its translation. The exception would be if the object's rotation is physically constrained to align itself with the object's translation, as is the case with the cart of a roller coaster.\n\nConsider the rigid object moving smoothly along the regular curve.

The lemma states that if an adversary (typically a probabilistic Turing machine), on inputs drawn from some distribution, produces an output that has some property with non-negligible probability, then with non-negligible probability, if the adversary is re-run on new inputs but with the same random tape, its second output will also have the property.\n\nThis concept was first used by David Pointcheval and Jacques Stern in \"Security proofs for signature schemes,\" published in the proceedings of Eurocrypt 1996. In their paper, the forking lemma is specified in terms of an adversary that attacks a digital signature scheme instantiated in the random oracle model. They show that if an adversary can forge a signature with non-negligible probability, then there is a non-negligible probability that the same adversary with the same random tape can create a second forgery in an attack with a different random oracle. The forking lemma was later generalized by Mihir Bellare and Gregory Neven. The forking lemma has been used to prove the security of a variety of digital signature schemes and other random-oracle based cryptographic constructions.\n\nThe generalized version of the lemma is stated as follows. Let \"A\" be a probabilistic algorithm, with inputs (\"x\", \"h\", ..., \"h\"; \"r\") that outputs a pair (\"J\", \"y\"), where \"r\" refers to the random tape of \"A\" (that is, the random choices A will make).

In the alternate version, the remaining inputs are re-generated but are generated in the normal way. The point at which the process forks may be something we only want to decide later, possibly based on the behavior of \"A\" the first time around: this is why the lemma statement chooses the branching point (\"J\") based on the output of \"A\". The requirement that \"h\" ≠ \"h'\" is a technical one required by many uses of the lemma. (Note that since both \"h\" and \"h'\" are chosen randomly from \"H\", then if \"h\" is large, which would be normal, the probability of the two values not being distinct is extremely small.)\n\nFor example, let \"A\" be an algorithm for breaking a digital signature scheme in the random oracle model. Then \"x\" would be the public parameters (including the public key) \"A\" is attacking, and \"h\" would be the output of the random oracle on its \"i\"th distinct input. The forking lemma is of use when it would be possible, given two different random signatures of the same message, to solve some underlying hard problem. An adversary that forges once, however, gives rise to one that forges twice on the same message with non-negligible probability through the forking lemma. When \"A\" attempts to forge on a message \"m\", we consider the output of \"A\" to be (\"J\", \"y\") where \"y\" is the forgery, and \"J\" is such that \"m\" was the \"J\"th unique query to the random oracle (it may be assumed that \"A\" will query \"m\" at some point, if \"A\" is to be successful with non-negligible probability). (If \"A\" outputs an incorrect forgery, we consider the output to be (0, \"y\").)\n\nBy the forking lemma, the probability (\"frk\") of obtaining two good forgeries \"y\" and \"y' \" on the same message but with different random oracle outputs (that is, with \"h ≠ h'\") is non-negligible when \"acc\" is also non-negligible. This allows us to prove that if the underlying hard problem is indeed hard, then no adversary can forge signatures.\n\nThis is the essence of the proof given by Pointcheval and Stern for a modified ElGamal signature scheme against an adaptive adversary.\n\nThe reduction provided by the forking lemma is not a tight reduction. Pointcheval and Stern proposed security arguments for Digital Signatures and Blind Signature using Forking Lemma. Claus P. Schnorr provided an attack on blind Schnorr signatures schemes, which were argued to be secure by Pointcheval and Stern. Schnorr also suggested enhancements for securing blind signatures schemes based on discrete logarithm problem.\n"}

Usually, the energy bound is achieved by considering a symplectic manifold with compatible almost-complex structure as the target, and assuming that curves to lie in a fixed homology class in the target. This is because the energy of such a pseudoholomorphic curve is given by the integral of the target symplectic form over the curve, and thus by evaluating the cohomology class of that symplectic form on the homology class of the curve. The finiteness of the bubble tree follows from (positive) lower bounds on the energy contributed by a holomorphic sphere.\n"}

The pair formula_28 is then called a \"Hahn decomposition\" of the signed measure formula_2.\n\nA consequence of the Hahn decomposition theorem is the Jordan decomposition theorem, which states that every signed measure formula_2 defined on formula_4 has a \"unique\" decomposition into a difference formula_32 of two positive measures, formula_33 and formula_34, at least one of which is finite, such that formula_35 for every formula_4-measurable subset formula_17 and formula_38 for every formula_4-measurable subset formula_12, for any Hahn decomposition formula_28 of formula_2.

It states that any smooth conformal mapping on a domain of R, where \"n\" > 2, can be expressed as a composition of translations, similarities, orthogonal transformations and inversions: they are Möbius transformations (in \"n\" dimensions). This theorem severely limits the variety of possible conformal mappings in R and higher-dimensional spaces. By contrast, conformal mappings in R can be much more complicated – for example, all simply connected planar domains are conformally equivalent, by the Riemann mapping theorem.\n\nGeneralizations of the theorem hold for transformations that are only weakly differentiable . The focus of such a study is the non-linear Cauchy–Riemann system that is a necessary and sufficient condition for a smooth mapping \"ƒ\" → Ω → R to be conformal:\nwhere \"Df\" is the Jacobian derivative, \"T\" is the matrix transpose, and \"I\" is the identity matrix. A weak solution of this system is defined to be an element \"ƒ\" of the Sobolev space \"W\"(\"Ω\",R) with non-negative Jacobian determinant almost everywhere, such that the Cauchy–Riemann system holds at almost every point of Ω. Liouville's theorem is then that every weak solution (in this sense) is a Möbius transformation, meaning that it has the form\nwhere \"a\",\"b\" are vectors in R, α is a scalar, \"A\" is a rotation matrix, and ε = 0 or 2. Equivalently stated, any quasiconformal map of a domain in Euclidean space that is also conformal is a Möbius transformation. This equivalent statement justifies using the Sobolev space \"W\", since \"ƒ\" ∈ \"W\"(\"Ω\",R) then follows from the geometrical condition of conformality and the ACL characterization of Sobolev space. The result is not optimal however: in even dimensions \"n\" = 2\"k\", the theorem also holds for solutions that are only assumed to be in the space \"W\", and this result is sharp in the sense that there are weak solutions of the Cauchy–Riemann system in \"W\" for any \"p\" < \"k\" which are not Möbius transformations. In odd dimensions, it is known that \"W\" is not optimal, but a sharp result is not known.\n\nSimilar rigidity results (in the smooth case) hold on any conformal manifold. The group of conformal isometries of an \"n\"-dimensional conformal Riemannian manifold always has dimension that cannot exceed that of the full conformal group SO(\"n\"+1,1). Equality of the two dimensions holds exactly when the conformal manifold is isometric with the \"n\"-sphere or projective space. Local versions of the result also hold: The Lie algebra of conformal Killing fields in an open set has dimension less than or equal to that of the conformal group, with equality holding if and only if the open set is locally conformally flat.\n\n"}

{"id": "8084968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8084968", "title": "Numbertime", "text": "Numbertime\n\nNumbertime is a BBC educational numeracy television series for primary schools that was aired on BBC Two from 20 September 1993 to 3 December 2001. For its first four series, it was presented by Lolita Chakrabarti. El Nombre, an animated character from \"Numbertime\", eventually became the concept for another educational BBC children's television program; his name means \"The Name\" in Spanish, and not \"The Number\", which would be \"El Número\". The third line of his opening song and his farewell catchphrase were also changed several times during the series' run, to reflect their focus - however, the original ones (\"Writing numbers in the desert sand\" which was also used for the seventh series, and \"Adios amigos, and keep counting\" which was also used for the fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth series) remain the most famous.\n\nFor the second series, El Nombre's tagline and farewell catchphrase were changed to \"Drawing shapes in the desert sand\" and \"Adios amigos, and keep shaping up\" respectively, while for the third series, they were changed to \"Righting wrongs in the desert sand\" and \"Adios amigos, over and out\" respectively; however, for the fourth series, his tagline was changed to \"Counting numbers in the desert sand\" (which was also used for the ninth series), and for the third episode of the fourth series, his farewell catchphrase was changed to \"Adios amigos, and fetch some water\". For the fifth series, both his tagline and farewell catchphrase were changed to \"Telling time in the desert sand\" and \"Adios amigos, 'till the next time\" respectively, while for the sixth series, his tagline was changed to \"Using numbers in the desert sand\"; finally, for the eighth series, his tagline was changed to \"Counting money in the desert sand\".\n\nThe first series, which is aimed at four- to five-year-olds, comprised ten episodes focusing on the numbers 1-10, in order; each episode opened with Lolita introducing herself to the viewer, and pulling the number for the episode off its string (which was hanging from the studio ceiling), then pushing it into its correct hole in a wall, and singing the main theme, \"One to Ten\", as each of its holes lit up in turn, which was repeated throughout the programme. In between, there were comedy sketches (mostly based on nursery rhymes), and animations, the most famous involving El Nombre, the Mexican gerbil who parodied Zorro, showing little Juan how to draw numbers as his four-piece mariachi band played \"The Mexican Hat Dance\" (and said \"Again!\" once he had finished, as it gave them an excuse to play again), and a sequence encouraging the viewer to spot things of the number for each episode - it was the same video, with a different number of things each time (and a recurring song, \"Numbers All Around\", which was sung by a group of children). Each episode ended with Lolita singing a song (or occasionally, introducing an animation), after which she would set viewers the challenge of looking for things in the number of the week's episode before saying that she would \"see them next Numbertime\".\n\nThis series was originally aired on Mondays as part of the \"Daytime on Two\" strand at 9:45am, and repeated at 2:00pm on the same day; in Scotland, the 2:00pm repeats were replaced with broadcasts of BBC Scotland's own schools series \"Over the Moon with Mr. Boom\".\n\nThe Narrator proudly presents \"Nursery Rhyme Theatre No. 1 - Little Miss Muffet\" with several interruptions, and Little Jack Horner has one minute to \"Find 1 Plum\" on Sammy Sallow's game show of the same name; if he succeeds, he can choose one prize - one mountain bike, or one computer, or one picture of Sallow. This episode also ends with \"One Finger, One Thumb, Keep Moving\", which is sung by the group of children who sang \"Numbers All Around\" earlier on in it.\n\n\nThe Narrator introduces \"Nursery Rhyme Theatre No. 2\" with Marvo the Magician (and his Two Amazing Dickey Birds), and Sammy Sport reports on Jack and Jill's attempt to break the world record for the fastest time to run up a hill, fill a pail with water, and take it back down the hill again (under 2 minutes); this episode also ends with Lolita singing \"The Animals Went in Two by Two\".\n\n\nSammy Sport is joined by Baa-Baa Black Sheep for the results of the \"Win a Bag of Wool\" competition, while Goldilocks invites viewers to \"Guess Whose House\" (for Sammy Sallow's game show of the same name); the Numbertime Top Ten also brings the viewers, at No. 3, the ever-popular \"Three-Sided Triangles\", who sing an original song named \"We're Triangles (Oh Yes We Are)\".\n\n\nFarmer Giles introduces the finals of \"One Girl and Her Sheep\" at which Little Bo Peep and her dog Shep are competing, and the Knave of Hearts talks to the Queen of Hearts about her famous royal tarts; Lolita also tells the viewers to \"grab their partners and take the floor\" as she introduces a quartet of dancing squares, who sing an original song named \"Do the Square Dance\".\n\n\nAustralian chef Wally Bee (and his assistant, Bruce) attempt to show the viewers how to cook five fat sausages on a barbecue for \"Barbecue Time\", and Harry Headline pays a visit to the home of the Five Pigs Family for \"Five Minutes' Fame\"; Little Juan also has his 5th birthday in this episode's \"El Nombre\" sketch, and this episode ends with Lolita singing \"Fly, Little Dickey Birds, Round and Round\".\n\n\nA gardener named Fred enlists the help of his family in pulling up his enormous turnip for \"Garden Time\", and Mr. and Mrs. Jones have to \"Take 6 Eggs\" on Sammy Sallow's game show of the same name and put them on either side of a seesaw to make it balance, for which they have three attempts to do so; this episode also ends with Lolita singing \"This Old Man\" in voiceover.\n\n\nSammy Sport travels to Scotland to see a remarkable fishing contest between the famous Seven Fat Fishermen, to see which one of them can catch the biggest fish, and ordering seven lots of fish and chips turns out to be more trouble than it is worth for the Shopkeeper and his Customer (who has got seven children, and they all want fish and chips); this episode also ends with Lolita singing \"In My Little Garden, Now Promise You Won't Laugh\" (also known as \"One Potato, Two Potato\").\n\n\nSammy Sport travels down to Shoeburyness to interview the Old Woman who Lives in a Shoe (who has 8 children), and the Policeman enlists the viewers' help in finding Wee Willie Winkie for \"Crime Spot\"; it is also evening in Little Juan's town in this episode's \"El Nombre\" sketch, and this episode ends with Lolita imagining what the world would be like if everything was eight-shaped as she visits the Planet of the Eights to sing an original song about it (and this is the only occasion in this series that she is not seen in her usual purple outfit, but a silver spacesuit).\n\n\nLucky the Cat looks back over her nine lives, as she guests on \"This Is My Life\", and Harry Headline comes to the garden of Miss Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary, to look at the wonderful display of flowers for \"Garden Time\"; unfortunately, he ruins her chances of winning their \"Best Flowers Competition\", and she ends up coming ninth. This was also the only episode for this series to not end with a song - instead, Lolita shows the viewers a homemade necklace which has nine beads (three red, three blue, and three yellow), in reference to the episode's third animated sketch.\n\n\nFarmer Giles (and his dog, Scruff) show viewers a wonderful, new, and very quick way to mow a meadow for \"Farming News\", and Sammy Sport travels to Ten Pin Alley to watch Ten Pin Pete attempt to become the new Ten Pin Champ; Lolita also shows the viewers ten Russian dolls, and this episode ends with \"Ten in the Bed\" (which is, again, sung by the group of children who sang \"Numbers All Around\" earlier on in it). Also, because this episode was the last in the series, Lolita did not tell the viewers that she would \"see them next Numbertime\".\n\n\nIn 1994, BBC Enterprises (now BBC Worldwide) released a video entitled \"Number Time\" (BBCV 5359, and spelled with two words), containing sixty minutes of edited highlights from this series (it was the only one at the time); it was later rereleased as the second half of a \"two-on-one\" video in 1997 with the \"Words and Pictures\" \"Alphabet Fun Time\" video (BBCV 5357), which had originally been released at around the same time and contained fifty-eight minutes of highlights from that show's 1992 series (the \"two-on-one\" video in question was entitled \"Alphabet Fun Time and Number Time\", BBCV 5987, and it was rereleased in 1999). This series was later re-released in full as a \"Video Plus Pack\" in 1996 - only slightly altered to remove the episodes' opening titles.\n\nFrom 22 September to 1 December 1998, the BBC broadcast a \"revised\" version of this series as a lead-in to the sixth series; in place of Lolita, Bill (introduced in the fourth series) and Bernie (who joined him in the fifth one) introduced each episode with a number line of their own (however, Lolita's voice was still heard narrating some re-used animated sketches). All except six of the original live-action sketches were replaced with Dolls' House (again, see Series 5) ones - and the \"El Nombre\" sketches were slightly lengthened. Sequences of children discussing the ten numbers (in the vein of those discussing the time-related concepts covered by the fifth series) were also introduced; although the \"Planet of the Eights\" sketch was also re-used, the vocal track was redubbed and Lolita was edited out of it.\n\nThe second series, which is again aimed at four- to five-year-olds, comprised five episodes, focusing on the four basic two-dimensional shapes; each episode would open with Lolita standing by a mobile with the four basic shapes hanging from it and singing the series' main theme, \"Squares and Triangles, Circles and Rectangles\" as the mobile began to turn. Once it had stopped turning, she would walk over to the shape that was nearest to her, then ask the viewers if they knew what it was, before it lit up and she told them - and from this series onwards, El Nombre was given \"two\" sketches per episode (the first to show Juan instances of that week's shape around the town, with Juan being clumsy and getting confronted by the other villagers after El Nombre had left, and the second to draw it in the desert sand). This series also featured four cut-out animated characters made up from the shapes its episodes were focusing on (a circular man with magical powers, a square robot with transformation powers, a triangular knight with a magical lance and a rectangular man); in the last episode, they worked together to build a house (after the rectangular man built one entirely out of rectangles, and the square robot, triangular knight and circular man transformed them into their own shapes). Each episode would end with Lolita singing an \"extended\" version of a song that had been heard earlier in the episode during a montage of the shape around the real world (for the last one, she continued over the credits) and setting viewers the challenge of seeing how many of that week's shape they could find before the next episode.\n\nThe first two episodes of this series were, again, originally aired as part of the \"Daytime on Two\" strand on Mondays at 9:45am, but 8 May 1995 was the year's May Day, so its third episode was aired the following day; the last two episodes were also aired on Mondays.\n\nEl Nombre shows Juan what a circle is (with a cart's wheel, a hoopla ring and a hoop with its stick), while a man named Terry introduces the world-famous \"Ring a Ring o' Roses Formation Dance Team\" (and their manager, Cynthia) on \"Come Prancing\", and a prehistoric couple try to invent the round wheel (after the square and triangular ones) for their car for \"Great Moments in History\"; also, in this episode's second cut-out animated sketch, circular pawprints transform into a circular ladybird, a circular bird, a circular caterpillar (that becomes a circular butterfly), a circular fish which blows circular bubbles, a circular car which emits circular smoke from its circular exhaust, a circular man's head, and a circular bear (and in its CGI animated sketch, a circle gains two additional planes and proceeds to transform into a beach ball, a football, an orange and the planet Earth).\n\n\nEl Nombre shows Juan what a square is (with the then-unnamed Pedro and Juanita's frame, the then-also-unnamed Señor Manuel and Señor Chipito's draughts board, The Maggot and Cactus saloon's sign and a blackboard), while Bobby Cube asks the Shape Spotters on \"Let's Shape Up\" to name the square by pointing out its distinguishing features, a square robot builds a square dog (which turns on him after catching his scent, but he scares it away by transforming into a much bigger square dog with a big square that he runs to and climbs up), and Jill Scoop reports on Old King Cole who is wanting his square bowl (after round, triangular and rectangular ones) for \"Newsdesk\"; also, for this episode's CGI animated sketch, the yellow square in the bottom-right of a gameboard rises out of it to become a cube and has the numbers 1-6 written on each of its sides (which proceed to transform into six groups of dots of those respective amounts as the cube becomes the dice in a game of \"Snakes and Ladders\").\n\n\nEl Nombre shows Juan what a triangle is (with a musical triangle, a roadworks sign and a stepladder), while Aladdin finds the lamp with a triangle on it (after the ones with a circle and square on them) for his Uncle Abanazer, but he wastes its three wishes (one for each of the triangle's sides and corners) by turning Abanazer into a cat, and himself into a mouse, as well as making it disappear (which causes Abanazer to turn on him, but they both questioned why there was not a Genie in the lamp when asked); a triangular knight also sets out to slay a triangular dragon (but gets burned to a crisp the first attempt, and gets rained on along with the triangular dragon's fire getting put out the second attempt) while Bobby Cube asks the Shape Spotters on \"Let's Shape Up\" (who are the same ones from the previous episode, but have swapped positions) to identify the triangle (again, by pointing out its distinguishing features to them). Also, for this episode's CGI animated sketch, a triangle has a dotted line drawn inside it, then folds up to become a triangular-based pyramid, and rotates to show the numbers 1-4 on its sides as they light up before unfolding back into a triangle again.\n\n\nEl Nombre shows Juan what a rectangle is (with a plank of wood, the cart's side and the then-still-unnamed Pedro and Juanita's piece of cardboard), while Sammy Shape pays a visit to Old Mother Hubbard's cottage to find out \"what makes a rectangle a rectangle\" for \"Shapewatch\" (which, like the \"Crime Spot\" sketch from the previous series, is a spoof of \"Crimewatch\") and met by her dog (who, as in the nursery rhyme, wants a bone, but they find a rectangular biscuit instead), a rectangular man goes for a swim at a swimming pool (after walking up a staircase, taking an elevator and walking up another staircase), Humpty Dumpty is asked to identify the shape of one of the bricks in the wall he is sitting on (which he does just before he falls), and a woman named Jane keeps in touch with her grandmother by writing a rectangular letter, posting it into a postbox which has a rectangular slot and door, then arriving at her house after she receives it.\n\n\nEl Nombre helps Juan remember which shape is which (with the square frame, the circular hoop with its stick, a rectangular book and the triangular roadworks sign), while the rectangular man, the square robot, the triangular knight, and the circular man (who now has a circular body and a wheel for a foot) work together to build a house (after the rectangular man built one entirely out of rectangles, and the square robot, triangular knight and circular man transformed them into their own shapes) and show that \"all different shapes work well together\", Bobby Cube asks the Shape Spotters on \"Let's Shape Up\" to identify the \"Shy Shapes\" hiding in a cola can and Battenberg cake, and a rectangle folds up to become a hollow cylinder as two circles cover its ends and a second rectangle wraps itself around it as it becomes a can of baked beans; also, in this episode's second \"El Nombre\" sketch, Juan draws \"El Nombre\" (a square, rectangle, circle, and triangle stacked on top of each other), before drawing \"the rope that hits him on the head and knocks him over\". El Nombre then says that it has never happened to him - so Juan swings a rope at him, and tells him \"It has now!\". The sombrero-less El Nombre then chases Juan through the streets of the town to an extended version of his theme song (with the new tagline \"Drawing shapes in the desert sand\" at the end), but he never catches him; this is also the only old-style episode to only have one live-action sketch in it (rather than two or three).\n\n\nIn 1996, both this series and the next series were released on VHS as \"Video Plus Packs\" by BBC Educational Publishing (now BBC Active); the following year, they were also rereleased together as a double \"Video Plus Pack\" named \"Numbertime Shapes/Side by Side\".\n\nAfter the corporate change in 1997, BBC Education's then-current Internet address (<nowiki>http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/</nowiki>) was superimposed onto the four shapes (a red circle, a green triangle, a yellow square and a blue rectangle) seen at the end of this series' episodes, as well as the thirteen episodes of the next two series; however, it was never added to the end of the first series' episodes.\n\nThe third series (which is, once again, aimed at four- to five-year-olds) comprised five episodes, focusing on concepts of space and position; each episode would open with Lolita singing the series' main theme, \"Under, Over, Everywhere\" (the mobile from the previous series was also visible in the background, but it now had an apple, three stickmen, a rainbow, a cloud with a hot-air balloon, a sun, a snake, a spider and a snail hanging from it). In this series, Juan gained three new friends named Pedro Gonzales, Juanita Conchita, and Maria Consuela Tequila Chiquita (Pedro and Juanita had also previously appeared in the second series), as well as a pet tarantula named Tanto - and each episode would end with Lolita reciting a rhyme or singing a song (but the one of the second episode was an extended version of one that had been heard in voiceover earlier in the episode during an animated sketch about a fox). A sketch in the second episode of this series also parodied \"EastEnders\" as \"GreenGrocers\"; this was also the first series to credit the \"El Nombre\" voice actors at the end of its last episode (Sophie Aldred, who had played Ace on \"Doctor Who\" as well as one of the presenters of \"Words and Pictures\", \"Spitting Image\" impressionist Kate Robbins, who had also voiced Jemima Wellington-Green on \"Round the Bend\", and Steve Steen, who had played Lord Byron in \"Ink and Incapability\", the second episode of \"Blackadder the Third\"). Although this series was made in Autumn 1995, it was not broadcast until 28 February 1996.\n\nThis series and the next one were originally aired on Wednesdays in the \"Daytime on Two\" strand at 10:25am; this series also premiered after a rerun of the second one finished, and the next one premiered when \"Daytime on Two\" returned after a two-week Easter break.\n\nJuan does not have anything to do for the school concert so El Nombre tells him that he can recite \"Incy Wincy Spider\" with Tanto, a bear flies a kite (but it comes down in a tree, so he has to climb it to retrieve it), a window cleaner is annoyed by the incompetence of her colleague, Juan recites \"Incy Wincy Spider\" at the school concert (but Tanto will not come down the drainpipe, so El Nombre has to coax him) and three clowns named Boris, Doris and Ethel compete to see which one can raise the biggest laugh in \"Give Us a Giggle\".\n\n\nJuan wants to take a photograph of himself and Mama together (but cannot because he is behind the Polaroid), an engine driver pulls some wagons behind (but the coupling snaps when he goes up a hill, so when they roll back down they are in front of him, and he has to signal for the driver of a second engine to help him), Jack and Jill must take Farmer Giles's horse and cart to market in \"Happy Ever After\", a fox hides in his secret lair to escape a hunt (accompanied by a rhyme from Lolita in voiceover), Juan still does not have a photograph of himself and Mama together (so El Nombre takes it himself and blows himself up in the process), and the proprietor of \"GreenGrocers\" tries to get his four customers of the day to stand behind his stall and form a proper queue (until he gets upstaged by a toy salesman).\n\n\nJuan cannot score a goal past Pedro so El Nombre (who is not seen in his usual outfit in this episode, but what would later become Santo Flamingo United's strip) tells him to kick the ball over him, Princess Perfect wants a bed fit for a princess (in the sense of not being able to feel a pea under the mattress), a tortoise named Toby goes to a party but cannot get over the hedge to it (unlike the four other guests of a bird, a frog, a squirrel and a rabbit, but the last of them tells him to go under the hedge instead), Pedro is standing on a stool so Juan again cannot score past him (until El Nombre tells him to kick the ball under him, and when Pedro objects, they reduce the size of the goal, but El Nombre whispers to Juan to kick the ball to one side of Pedro before he leaves), and the Cow (of \"Hey Diddle Diddle\") is scared of having to jump over the Moon (so the Little Dog volunteers the Dish instead, but he suggests running under it).\n\n\nMama wants to go to Hurrell's store but there is a hole in the ground in front of it (so El Nombre and Juan tell her to walk around it), a doll pushes three building blocks with the numbers 1-3 on them together (but a breakdown-truck-driving clown accidentally crashes into them and scatters them, so he has to help her rearrange them again), Darren and Sharon Jam cannot make a mutual decision on where to put their new table on \"Lucky Lottery Winners\", Mama has come out of Hurrell's store (but cannot help thinking there is another way around the hole, so El Nombre tells her that if she is brave like him, she can jump across it, but when he falls down it, she opts to go around it again instead), and Lord and Lady Posh give instructions to their gardener, Jarvis, on where he has to plant their roses and daisies.\n\n\nJuan has lost Tanto so El Nombre helps him and Mama to find him, the bear from the first episode tries to boil a saucepan of water over a fire but its bottom is missing, a magician turns her volunteer's watch and keys into an alarm clock and one big key, and two burglars named Bob and Bert break into a sweet shop and eat all the sweets but grow too fat to escape through the window so they get caught by a policeman named PC Nabb; from this point onwards, El Nombre also returned to one sketch per episode (except for in Episodes 21 and 26).\n\n\nThe fourth series, which is aimed at five- to six-year-olds, comprised eight episodes focusing on the concepts of \"more than\" (addition) and \"less than\" (subtraction); each episode would open with Lolita singing the series' main theme, \"More or Less\", in a studio filled with pillars. This series introduced the character of Bill (voiced by Paul Cawley), a green bird who could swallow and regurgitate almost any object whole - and from the fifth series onwards, he was joined by a purple cat named Bernie (voiced by Laura Brattan). This series also featured a toad named Test, who would hop along the heads of fifteen multicoloured people lined up to form a numberline by the amounts its episodes were focusing on (they all wore red jumpers with the numbers 1-15 on them, but when Test was on their heads, the colour of their jumpers would change to green); each episode would end with Lolita singing a song (for the last one, she again continued over the credits, and it was also her final appearance, but because she did not know that she would be relieved of her presenting duties back then, she still told the viewers that she would \"see them next Numbertime\"). Two sketches in the first and seventh episodes of this series also parodied Percy Thrower and Sir David Attenborough as \"Percy Grower\" and \"David Attencoat\", while a third one in the third episode parodied \"Surprise, Surprise\" as \"What a Surprise\" (with Cinderella receiving a surprise visit from her Fairy Godmother) - and the \"Bill\" sketches of the second and sixth episodes also featured an enormous (but unnamed) beetle who chased after Bill after putting his feet into the eight wellingtons he regurgitated (in the second episode) and fell on top of him after pulling his last two wellingtoned legs up off a wall he was standing in front of (in the sixth episode), while the one of the fourth episode featured a \"female\" version of Bill who fell on top of him after he shook twenty mangoes off a tree. In the \"El Nombre\" sketches of the seventh and last episodes, Juan had his fifth birthday for the second time (only this time, Pedro, Juanita and Maria all brought him an extra candle for his cake because he was one year older, so he ended up with eight), and El Nombre's town gained a female mayor who also happened to be a balloon seller named Señora Fedora.\n\nA little old woman, a little old man and their little old cat enlist the help of one more friend (the Little Old Mouse) to help pull up their enormous turnip for \"Growing Bigger\", Little Juan needs to play two cymbals (not one), Test hops from 3 to 7, contestant Sharon plays \"Find One More\" in order to win two prizes the same, Bill adds four flowers together and Juan needs to hit the cymbals one more time (to make four hits); also, in this episode's second animated sketch, a rather slow butterfly tries to keep up with his much faster friends, but when he joins them on a tree, he causes the branch they are standing on to break under their weight and they all fly away.\n\n\nFreda Fantastic from \"Fantastic Fairytales\" presents \"The Elves and the Shoemaker\", Little Juan and El Nombre juggle with seven of Mama's tomatoes which they shouldn't play with, Test hops from 7 to 13, Fred Fantastic of \"Fantastic Fairytales\" presents \"The Frog Prince\", and Bill adds together eight wellingtons which belong to an enormous beetle (and when the beetle puts his feet into them, he chases after him); also, in this episode's second animated sketch, Noah will not let a mammoth come onto the Ark because there is only one of him, so he disguises himself as a pair of bears with two puppets and a tarpaulin, but he quickly gets discovered by Noah again.\n\n\nA ladybird's nine babies and three extra are saved from a fire that's really smoke from her husband Arnold's barbecue, Little Juan and his friends are about to have Mama's very hot chili with tacos but there are only three chairs, Test hops from 2 to 8, Fairy Godmother presents \"What a Surprise\" with some surprising results for Cinderella, and Bill puts twelve books up on a shelf which ends with the shelf falling down under the books' weight; also, in this episode's second animated sketch, a kiwi notices his (three-toed) footprints in the sand and tries to count them, but finds it too hard to count in threes and eventually gives up by running away from the camera.\n\n\nSnow White goes to the Wild Wood Takeaway and gets seven Good Fairy Cakes (declining cashier Grimbleshanks' first offer, Toad Burgers) for the dwarves' tea as it is Dopey's birthday, Little Juan accidentally blows Juanita's balloon up five more times which then bursts, Test hops from 1 to 11, Jack's mother will not let him climb up the beanstalk as it only has ten leaves on it (and it needs fifteen to get her to change her mind), and Bill shakes twenty mangoes off a tree which ends with a \"female\" version of himself falling on top of him; also, in this episode's second stop-motion animated sketch, a Tyrannosaurus Rex plans to eat a small Triceratops, but gets scared away when five larger Triceratopses, followed up by another five more behind them, suddenly appear behind their friend to protect him.\n\n\nA magician makes six red balls disappear one at a time, Little Juan and his friends play musical chairs but they all have a chair to sit on, Test hops from 12 to 8, Carlotta Bottle tries to sing \"Ten Green Bottles\" but the bottles \"don't-a fall-a\" because property master Reg is not on hand to knock them down, and Bill eats three apples off a tree which ends with the branch he is standing on breaking under his weight and the zero he was displaying hitting him on the head; also, in this episode's second animated sketch, three dogs wait to be picked by prospective new owners at a pet shop (when there is only one remaining, he does a dance with a hat and cane to pass the time).\n\n\nRebecca Testament reports for \"Numbertime News\" and interviews Mr. Noah and one of his sons, Ham, who used to have only six animals on the ark (two elephants, two lions and two doves), Little Juan and Tanto set out to get two melons for Mama's pie (\"Melon Surprise\") as a surprise but Señor Manuel the greengrocer has to save two of his melons for a special customer, Test hops from 10 to 4, a woman wins two coconuts and then another two coconuts from a total of eight on a shy, Bill subtracts six of the enormous beetle's wellingtons (who then falls on top of him), and Little Juan finds out that Señor Manuel's special customer is Mama all along who already has two melons; also, in this episode's second animated sketch, two monkeys get into an argument over two bananas which ends with them falling off their tree.\n\n\nThe Early Bird loses all nine of his worms (and it is all David Attencoat's fault for saying that it isn't raining), Little Juan has his fifth birthday for the second time (but there are more than five candles on his birthday cake), Test hops from 11 to 5, Humpty Dumpty is scared of heights (so the crew members have to take all nine bricks of the wall away three at a time), and Bill watches nine leaves blow off a tree before winter comes, which ends with him being covered in snow; also, in this episode's second animated sketch (the recurring refrain of which is \"Oh, no!\"), three pegs blow off a washing line, three petals fall off three eight-petalled flowers (leaving five), a tricycle hits a stone and all three of its wheels fall off, three sides of a picture frame fall down (leaving one), and three mice steal three biscuits from a plate of eight (leaving five), one of whom only comes back to leave a note in front of the plate saying \"Oh yes!\".\n\n\nThe magician from the fifth episode now makes fifteen beads disappear under three beakers five at a time, Little Juan almost floats away with six of Señora Fedora's balloons, Test hops from 13 to 3, Simple Simon has to find a penny for five of the Pieman's fifteen pies but they have all been sold to Old Mother Hubbard, Little Jack Horner and the Queen of Hearts by the time he does, and Bill recycles fifteen glass bottles (five green, five clear and five brown); also, in this episode's second animated sketch, an enormous snail eats a total of twenty trees from four gardens, and scares away a much smaller snail, a goat, a cow and a flock of birds as he descends on each of them.\n\n\nIn 1997, this series was released on VHS as a \"Video Plus Pack\" by BBC Educational Publishing, and on 16 May 2013 it was rereleased on DVD as a \"DVD Plus Pack\" by BBC Active (as they are now known) with an accompanying teachers' book, but it is now out of print.\n\nThe fifth series, which is aimed at four- to six-year-olds, comprised ten episodes focusing on time-related concepts; given that Lolita had been relieved of her presenting duties by this point, each episode was introduced by an animated man with a pocket watch for a head (who also appeared in a musical sketch at the end of the sixth episode). In this series, El Nombre's town was given the name of Santo Flamingo (its name was first heard in the sixth episode in reference to their local football team, although the sign above the doorway of its newly built school read \"San Flamingo School\"), and Juan gained a new teacher named Constanza Bonanza - and all except two of the episodes had sketches featuring a rarely speaking man named Tim (played by Toby Jones) who was coming to an understanding with time-related concepts (in fact, the only time he spoke was in the seventh episode, when he read out the text \"Cook for half an hour\" on the box of a big pie he had bought). This series also introduced the recurring sketch of the Dolls' House, which featured a cowgirl named Annie (played by Victoria Gay), a scarecrow named Scrap (played by Paul Cawley), a robot named Glimmer (played by Ashley Artus), a clock named Ticker (played by Mike Hayley), and from the sixth series onwards, a butler named Branston (played by Brian Miller); they were frequently visited by a pirate named Captain Kevin (played by Roger Griffiths), and on three occasions by a mechanic named Megamax (played by Fidel Nanton), Glimmer's girlfriend Princess Penelope (who had come to visit Scrap when he was ill and ate all his chocolates) and a Russian ballet dancer named Nadia Nokoblokov (who had come to perform Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin's \"Minute Waltz\"). For the seventh series, they were also frequently visited by a detective named Shelley Holmes (played by Issy Van Randwyck) - however, this recurring sketch would only go on until the end of that series. Although this series was made after the corporate change in Winter 1997 (as evidenced by the then-new BBC logo at the end of each episode), it was not broadcast until 13 January 1998.\n\nThis series and the next one were originally aired on Tuesdays as part of the then-newly renamed \"Schools Programmes\" strand at 9:45am.\n\nIn this first new-style episode, Tim wakes up in the middle of the night, brushes his teeth and pours himself a bowl of corn flakes (but has to wait until the morning for the milk), Little Juan wakes up all the other villagers because he does not know that a fiesta is held in the evening (rather than the morning or the afternoon), the residents of the Dolls' House take turns in getting their meals ready and Bill takes a Polaroid of both himself and his new co-star Bernie (who came in covered in mud, so he has to give her a bath before taking another one), but Bill got himself covered in mud while trying to get her in the bath, so she takes another Polaroid of him to show him.\n\n\nTim sets off to referee a football match (but the forecast for that day is \"windy\", so he has to change into his best suit), Little Juan has football practice but cannot remember which day it is on, Bill decides to go on holiday to get away from the rain (but leaves Bernie behind with only seven cans of cat food, one for each day of the week, and a can opener) and Scrap and Glimmer get into an argument over a teddy bear so Captain Kevin has to sort it out; also, not only is the newspaper in this episode's \"Tim\" sketch dated from before the BBC's corporate change (10 April 1997), but it is factually incorrect, as it says that day was a Monday, when it was in fact a Thursday.\n\n\nTim tries to put on his new suit with a jacket, a pair of trousers, a hat, a pair of shoes, a pair of socks and a tie but keeps doing it in the wrong order, El Nombre helps Mama to make Delietta Smith (who is obviously a parody of Delia Smith)'s wonderful omelette with red and green peppers, Bill wakes Bernie up for dinnertime but forgets all about the food, and Scrap and Glimmer try to make a chocolate splodge cake for Annie; this is also the first episode to refer to the Dolls' House by name, despite being the third one in this series.\n\n\nTim grows two flowers and photographs them but cannot wait for the third, Pedro bets Juan he can find a spider who is faster than Tanto, Bernie wants to get an apple off a tree but cannot reach it (so Bill offers to fly up there, but when he learns he cannot, he challenges her to a tower-building contest) and Megamax is coming for tea at the Dolls' House so Annie, Scrap and Glimmer have to paint it, but the latter runs down, so when Megamax arrives, he deduces that he needs a new battery and gives him the \"Max Pack Turbo Booster\" to fix him.\n\n\nEl Nombre helps Little Juan to find out some things about the clock face for his homework, Scrap and Glimmer are bored so they decide to give Ticker's spring a big clean, and Bill trips over the sleeping Bernie and flies into his clock, causing all its numbers and both its hands to fall off; when he has put them all back on (with the help of Bernie), the clock's cuckoo calls at 3:00 and causes him to faint.\n\n\nLittle Juan and his friends prepare to go on a school outing to see Santo Flamingo United playing in the cup final at 3:00, Bernie takes a nap at 2:00 but Bill plays a prank on her by moving the clock an hour ahead and waking her up by replacing the cuckoo, and Scrap waits for the postwoman to deliver his new \"Scrap Jacket\" (which he had been going on about all night and keeping Glimmer from getting sleep).\n\n\nTim (saying his only line, \"Cook for half an hour\", in this episode) cooks a big pie he has bought, but gets bored while waiting so eats all his other groceries, Scrap is ill so Annie asks Glimmer to take his temperature every hour and give him his medicine every half-hour (but his girlfriend, Princess Penelope, comes to visit), Bernie is enjoying a \"cattuccino\" at the foot of a Big Ben-like clock tower until Bill bungee-jumps from its minute hand, steals it when he springs back up to its face, drinks it and returns the empty cup to her, and Pedro, Juanita, and Maria all agree to meet Juan for a game of football at 2:30 (but Juan wonders how he will know when it is 2:30).\n\n\nTim has hiccups and tries to get rid of them by drinking a glass of water then holding his breath for ten seconds (but gets interrupted by a crank phone call the first time, and a crank door-caller the second time), San Flamingo School is holding a three-legged race as a part of their sports day, Bill and Bernie prepare to launch each other into outer space using only a seesaw, and Nadia Nokoblokov comes to visit the Dolls' House because she needs someone to help her out with her new dance (Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin's \"Minute Waltz\").\n\n\nTim receives a mysterious three-layered parcel on his doorstep in the middle of the night (which turns out to be a birthday cake) along with a musical birthday card (which plays a high-speed version of \"Happy Birthday to You\" to him), while El Nombre helps Juan and Juanita to put the four seasons in the right order for their homework (but they still have to draw a picture for each one), Bernie puts a smile on the face of a snowman (that turns out to be Bill) in winter, then the snow melts and some blossom grows on a tree in spring, Bill waters some flowers to help them grow and Bernie mows the lawn in summer, the leaves blow off the tree in autumn and Bernie throws a snowball at Bill and skates on the ice in winter before putting another smile on the face of another snowman (which, again, is Bill); the residents of the Dolls' House also have to organise their clothes for each season (but Glimmer thinks they are throwing them away).\n\n\nIn his last appearance, Tim is woken up by a train, then eats a bowl of corn flakes, drinks a cup of coffee and builds a house of cards as three more trains pass (the last one causes him to knock it down), Ticker is broken because Annie, Scrap and Glimmer did not oil him when he asked so Captain Kevin gives him one of his spare ship's bells as a replacement, Bill and Bernie test each other's knowledge of time with their clock (and Bill gets two of them wrong), and Miss Constanza Bonanza, Pedro, Juanita and Mama all remind Juan that it is choir practice at 4:30, it is football practice at 5:00, to come to her house for tea at 5:30, and to return home at 6:00 respectively.\n\n\nThe four shapes seen at the end of this series' episodes had been redesigned from those of the three previous ones, and were differently coloured to their originals as well (the circle was now green, the triangle was now yellow and the square was now red, but the rectangle kept its old-style colour of blue); also, in 1999, this series was released on VHS as a \"Video Plus Pack\" by BBC Educational Publishing.\n\nThe sixth series (which is, again, aimed at five- to six-year-olds) comprised five episodes focusing on the numbers 11, 12, 15, 17 and 20, in order; they did not cover the numbers 13, 14, 16, 18 and 19 (except in their opening titles with images of thirteen blocks, fourteen pencils, sixteen leaves, eighteen buttons and nineteen crayons). Each episode would open with Bill and Bernie finding the position of the episode's number on their number line (which had been carried over from the \"revised\" version of the first series) - and in this series, Santo Flamingo gained an ice-cream seller named Señor Gelato, a carpenter named Señor Chipito (who had, once again, previously appeared in the second series as the owner of \"The Maggot and Cactus\" saloon) and a bandit named Don Fandango (who stole twenty gold coins from its newly built bank, which was managed by Señor Calculo, in the last episode). This series also saw former \"Blue Peter\" host Janet Ellis joining the \"El Nombre\" cast; although this series was made in Winter 1998, it was not broadcast until 12 January 1999.\n\nEleven soldiers (ten in two rows of five and the eleventh on the bottom) march around and ten of them make up the number eleven, Little Juan and his friends are preparing to go on a second school outing, this time to play a football match (but they only have ten football shirts, and El Nombre writes the episode's number in the desert sand), and Scrap receives a \"Soccerbox\" football game from his great-aunt Laura Litterbin (but it disappoints him as he does not like football, and one of the eleven white players goes missing).\n\n\nNow in song, a pair of green slugs eat a gardener's twelve plants (that are in three rows of four) and make the number twelve, Juan bets Juanita that he can do more skips than her (he also mistakenly pronounces her surname as \"Chiquita\" in this episode) and Pedro bets both of them he can do more than either of them (but when doing it, he counts as fast as he can), and Captain Kevin does not want Branston to mention the number twelve as it reminds him of the final voyage of the good ship \"Rusty Bucket\" (when its crew found twelve biscuits).\n\n\nFifteen cars (in three rows of five) go nowhere and nobody seems to care, Señor Gelato accidentally drives his ice-cream tricycle into a three-legged table that Mama had told Juan and Pedro to take in to Señor Chipito for repairing (and they have to get a replacement wheel with fifteen spokes, but Juan initially thinks that it has more as he cannot tell which one he had started counting from), and Scrap and Glimmer are playing marbles in the lounge of the Dolls' House (but Glimmer is losing, rather badly, and his ten red marbles go missing).\n\n\nSeventeen windows (sixteen of them in four rows of four and the seventeenth one on the door) open up on a flat to let in some air, Pedro accidentally kicks his ball into the path of Señor Gelato's ice-cream tricycle (which causes him to swerve and crash into Señor Manuel's cart, upsetting his display of seventeen tomatoes) while playing football with Juan, and all the residents of the Dolls' House prepare a surprise party for Captain Kevin but Scrap eats three lots of cake mix that is supposed to be enough for twenty cakes leaving seventeen.\n\n\nA spaceship beams up twenty stars (that are in four rows of five) then beams them down again in the constellation of the number twenty, Don Fandango steals twenty gold coins from the bank of Santo Flamingo (but Tanto bites a hole in his bag causing them all to fall out), and Nadia Nokoblokov pays another visit to the Dolls' House to perform another dance (\"The Dance of Twenty Turns\") in its conservatory; however, Ticker (whose role in the \"Dolls' House\" sketches had been lessened by this point) realises that if he stays in the bedroom, he does not have to watch, and Scrap eats a cake he had been told to put twenty candles on so Annie and Nadia punish him by putting him on the revolving podium that Nadia had brought with her for the dance and telling Glimmer to force him to do twenty \"fast\" turns on it. Clips from the first series (both incarnations) and the fourth series were also re-used in a musical sketch at the end of this episode.\n\nIn 2000, both this series and the following one were released on VHS as \"Video Plus Packs\" by BBC Educational Publishing; on 4 May 2012, this one was rereleased on DVD as a \"DVD Plus Pack\" by BBC Active, with an accompanying teachers' book. The pack also contained an audio CD, featuring songs from the series (and initially released as an audio cassette) - and this one is still in print.\n\nThe seventh series, which is once again aimed at five- to six-year-olds, comprised five episodes focusing on how to add and identify two-figure numbers up to 100; each episode would open with Bill and Bernie, whose number line had been replaced by a number square, and joined by a caterpillar named Limo (voiced by Peter Temple), who would crawl around the square to count out the numbers they required. In Santo Flamingo, Maria's sister Pepita Consuela Tequila Chiquita also started at San Flamingo School.\n\nThis series, which is the Dolls' House's last, was originally aired on Thursdays as part of the \"Schools Programmes\" strand at 10:50am.\n\nBernie stacks up twenty-nine plates (thrown to her by Bill), but does not know what comes after 29 so asks Limo to help; every time she stacks up ten more, she has to ask him again, but when she gets to 100, they fall over as a result of their weight. Scrap has also lost all except one of his fifty buttons so Shelley Holmes helps him to find them again, while Señor Gelato has only one cornet left so Juan volunteers to go down to Hurrell's store and get twenty-four more - but as he is about to set off, he is asked to get three extra ones.\n\n\nWhile dusting the number square, Bernie sneezes four of the numbers (18, 46, 69 and 83) out of it; after Limo has put them all back in, Bernie dusts Bill's beak, causing him to sneeze the entire number square over. Maria's sister Pepita also starts at San Flamingo School (which viewers see the inside of for the first time), while Glimmer cooks apple pie and custard (his Aunt Dimity's very own recipe) but Scrap has got the pages of his cookbook mixed up and Limo has to put four more numbers (24, 38, 77 and 96) back into the number square.\n\n\nBernie is tired so she decides to have forty winks, and Limo counts them by crawling along each row of the number square; Scrap is also tired of licking envelopes (containing invitations to Glimmer's birthday party), while Juan takes all the money that he has saved up in his donkey bank to Santo Flamingo Bank and Bill and Bernie ask Limo if he can find the numbers 30 and 90 and add on ten.\n\n\nBill makes twelve sandwiches and ten iced buns for a party (and Bernie makes ten more of both, but they both make ten rock cakes each), while Scrap and Glimmer are making party bags for a party of their own, Señora Fedora opens the 15th Annual Santo Flamingo Egg Festival and chooses Mama to make its giant omelette (for which she needs sixty-one eggs but only has twenty-one) and Bill and Bernie eat thirty of the \"goodies\" that they have made for their party, but Bill drops the ten remaining buns and Bernie slides on their remains into him causing him to drop ten of the sandwiches, and when they decide to have a dance he throws the ten of the remaining twelve into the air.\n\n\nBill has been shopping and bought twenty packs of five fish fingers (but forgot the chips, as Bernie finds out once she has put them all in the freezer), while Glimmer is painting a five-dot pattern, and San Flamingo School is holding a jumble sale; this was also the final episode to feature the Dolls' House (and although it credits Victoria Gay at the end of it, she did not appear as Annie in this series).\n\n\nThe eighth series, which is aimed at five- to seven-year-olds, comprised ten episodes focusing on coin recognition, money problems, coin equivalents and change (which the BBC had previously covered in the second series of their later primary maths show, \"Megamaths\"); each episode would open with eight \"money-spiders\" (one for each coin - 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 and £2) coming down into view from the top of a tree. In this series, the currency of pounds and pence was introduced to Santo Flamingo, which gained a railway station named El Loco and a pizza delivery boy named Leonardo de Sombrero - and the recurring song from the first series, \"Numbers All Around\", was also reworked (to focus on coins instead of numbers). This series also introduced the recurring sketch of Screensaver, which featured a screen named Screen (voiced by Sue Elliott-Nicholls), a variety of customers (who were all played by one-time \"Spitting Image\" impressionist Michael Fenton-Stevens), and a robot named T1L (pronounced \"Til\", and played by Paul Vates).\n\nThis series was originally aired on each day of the working week for a fortnight as part of the \"Schools Programmes\" strand at 11:05am.\n\nJuan, Mama and Pedro go to the fair (but do not know if they have the right money for the coconut shy, roundabout or candy floss), while Bill is running a cake stall but Bernie cannot decide whether she wants one or not so flips four coins (1p, 2p, 5p and 10p) into the air but they do not come down again, and a cricket player wants to buy some glue from Screensaver to stick his old broken bat back together.\n\n\nSan Flamingo School is holding another jumble sale (this time to raise money for the new school bell), while Bill is now running a drink stall (but after he sells his last drink to Bernie for 8p, he has to close it, and Bernie then disguises herself as a vending machine to trick Bill into giving her money back), and a policeman wants to buy a timepiece from Screensaver (who try to sell him Big Ben for 10p).\n\n\nLittle Juan and his friends are going to Santo Flamingo National Park to see the Giant Cactus, while Bill is now running an \"everything\" stall (but when Bernie manages to scrape 10p together from a 5p coin, two 2p coins and a 1p coin, she wheels it away after misconstruing the meaning of \"everything 10p\"), and a sailor wants to buy a cake for his mother from Screensaver (who try to sell him a wedding cake).\n\n\nLittle Juan and his friends have now arrived at Santo Flamingo National Park and seen the Giant Cactus, while Bill and Bernie are hungry so they buy a snack for 5p, a carton of juice for 2p and a bar of chocolate for 3p (from three talking vending machines), and an old man wants to buy a new wheel for his wheel-basket from Screensaver because the old one is broken (and they try to sell him a bicycle wheel).\n\n\nJuan and Juanita notice that Señor Manuel has put up a giant jellybean machine outside Hurrell's store, while Bernie plays \"Coin Sports\" and loses Bill's 1p, 2p, 5p and 10p coins after they have rolled into a river (making 18p altogether), and a Russian secret agent wishes to change his appearance at Screensaver (who sell him a Hawaiian shirt for 4p, a blond wig for 8p and a striped bow tie for another 8p).\n\n\nMama takes Juan back-to-school shopping at Hurrell's store (and has him try on a hat which is too big for him), while Bernie pays 20p to go on an elephant ride and gets 5p change (but she finds it slow, so pays another 20p to go on a rocket ride and gets another 5p change, then masquerades as a cat ride in order to trick Bill into giving her a third 5p, and after Bill does that and she gives him the ride of his life, he wants to do it again, but she is tired out so she does not), and a chef wants to buy some butter and eggs from Screensaver.\n\n\nSeñor Gelato promises Juan and Juanita an ice-cream if they go to the Santo Flamingo Bank and get him some coins in exchange for the 50p he gave them, while Bill and Bernie try to get out of a car park (but when Bill has scraped 50p together, the barrier catapults him into the air), and a businessman wishes to buy a pet from Screensaver (who try to sell him a \"Starpet\", from their own home planet, for 50p).\n\n\nMiss Bonanza is getting married (and Juan is responsible for the school's collection of 50p with which to buy her a present), while Bill pays 50p to have his photograph taken and gets 20p change (but it takes it before he can go inside the booth, so Bernie pays another 50p to have her photograph taken while Bill counts her change, but when she looks out of the booth to ask why it is taking so long, it takes a photograph of her tail, so they then combine their changes to have their photograph taken together), and a rock star wants to buy some new shoes from Screensaver because his old ones just \"aren't his scene\" (and they sell him a pair of blue suede platforms for 15p each).\n\n\nPedro, Juanita and Maria are sleeping over at Juan's house (and planning to watch a really scary film), while Bill and Bernie are doing their laundry (and have to pay 10p for washing powder in addition to £1 for the washing machine, but when Bernie inserts a £1 coin into the washing powder machine, she gets ten cups, and because she pours them all into the washing machine, it starts spewing foam all over the floor of the launderette) and a cowboy named Tom (nicknamed \"Big T\") wishes to buy a shirt with a big \"T\" on it from Screensaver.\n\n\nLittle Juan is to perform a concert to raise more money for the school bell (with Don Fandango masquerading as Mama and trying to steal all his earnings), while Bill and Bernie want to go on a boat trip for £2 (but although Bernie has a £2 coin, they both have to go back home so Bill can scrape it together in other coins, and when they get back to the boat, Bernie gets on it before it pulls out, but Bill is not so lucky because he had to carry all his coins back there in a giant sack), and a non-speaking clown tries to get Screen and T1L (in their last appearance) to guess that he wants to buy a top hat (for 50p) and a rabbit to pull out of it (for £1.50) at Screensaver.\n\n\nIn 2001, by which point VHS was becoming obsolete, this series was released on VHS as a \"Video Plus Pack\" by BBC Educational Publishing.\n\nThe ninth (and final) series, which is aimed at six- to seven-year-olds, comprised ten episodes focusing on the concepts of adding and subtracting similar to the fourth series (only without Lolita, live-action sketches based on nursery rhymes, or Test the Toad); in this series, Numbertime News, which had appeared in five episodes of the first series with Sammy Sport (played by Andy McEwan, who had played Matt Dillon in \"Death Without Dishonour\", the twenty-sixth episode of \"Taggart\"), along with one episode of the fourth series with Rebecca Testament (played by Issy Van Randwyck), became a recurring sketch, with anchorwoman Tara Boomdeay (played by Elisabeth Sladen, who had played Sarah-Jane on \"Doctor Who\", as well as several characters in fifteen episodes over the third and aforementioned fourth series) and roving reporter Brad Quiff (played by Ian Connaughton). This series also saw Michael Fenton-Stevens returning to join the \"El Nombre\" cast and introduced the character of Addem (voiced by Richard Pearce), a green snake who discovered the series' concept in the company of a yellow ant named Ann (voiced by Moir Leslie) and a whole civilisation of other multi-coloured ants (mostly voiced by both Brian Bowles and Richard Pearce, but the Queen Ant was again voiced by Moir Leslie).\n\nThis series was originally screened on Mondays as part of the \"Schools Programmes\" strand at 11:05am, but 1 October 2001 was the first day of that year's four-day Labour Party Conference, so its fourth episode was not shown until the following week.\n\nBrad Quiff investigates addition (with the \"High Peaks Climbing Team\"), Bernie challenges Bill by giving him some numbers for him to add onto and make twenty, Addem discovers a civilisation of ants (headed up by Ann), and Little Juan enters a competition on Radio Flamingo.\n\n\nJuan and Pedro go shopping when Señor Calculo throws a barbecue, Bernie plants some seeds in window boxes and Bill helps her to add them up, Brad Quiff investigates how many chocolate bars the Malarkey Gang have stolen and Ann has to get twenty-nine ants into three houses.\n\n\nAddem helps Ann sort out beds for the \"adolescants\", Little Juan faces off against Don Fandango in the final of the Santo Flamingo Darts Championships, Brad Quiff reports on the popularity of the \"Princess Patsy\" doll and Bill and Bernie wash their socks at the launderette of the eighth series.\n\n\nBrad Quiff visits a country fair to meet the makers of buns, El Nombre reads Little Juan a bedtime story (about Don Fandango robbing the Santo Flamingo Bank), Ann needs to prepare twenty-five meals for the \"Accounts Department\" and Bill and Bernie try to make carrot juice.\n\n\nAnn learns about adding acorns in hundreds, Brad Quiff reports on the opening of the brand-new \"Whizzo Lolly Factory\", Bill helps Bernie count her pennies as she is planning to \"shop 'till she drops\", and Juan and Pedro earn pocket money by picking lemons for Señor Manuel.\n\n\nBrad Quiff reports on an American football team passing the ball back down a numberline, Bernie challenges Bill again by giving him some more numbers (this time to subtract from them and leave ten), a pair of cowboy ants have to take twenty-seven aphids to the milking shed and Juan is going on vacation to Costa Fortuna with Mama, Pedro, Juanita and Maria after winning the competition from the first episode.\n\n\nThe Queen Ant decides to hold a regatta, Juan and his party get on the plane to Costa Fortuna, Bill washes some more of his socks at the launderette but Bernie tells him that he needs to separate the whites from the coloureds, and Brad Quiff reports on how crowds have been gathering for \"Punch and Judy\" performances all day; for this episode's adaptation of the story (which was also frequently adapted by camp entertainer Mr. Partridge on the BBC's own \"Hi-De-Hi\"), Mr. Punch steals Judy's marbles from her box while she is asleep.\n\n\nBrad Quiff reports on an annual tug-of-war contest between the Diddletown Dodgers and the Softville Saints, Ann needs eighty-two candles for the Queen Ant's birthday cake, Juan and his party arrive at the Sea View Hotel in Costa Fortuna (where they meet their guide, Pablo) and Bill and Bernie insert two 20p coins into two of the three talking vending machines of the eighth series, to buy a snack for 16p and a carton of juice for 14p (receiving 4p and 6p change); they then combine their changes to buy a bar of chocolate for 10p from the third talking vending machine. This is also one of only two episodes to have an \"El Nombre\" sketch that is not set in Santo Flamingo at all.\n\n\nJuan and Pedro go to the fair in Costa Fortuna (where their guide, Pablo, fronts a ring-toss game), Ann has to fill forty-five places in the \"Accountants\"' new building, Bill is running an apple stall (but when Bernie wants to buy three, he finds out he has not got any, so they both pick some off an apple tree) and Brad Quiff reports on \"Doreen's Sweet Shop\" getting robbed of a large pile of chocolate eggs.\n\n\nIn the show's last episode, a squad of 100 marching ants keeps breaking up and coming back together, Juan and his party are on the plane back to Santo Flamingo (and when they get back to its airport, they are told that they can only bring back a certain amount of things at customs), Brad Quiff reports on the \"Numbertime News Live Formation Climbing Team\" (who show the viewers a trick to remember their sums) and Bill and Bernie have a cup of tea (but Bill puts ten cubes of sugar in his, and when Bernie asks him what he is doing, she makes him forget how many he has put in there); even though this was the last episode, El Nombre got a second series of his spin-off show in 2003.\n\n\nIn 2002, by which time VHS was even more obsolete, this series was released on VHS as a \"Video Plus Pack\" by BBC Educational Publishing.\n\nThe first series was accompanied by a ten-part radio series on BBC School Radio entitled \"Radio Numbertime\", which again focused on the numbers 1-10, in order; it ran from 21 September to 30 November 1993. Another radio series, which was entitled simply \"Numbertime\" like the television series, was broadcast on BBC School Radio from 29 September 2000 to 26 March 2003 - and a third radio series, which was again entitled \"Numbertime\" like the defunct television series, was broadcast on BBC School Radio from 1 May to 26 June 2014.\n"}

{"id": "4134187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4134187", "title": "Paul Tannery", "text": "Paul Tannery\n\nPaul Tannery (20 December 1843 – 27 November 1904) was a French mathematician and historian of mathematics. He was the older brother of mathematician Jules Tannery, to whose \"Notions Mathématiques\" he contributed an historical chapter. Though Tannery's career was in the tobacco industry, he devoted his evenings and his life to the study of mathematicians and mathematical development.\n\nTannery was born in Mantes-la-Jolie on 20 December 1843, to a deeply Catholic family. He attended private school in Mantes, followed by the Lycées in Le Mans and Caen. He then entered the École Polytechnique, on whose entrance exam he excelled. His curriculum included mathematics, the sciences, and the classics, all of which would be represented in his future academic work. Tannery's life of public service began as he then entered the École d'Applications des Tabacs as an apprentice engineer.\n\nAs an assistant engineer, Tannery spent two years in the state tobacco factory at Lille. In 1867, he moved to Paris; three years later, he served as an artillery captain in the Franco-Prussian War. Biographies of Tannery describe him as an ardent patriot and claim that he never fully accepted the humiliating Treaty of Frankfurt.\n\nAfter his graduation from the École Polytechnique, Tannery had become interested in Auguste Comte and his positivist philosophy. After the war, his interest in mathematics continued, and Comte's ideas would influence his approach to the study of the history of science. Tannery moved several times with his career in the tobacco industry: to Périgord in 1872, to Bordeaux in 1874, to Le Havre in 1877, and to Paris in 1883. Bordeaux had something of an intellectual atmosphere, and though Tannery moved to Le Havre (near his parents, who lived at Caen) at his own request, he would also directly request the move to Paris, where his research and academic pursuits would be able to flourish.\n\nIt was in Paris that Tannery took on his first two major editorial works. In 1883, he began an edition of Diophantus's manuscripts, and in 1885, he and Charles Henry began an edition of one of Fermat's works. This work was made possible by access to the Bibliothèque Nationale, and so Tannery had to reduce his efforts in 1886 when he was transferred to Tonneins. Even without access to the Bibliothèque, Tannery remained hard at work, however, as he published two books composed of articles he had been writing for the \"Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger\" and for the \"Bulletin de sciences mathematiques\".\n\nIn 1888, Tannery moved back to Bordeaux, where he studied Greek astronomy and directed the tobacco factory. Two years later, he was back in Paris; he would remain near Paris until his death. Despite a heavy professional workload, he continued to be productive in his work in the history of science. His editions of Diophantus and Fermat were published, along with over 250 articles. From 1890 forward, Tannery's other major work focused on a new edition of Descartes's works and correspondence, on which he collaborated with Charles Adam, an historian of modern philosophy.\n\nScandal arose in 1903 when the Collège de France began a search for a new professor of the history of science. Tannery was considered something of a shoe-in; he even began writing his inaugural lecture. Instead, the position went to Grégoire Wyrouboff, who concentrated on modern mathematicians instead of Tannery's classical and seventeenth-century idols.

That is, a point is defined only by some properties, called axioms, that it must satisfy. In particular, the geometric points do not have any length, area, volume or any other dimensional attribute. A common interpretation is that the concept of a point is meant to capture the notion of a unique location in Euclidean space.\n\nPoints, considered within the framework of Euclidean geometry, are one of the most fundamental objects. Euclid originally defined the point as \"that which has no part\". In two-dimensional Euclidean space, a point is represented by an ordered pair (, ) of numbers, where the first number conventionally represents the horizontal and is often denoted by , and the second number conventionally represents the vertical and is often denoted by . This idea is easily generalized to three-dimensional Euclidean space, where a point is represented by an ordered triplet (, , ) with the additional third number representing depth and often denoted by . Further generalizations are represented by an ordered tuplet of terms, where is the dimension of the space in which the point is located.\n\nMany constructs within Euclidean geometry consist of an infinite collection of points that conform to certain axioms. This is usually represented by a set of points; As an example, a line is an infinite set of points of the form formula_1, where through and are constants and is the dimension of the space. Similar constructions exist that define the plane, line segment and other related concepts. A line segment consisting of only a single point is called a degenerate line segment.\n\nIn addition to defining points and constructs related to points, Euclid also postulated a key idea about points, that any two points can be connected by a straight line. This is easily confirmed under modern extensions of Euclidean geometry, and had lasting consequences at its introduction, allowing the construction of almost all the geometric concepts known at the time. However, Euclid's postulation of points was neither complete nor definitive, and he occasionally assumed facts about points that did not follow directly from his axioms, such as the ordering of points on the line or the existence of specific points. In spite of this, modern expansions of the system serve to remove these assumptions.\n\nThere are several inequivalent definitions of dimension in mathematics. In all of the common definitions, a point is 0-dimensional.\n\nThe dimension of a vector space is the maximum size of a linearly independent subset. In a vector space consisting of a single point (which must be the zero vector 0), there is no linearly independent subset. The zero vector is not itself linearly independent, because there is a non trivial linear combination making it zero: formula_2.\n\nThe topological dimension of a topological space \"X\" is defined to be the minimum value of \"n\", such that every finite open cover formula_3 of \"X\" admits a finite open cover formula_4 of \"X\" which refines formula_3 in which no point is included in more than \"n\"+1 elements. If no such minimal \"n\" exists, the space is said to be of infinite covering dimension.\n\nA point is zero-dimensional with respect to the covering dimension because every open cover of the space has a refinement consisting of a single open set.\n\nLet \"X\" be a metric space. If \"S\" ⊂ \"X\" and \"d\" ∈ [0, ∞), the \"d\"-dimensional Hausdorff content of \"S\" is the infimum of the set of numbers δ ≥ 0 such that there is some (indexed) collection of balls formula_6 covering \"S\" with \"r\" > 0 for each \"i\" ∈ \"I\" that satisfies formula_7.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of \"X\" is defined by\n\nA point has Hausdorff dimension 0 because it can be covered by a single ball of arbitrarily small radius.\n\nAlthough the notion of a point is generally considered fundamental in mainstream geometry and topology, there are some systems that forgo it, e.g. noncommutative geometry and pointless topology. A \"pointless\" or \"pointfree\" space is defined not as a set, but via some structure (algebraic or logical respectively) which looks like a well-known function space on the set: an algebra of continuous functions or an algebra of sets respectively. More precisely, such structures generalize well-known spaces of functions in a way that the operation \"take a value at this point\" may not be defined.\nA further tradition starts from some books of A. N. Whitehead in which the notion of region is assumed as a primitive together with the one of \"inclusion\" or \"connection\".\n\nOften in physics and mathematics, it is useful to think of a point as having non-zero mass or charge (this is especially common in classical electromagnetism, where electrons are idealized as points with non-zero charge). The Dirac delta function, or function, is (informally) a generalized function on the real number line that is zero everywhere except at zero, with an integral of one over the entire real line. The delta function is sometimes thought of as an infinitely high, infinitely thin spike at the origin, with total area one under the spike, and physically represents an idealized point mass or point charge. It was introduced by theoretical physicist Paul Dirac. In the context of signal processing it is often referred to as the unit impulse symbol (or function). Its discrete analog is the Kronecker delta function which is usually defined on a finite domain and takes values 0 and 1.\n\n\n\n"}

The points to be identified are specified by an equivalence relation. This is commonly done in order to construct new spaces from given ones. The quotient topology consists of all sets with an open preimage under the canonical projection map that maps each element to its equivalence class.\n\nLet be a topological space, and let be an equivalence relation on .

We say that \"g\" \"descends to the quotient\".\n\nThe continuous maps defined on \"X\"/~ are therefore precisely those maps which arise from continuous maps defined on \"X\" that respect the equivalence relation (in the sense that they send equivalent elements to the same image). This criterion is copiously used when studying quotient spaces.\n\nGiven a continuous surjection it is useful to have criteria by which one can determine if \"q\" is a quotient map. Two sufficient criteria are that \"q\" be open or closed. Note that these conditions are only sufficient, not necessary. It is easy to construct examples of quotient maps that are neither open nor closed. For topological groups, the quotient map is open.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Moreover, the equation allow us to calculate the natural frequency only if the eigenvector (as well as any other displacement vector) formula_12 is known. For academic interests, if the modal vectors are not known, we can repeat the foregoing process but with formula_13 and formula_14 taking the place of formula_15 and formula_12, respectively. By doing so we obtain the scalar formula_17, also known as Rayleigh's quotient:\n\nTherefore, the Rayleigh's quotient is a scalar whose value depends on the vector formula_14 and it can be calculated with good approximation for any arbitrary vector formula_14 as long as it lays reasonably far from the modal vectors formula_21, \"i\" = 1,2,3...,\"n\".\n\nSince, is it possible to state that the vector formula_14 differs from the modal vector formula_7 by a small quantity of first order, the correct result of the Rayleigh's quotient will differ not sensitively from the estimated one and that's what makes this method very useful. A good way to estimate the lowest modal vector formula_24, that generally works well for most structures (even though is not guaranteed), is to assume formula_24 equal to the static displacement from an applied force that has the same relative distribution of the diagonal mass matrix terms. The latter can be elucidated by the following 3-DOF example.\n\nAs an example, we can consider a 3-degree-of-freedom system in which the mass and the stiffness matrices of them are known as follows:\n\nTo get an estimation of the lowest natural frequency we choose a trial vector of static displacement obtained by loading the system with a force proportional to the masses:\n\nThus, the trial vector will become\n\nthat allow us to calculate the Rayleigh's quotient:\n\nformula_29\n\nThus, the lowest natural frequency, calculated by means of Rayleigh's quotient is:\n\nUsing a calculation tool is pretty fast to verify how much it differs from the \"real\" one. In this case, using MATLAB, it has been calculated that the lowest natural frequency is: formula_31 that has led to an error of formula_32 using the Rayleigh's approximation, that is a remarkable result.\n\nThe example shows how the Rayleigh's quotient is capable of getting an accurate estimation of the lowest natural frequency. The practice of using the static displacement vector as a trial vector is valid as the static displacement vector tends to resemble the lowest vibration mode.\n"}
{"id": "535836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=535836", "title": "Saturated model", "text": "Saturated model\n\nIn mathematical logic, and particularly in its subfield model theory, a saturated model \"M\" is one which realizes as many complete types as may be \"reasonably expected\" given its size. For example, an ultrapower model of the hyperreals is formula_1-saturated, meaning that every descending nested sequence of internal sets has a nonempty intersection, see Goldblatt (1998).\n\nLet κ be a finite or infinite cardinal number and \"M\" a model in some first-order language. Then \"M\" is called κ-saturated if for all subsets \"A\" ⊆ \"M\" of cardinality less than κ, \"M\" realizes all complete types over \"A\". The model \"M\" is called saturated if it is |\"M\"|-saturated where |\"M\"| denotes the cardinality of \"M\". That is, it realizes all complete types over sets of parameters of size less than |\"M\"|. According to some authors, a model \"M\" is called countably saturated if it is formula_1-saturated; that is, it realizes all complete types over countable sets of parameters. According to others, it is countably saturated if it is formula_3-saturated; i.e. realizes all complete types over finite parameter sets.\n\nThe seemingly more intuitive notion – that all complete types of the language are realized – turns out to be too weak (and is, appropriately, named weak saturation, which is the same as 1-saturation). The difference lies in the fact that many structures contain elements which are not definable (for example, any transcendental element of R is, by definition of the word, not definable in the field language). However, they still form a part of the structure, so we need types to describe relationships with them. Thus we allow sets of parameters from the structure in our definition of types. This argument allows us to discuss specific features of the model which we may otherwise miss – for example, a \"specific\" increasing sequence \"c\" having a bound can be expressed as realizing the type which uses countably many parameters. If the sequence is not definable, this fact about the structure cannot be described using the base language, so a weakly saturated structure may not bound the sequence, while an ω-saturated structure will.\n\nThe reason we only require parameter sets which are strictly smaller than the model is trivial: without this restriction, no infinite model is saturated. Consider a model \"M\", and the type Each finite subset of this type is realized in the (infinite) model \"M\", so by compactness it is consistent with \"M\", but is trivially not realized. Any definition which is universally unsatisfied is useless; hence the restriction.\n\nSaturated models exist for certain theories and cardinalities:\n\n\nBoth of these theories can be shown to be ω-categorical through the back-and-forth method. This can be generalized as follows: the unique model of cardinality κ of a countable κ-categorical theory is saturated.\n\nHowever, the statement that every model has a saturated elementary extension is not provable in ZFC. In fact, this statement is equivalent to the existence of a proper class of cardinals κ such that κ = κ. The latter identity implies that either for some λ, or κ is weakly inaccessible.\n\nThe notion of saturated model is dual to the notion of prime model in the following way: let \"T\" be a countable theory in a first-order language (that is, a set of mutually consistent sentences in that language) and let \"P\" be a prime model of \"T\". Then \"P\" admits an elementary embedding into any other model of \"T\". The equivalent notion for saturated models is that any \"reasonably small\" model of \"T\" is elementarily embedded in a saturated model, where \"reasonably small\" means cardinality no larger than that of the model in which it is to be embedded. Any saturated model is also homogeneous. However, while for countable theories there is a unique prime model, saturated models are necessarily specific to a particular cardinality. Given certain set-theoretic assumptions, saturated models (albeit of very large cardinality) exist for arbitrary theories. For λ-stable theories, saturated models of cardinality λ exist.\n\n"}

These bounds have since been improved by others: there is a crossing near formula_3. It is not known whether it is the smallest.\n\nJohn Edensor Littlewood, who was Skewes's research supervisor, had proved in that there is such a number (and so, a first such number); and indeed found that the sign of the difference formula_4 changes infinitely often. All numerical evidence then available seemed to suggest that formula_5 was always less than formula_6. Littlewood's proof did not, however, exhibit a concrete such number formula_1.\n\nIn , without assuming the Riemann hypothesis, Skewes proved that there must exist a value of formula_1 below\n\nSkewes's task was to make Littlewood's existence proof effective: exhibiting some concrete upper bound for the first sign change. According to Georg Kreisel, this was at the time not considered obvious even in principle.\n\nThese upper bounds have since been reduced considerably by using large scale computer calculations of zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The first estimate for the actual value of a crossover point was given by , who showed that somewhere between formula_13 and formula_14 there are more than formula_15 consecutive integers formula_1 with formula_2.\nWithout assuming the Riemann hypothesis, proved an upper bound of formula_18. A better estimate was formula_19 discovered by , who showed there are at least formula_20 consecutive integers somewhere near this value where formula_2 and suggested that there are probably at least formula_22. Bays and Hudson found a few much smaller values of formula_1 where formula_5 gets close to formula_6; the possibility that there are crossover points near these values does not seem to have been definitely ruled out yet, though computer calculations suggest they are unlikely to exist. gave a small improvement and correction to the result of Bays and Hudson. found a smaller interval for a crossing, which was slightly improved by . The same source shows that there exists a number formula_1 violating formula_9 below formula_28. This can be reduced to formula_29, assuming the Riemann hypothesis. gave formula_30.\n\nRigorously, proved that there are no crossover points below formula_31, improved by to formula_32, by to formula_33, by to formula_34, and by to formula_35.\n\nThere is no explicit value formula_1 known for certain to have the property formula_2 though computer calculations suggest some explicit numbers that are quite likely to satisfy this.\n\nEven though the natural density of the positive integers for which formula_38 does not exist, showed that the logarithmic density of these positive integers does exist and is positive. showed that this proportion is about 0.00000026, which is surprisingly large given how far one has to go to find the first example.\n\nRiemann gave an explicit formula for π(x), whose leading terms are (ignoring some subtle convergence questions)\n\nwhere the sum is over zeros ρ of the Riemann zeta function. The largest error term in the approximation formula_40 (if the Riemann hypothesis is true) is formula_41, showing that formula_6 is usually larger than formula_5. The other terms above are somewhat smaller, and moreover tend to have different complex arguments so mostly cancel out. Occasionally however, many of the larger ones might happen to have roughly the same complex argument, in which case they will reinforce each other instead of cancelling and will overwhelm the term formula_41. \n\nThe reason why the Skewes number is so large is that these smaller terms are quite a lot smaller than the leading error term, mainly because the first complex zero of the zeta function has quite a large imaginary part, so a large number (several hundred) of them need to have roughly the same argument in order to overwhelm the dominant term. The chance of formula_45 random complex numbers having roughly the same argument is about 1 in formula_46. This explains why formula_5 is sometimes larger than formula_48 and also why it is rare for this to happen. It also shows why finding places where this happens depends on large scale calculations of millions of high precision zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The argument above is not a proof, as it assumes the zeros of the Riemann zeta function are random which is not true. Roughly speaking, Littlewood's proof consists of Dirichlet's approximation theorem to show that sometimes many terms have about the same argument.\n\nIn the event that the Riemann hypothesis is false, the argument is much simpler, essentially because the terms formula_49 for zeros violating the Riemann hypothesis (with real part greater than 1/2) are eventually larger than formula_50.\n\nThe reason for the term formula_51 is that, roughly speaking, formula_52 counts not primes, but powers of primes formula_53 weighted by formula_54, and formula_51 is a sort of correction term coming from squares of primes.\n\nFor Roger Plymen's lecture notes on the Skewes Number, please go to www.ams.org/open-math-notes.

{"id": "1148456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1148456", "title": "Symmetry in biology", "text": "Symmetry in biology\n\nSymmetry in biology is the balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. In nature and biology, symmetry is always approximate. For example, plant leaves – while considered symmetrical – rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry creates a class of patterns in nature, where the near-repetition of the pattern element is by reflection or rotation.\n\nThe body plans of most multicellular organisms exhibit some form of symmetry, whether radial, bilateral, or spherical. A small minority, notably among the sponges, exhibit no symmetry (i.e., are asymmetric). Symmetry was once important in animal taxonomy; the Radiata, animals with radial symmetry, formed one of the four branches of Georges Cuvier's classification of the animal kingdom.\n\nRadially symmetric organisms resemble a pie where several cutting planes produce roughly identical pieces. Such an organism exhibits no left or right sides. They have a top and a bottom surface, or a front and a back.\n\nSymmetry has been important historically in the taxonomy of animals; Georges Cuvier classified animals with radial symmetry in the taxon Radiata (\"Zoophytes\"), which is now generally accepted to be a polyphyletic assemblage of different phyla of the Animal kingdom. Most radially symmetric animals are symmetrical about an axis extending from the center of the oral surface, which contains the mouth to the center of the opposite, , end. Radial symmetry is especially suitable for sessile animals such as the sea anemone, floating animals such as jellyfish, and slow moving organisms such as starfish. Animals in the phyla Cnidaria and Echinodermata are radially symmetric, although many sea anemones and some corals have bilateral symmetry defined by a single structure, the siphonoglyph.\n\nMany flowers are radially symmetric or actinomorphic. Roughly identical flower parts – petals, sepals, and stamens – occur at regular intervals around the axis of the flower, which is often the female part, with the carpel, style and stigma.\n\nMany viruses have radial symmetries, their coats being composed of a relatively small number of protein molecules arranged in a regular pattern to form polyhedrons, spheres, or ovoids. Most are icosahedrons.\n\n is a variant of radial symmetry found in jellyfish, which have four canals in an otherwise radial body plan.\n\nFlowering plants show fivefold symmetry in many flowers and in various fruits. This is well seen in the arrangement of the five carpels (the botanical fruits containing the seeds) in an apple cut transversely.\n\nSpherical symmetry occurs in an organism if it is able to be cut into two identical halves through any cut that runs through the organism's center. Organisms which show approximate spherical symmetry include the freshwater green alga \"Volvox\".\n\nIn bilateral symmetry (also called \"plane symmetry\"), only one plane, called the sagittal plane, divides an organism into roughly mirror image halves. Thus there is approximate reflection symmetry. Internal organs are however not necessarily symmetric.\n\nAnimals that are bilaterally symmetric have mirror symmetry in the sagittal plane, which divides the body vertically into left and right halves, with one of each sense organ and limb group on either side. At least 99% of animals are bilaterally symmetric, including humans, where facial symmetry influences people's judgements of attractiveness.\n\nWhen an organism normally moves in one direction, it inevitably has a front or head end. This end encounters the environment before the rest of the body as the organism moves along, so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there, and similarly it is the likely site for a mouth as food is encountered. A distinct head, with sense organs connected to a central nervous system, therefore (on this view) tends to develop (cephalization). Given a direction of travel which creates a front/back difference, and gravity which creates a dorsal/ventral difference, left and right are unavoidably distinguished, so a bilaterally symmetric body plan is widespread and found in most animal phyla. Bilateral symmetry also permits streamlining to reduce drag, and on a traditional view in zoology facilitates locomotion. However, in the Cnidaria, different symmetries exist, and bilateral symmetry is not necessarily aligned with the direction of locomotion, so another mechanism such as internal transport may be needed to explain the origin of bilateral symmetry in animals.\nThe phylum Echinodermata, which includes starfish, sea urchins and sand dollars, is unique among animals in having bilateral symmetry at the larval stage, but pentamerism (fivefold symmetry) as adults.\n\nBilateral symmetry is not easily broken. In experiments using the fruit fly, \"Drosophila\", in contrast to other traits (where laboratory selection experiments always yield a change), right- or left-sidedness in eye size, or eye facet number, wing-folding behavior (left over right) show a lack of response.\n\nFemales of some species select for symmetry, presumed by biologists to be a mark (technically a \"cue\") of fitness. Female barn swallows, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.\n\nFlowers in some families of flowering plants, such as the orchid and pea families, and also most of the figwort family, are bilaterally symmetric (zygomorphic).\n\nBiradial symmetry is a combination of radial and bilateral symmetry, as in the ctenophores. Here, the body components are arranged with similar parts on either side of a central axis, and each of the four sides of the body is identical to the opposite side but different from the adjacent side. This may represent a stage in the evolution of bilateral symmetry \"from a presumably radially symmetrical ancestor.\"\n\nNot all animals are symmetric. Many members of the phylum Porifera (sponges) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.\n\nIt is normal for essentially symmetric animals to show some measure of asymmetry. Usually in humans the left brain is structured differently to the right; the heart is positioned towards the left; and the right hand functions better than the left hand. The scale-eating cichlid \"Perissodus microlepis\" develops left or right asymmetries in their mouths and jaws that allow them to be more effective when removing scales from the left or right flank of their prey.\n\nThe approximately 400 species of flatfish also lack symmetry as adults, though the larvae are bilaterally symmetrical. Adult flatfish rest on one side, and the eye that was on that side has migrated round to the other (top) side of the body.\n\n\n\n"}

Conventionally, these price changes will be daily log returns, based upon the most commonly used closing price. The other leg of the swap will pay a fixed amount, which is the strike, quoted at the deal's inception. Thus the net payoff to the counterparties will be the difference between these two and will be settled in cash at the expiration of the deal, though some cash payments will likely be made along the way by one or the other counterparty to maintain agreed upon margin.\n\nThe features of a variance swap include:\n\nThe payoff of a variance swap is given as follows:\n\nwhere:\n\nThe annualised realised variance is calculated based on a prespecified set of sampling points over the period. It does not always coincide with the classic statistical definition of variance as the contract terms may not subtract the mean. For example, suppose that there are n+1 sample points \nformula_5\nDefine, for i=1 to n, formula_6 the natural log returns.\nThen \n\nwhere formula_8 is an annualisation factor normally chosen to be approximately the number of sampling points in a year (commonly 252). It can be seen that subtracting the mean return will decrease the realised variance. If this is done, it is common to use formula_9 as the divisor rather than formula_10, corresponding to an unbiased estimate of the sample variance.\n\nIt is market practice to determine the number of contract units as follows:\n\nwhere formula_12 is the corresponding vega notional for a volatility swap. This makes the payoff of a variance swap comparable to that of a volatility swap, another less popular instrument used to trade volatility.\n\nThe variance swap may be hedged and hence priced using a portfolio of European call and put options with weights inversely proportional to the square of strike.\n\nAny volatility smile model which prices vanilla options can therefore be used to price the variance swap. For example, using the Heston model, a closed-form solution can be derived for the fair variance swap rate. Care must be taken with the behaviour of the smile model in the wings as this can have a disproportionate effect on the price.\n\nWe can derive the payoff of a variance swap using Ito's Lemma. We first assume that the underlying stock is described as follows:\n\nformula_13\n\nApplying Ito's formula, we get:\n\nformula_14\n\nformula_15\n\nTaking integrals, the total variance is:\n\nformula_16\n\nWe can see that the total variance consists of a rebalanced hedge of formula_17 and short a log contract. <br>Using a static replication argument\n\n, i.e., any twice continuously differentiable contract can be replicated using a bond, a future and infinitely many puts and calls, we can show that a short log contract position is equal to being short a futures contract and a collection of puts and calls:\n\nformula_18\n\nTaking expectations and setting the value of the variance swap equal to zero, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the fair variance swap strike:\n\nformula_19\n\nWhere: <br>\nformula_20 is the initial price of the underlying security,<br>\nformula_21 is an arbitrary cutoff,<br>\nformula_22 is the strike of the each option in the collection of options used.\n\nOften the cutoff formula_23is chosen to be the current forward price formula_24, in which case the fair variance swap strike can be written in the simpler form:\n\nformula_25\n\nMany traders find variance swaps interesting or useful for their purity. An alternative way of speculating on volatility is with an option, but if one only has interest in volatility risk, this strategy will require constant delta hedging, so that direction risk of the underlying security is approximately removed. What is more, a replicating portfolio of a variance swap would require an entire strip of options, which would be very costly to execute. Finally, one might often find the need to be regularly rolling this entire strip of options so that it remains centered on the current price of the underlying \nsecurity.\n\nThe advantage of variance swaps is that they provide pure exposure to the volatility of the underlying price, as opposed to call and put options which may carry directional risk (delta). The profit and loss from a variance swap depends directly on the difference between realized and implied volatility.\n\nAnother aspect that some speculators may find interesting is that the quoted strike is determined by the implied volatility smile in the options market, whereas the ultimate payout will be based upon actual realized variance. Historically, implied variance has been above realized variance, a phenomenon known as the Variance risk premium, creating an opportunity for volatility arbitrage, in this case known as the rolling short variance trade. For the same reason, these swaps can be used to hedge Options on Realized Variance.\n\nClosely related strategies include straddle, volatility swap, correlation swap, gamma swap, conditional variance swap, corridor variance swap, forward-start variance swap, option on realized variance and correlation trading.\n"}

It has applications including as compact antennas, particularly in cellular phones.\n\nThe basic square is decomposed into nine smaller squares in the 3-by-3 grid. The four squares at the corners and the middle square are left, the other squares being removed. The process is repeated recursively for each of the five remaining subsquares. The Vicsek fractal is the set obtained at the limit of this procedure. The Hausdorff dimension of this fractal is formula_1 ≈ 1.46497.\n\nAn alternative construction (shown below in the left image) is to remove the four corner squares and leave the middle square and the squares above, below, left and right of it. The two constructions produce identical limiting curves, but one is rotated by 45 degrees with respect to the other.\n\nThe Vicsek fractal has the surprising property that it has zero area yet an infinite perimeter, due to its non-integer dimension. At each iteration, four squares are removed for every five retained, meaning that at iteration \"n\" the area is formula_2 (assuming an initial square of side length 1). When \"n\" approached infinity, the area approaches zero. The perimeter however is formula_3, because each side is divided into three parts and the center one is replaced with three sides, yielding an increase of three to five. The perimeter approaches infinity as \"n\" increases.\n\nThe boundary of the Vicsek fractal is the Type 1 quadratic Koch curve.\n\nThere is a three-dimensional analogue of the Vicsek fractal. It is constructed by subdividing each cube into 27 smaller ones, and removing all but the \"center cross\", the central cube and the six cubes touching the center of each face. Its Hausdorff dimension is formula_4 ≈ 1.7712.\n\nSimilarly to the two-dimensional Vicsek fractal, this figure has zero volume. Each iteration removes retains 7 cubes for every 27, meaning a volume of formula_5 at iteration \"n\", which approaches zero as \"n\" approaches infinity.\n\nThere exist an infinite number of cross sections which yield the two-dimensional Vicsek fractal.\n\n"}
