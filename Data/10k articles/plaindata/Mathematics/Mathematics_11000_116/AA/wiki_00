Its planar embedding has three hexagonal faces (including the one shown as the external face of the illustration) and twelve pentagonal faces. As a planar graph with only pentagonal and hexagonal faces, meeting in three faces per vertex, this graph is a fullerene. The existence of this fullerene has been known since at least 1968.\n\nThe 26-fullerene graph has formula_1 prismatic symmetry, the same group of symmetries as the triangular prism. This symmetry group has 12 elements; it has six symmetries that arbitrarily permute the three hexagonal faces of the graph and preserve the orientation of its planar embedding, and another six orientation-reversing symmetries.\n\nThe number of fullerenes with a given even number of vertices grows quickly in the number of vertices; 26 is the largest number of vertices for which the fullerene structure is unique. The only two smaller fullerenes are the graph of the regular dodecahedron (a fullerene with 20 vertices) and the graph of the truncated hexagonal trapezohedron (a 24-vertex fullerene), which are the two types of cells in the Weaire–Phelan structure.\n\nThe 26-fullerene graph has many perfect matchings. One must remove at least five edges from the graph in order to obtain a subgraph that has exactly one perfect matching. This is a unique property of this graph among fullerenes in the sense that, for every other number of vertices of a fullerene, there exists at least one fullerene from which one can remove four edges to obtain a subgraph with a unique perfect matching.\n\nThe vertices of the 26-fullerene graph can be labeled with sequences of 12 bits, in such a way that distance in the graph equals half of the Hamming distance between these bitvectors.\nThis can also be interpreted as an isometric embedding from the graph into a 12-dimensional taxicab geometry. The 26-fullerene graph is one of only five fullerenes with such an embedding.\n\nIn 2009, \"The New York Times\" published a puzzle involving Hamiltonian paths in this graph, taking advantage of the correspondence between its 26 vertices and the 26 letters of the English alphabet.\n"}

This historical luggage was foundational for his life and work in the communist Poland, assured him the system safety against tough repressions by the state authorities, which affected many Polish intellectuals and academicians.\n\nHe was the only child to the Galician family of well-educated and wealthy parents, his father Piotr Jan Grzegorczyk (1894–1968) was a polonist and historian of Polish literature involved into literary criticism, bibliographic studies, and chronicles of the Polish cultural life. Among many works, in 1967 Piotr authored \"Index Lexicorum Poloniae\" which listed almost without selection all Polish both dictionaries and encyclopedias except biographical ones published prior to 1964, in 1964 he published a bibliographic-literary monograph \"Lew Tołstoj w Polsce\" (Lev Tolstoy in Poland) which discussed reception of the works by a Russian writer Lev Tolstoy in the Polish literature, and full bibliographic record of the Polish literature for 1925–1931. In 1914, he matriculated at a gymnasium in Lwów, while in the years of the World War I he provided military service at first the Polish Legions (1914–1918) since 1915 and then since 1918 of the of the then newly created Second Polish Republic, which he finished in the rank of Captain. In 1921–1925, he studied Polonistics at the University of Warsaw, where he developed in linguistics and literature supervised by a historian of Polish literature , a corresponding member of the then top academy of sciences Polish Academy of Learning (PAU) in Kraków since 1928 and a member of the nationalist-conservative political party National Democracy (\"Endecja\") who in 1909 co-edited the first critical edition of a Polish Romantic poet Juliusz Słowacki's works and since 1920 was both an active member of the Lwów Scientific Society and the head of the Department of Polish Literature of the University of Warsaw with the position of a full professor, the editor-in-chief of a scientific quarterly \"\" (Literary Diary) for 1925–1932, and since 1926 the founding editor-in-chief of a scientific-literary monthly \"\" (Literary Movement) to which he made Piotr the secretary of editorial board until his death in 1933 when Piotr became the next editor-in-chief until 1937 and prepared full bibliography of this journal for 1926–1936. Since 1932 he managed the sections on translations of Polish literature and literary life in Poland, and published articles on the pages, of the \"Rocznik Literacki\" (Literary Annual). He was a polyglot with a great passion to the Italian literature, in particular in 1924 he authored a Polish-language popular handbook in the Yiddish language \"Język Żydowski (Żargon): Samouczek dla Polaków\" (Jewish Language (Jargon): A Tutorial for Poles) published in Lwów and Warsaw by Książnica Polska (Polish Library) of the Polish Society of University Teachers\".\" During the 1939–1945 Nazi-Soviet occupation of Poland, he stayed in Warsaw where he collaborated with the Polish both underground press and secret publishing houses, prepared the work \"Polska\" w \"poezji angielskiej\" (Poland in English Poetry) in 1944, while in 1945 he relocated to Kraków where he dedicated to an amateur bibliographic work. In 1960 he restarted publishing with the \"\", which after the 20-year absence was restored as a cultural-literary bimonthly, and was appointed an editorial board member therein, while in 1955 he restarted publishing with the \"Rocznik Literacki\" for which he was writing an article when he suddenly died in 1968. Piotr had never been and wanted to be a professor, the Polish both interwar and post-war state authorities had never awarded him by either order or medal, but, as the recognition of his many-year dedicated work to the Polish academia, in 1945 he was elected a member of the Historico-Literary Commission of the PAU in Kraków which along with the Jagiellonian University in Kraków restored the interwar Poland's academic press, and, after in 1951 the communist authorities strongly restricted activities of the PAU by purely political reasons due to its members' intellectual and political independence to create manifestly subordinated academy of sciences named the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAS), he became a member of the Kraków Division of the PAS created in 1957 to replace the PAU's disloyal structures. Among his multiple bibliographies he prepared detailed records, in 1957 of written works by an artist and writer Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (Witkacy) who was fascinated in the Jewish culture, in 1959 of works by an artist and art historian Stanisław Noakowski who in 1923 got the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, in 1960 of writings by a famous Polish-Jewish philosopher Władysław Tatarkiewicz who was a full member of the PAU and the PAS since 1930 and 1956 respectively and in 1938 got both the Knight's Cross of the National Order of the Legion of Honour as well as the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta to be awarded by the communist Poland's highest state academic prize '' in 1966, and, moreover, yet in 1949 of books by a Polish modernist poet of Czech-German descent Leopold Henryk Staff, a leader of the Young Poland poetry in 1900–1918 and the spiritual leader of the experimental poetry group Skamander in 1918–1939, who was primarily influenced by the philosophy of a German idealist and existentialist Friedrich Nietzsche and who got the Officer's Cross and the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta in 1923 and 1933 respectively, Doctor Honoris Causa degree of the University of Warsaw in 1939 and the Jagiellonian University in Kraków in 1949, the Gold Cross of Merit in 1946, nomination to the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950 by the President of the Polish PEN Club Jan Parandowski, the '' in 1951 and 1955, and the 1st class Order of the Banner of Work in 1953.\n\nAndrzej's mother Zofia Jadwiga née Zdziarska was a Medical Doctor from a purely Polish landed gentry family of the Gozdawa coat of arms originated in a landed estate Zdziar Wielki in the Płock Governorate, the Congress Kingdom of Poland created in the personal union with the Russian Empire under the Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias Alexander I by the 1815 Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland which was never fully respected by the Tsarist autocracy and under the Viceroy of the Congress Poland former General of the Napoleonic army Józef Zajączek gave the autonomy in an independent and sovereign judiciary and separated state-administrative organs such like both Parliament and Army with the national monetary and measure system, as a result of the 1815 Congress of Vienna due to the fall of the First French Empire under the Emperor of the French Napoleon Bonaparte who by the 1807 Treaties of Tilsit and the Constitution of the Duchy of Warsaw of 22 July 1807 formed the French client state Duchy of Warsaw as the first Polish statehood on the map of Europe since the three-part 1772–1795 Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth under the both King of Saxony and Duke of Warsaw Frederick Augustus I of the House of Wettin and since October 1807 the Prime Minister Stanisław Małachowski of the Nałęcz coat-of-arms, who already in December 1807 became the president of the Senate in the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw until 1809 and in 1788–1792 was the of the Great Sejm famous for adoption of the Constitution of 3 May 1791 blocked by the Russian Empire under the Empress and Autocrat of All the Russias Catherine II the Great at the invitation of the 1792 Targowica Confederation established by the Polish-Lithuanian magnates in Saint Petersburg to form the 1792 Second Partition as a result of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth army's defeat in the 1972 Polish–Russian War which forced the last King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania Stanisław August Poniatowski to join the confederation and abdicate in November 1795 in the aftermath of the 1974 Kościuszko Uprising suppressed by the forces of Empress Catherine II and the King of Prussia Frederick William II to form the base for the 1795 Third Partition along with the last Holy Roman Emperor and the first Emperor of Austria Francis II and I. Zofia's family members belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, although presented generally strongly left-wing political orientation, in particular her paternal grandfather Paweł Zdziarski made military service to the 1863–1864 January Uprising against occupation of the Russian Empire in the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, was multiple times repressed by the Tsarist authorities of the Congress Poland, and was liked and respected by the local Polish society. Her mother Zofia Ludwika née Sąchocka of the Zagłoba coat of arms was a school teacher in Płock, her father Bolesław Julian Zdziarski (1863–1931) was born during the January uprising and in 1884 matriculated at the present-day Marshal Stanisław Małachowski High School in Płock, then named the Governorate Gymnasium in Płock, in the period of enhanced Russification of the Polish schools in the aftermath of the fall of the January Uprising. Already in the school years, Bolesław became well known for an active participation in the anti-Russian conspirations among students, after completion of secondary education he joined the in Puławy to be expelled with a wolf ticket in May 1887 for participation in the student riots, and was able to complete the final examinations and graduate only in 1889 when his article on too small salaries for Płock Governorate's farmworkers appeared in print and was awarded by a student prize. Under the pseudonym \"Gozdawa,\" on the pages of a Polish-language newspapers \"\" (Truth: political, social, and literary weekly) and the \"Dziennik Płocki\" (Płock Daily), he published Polish-language articles dedicated to socio-political problems of Polish villages in the Russian Empire, developed a broad social activity in Mazovia known as a person dedicated to his family and the manager of a small landed estate and household in a village Cieśle near Bodzanów given him by his father. Thanks to Bolesław's efforts, there was created the Society of Mutual Credit which was the first ever such organization in the Congress Poland, he created multiple cooperative dairies, secret Polish schools, volunteer fire departments, and provincial farm exhibitions, and, although in the Saint Petersburg's Tsarist offices he won four conflicts against a Płock Governor who opposed creation of the Polish institutions, he was frequently accused of anti-Tsarist activities and imprisoned, for example in the Alexander Citadel of Warsaw which was built by the order of the Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias Nicholas I implemented by the Prince of Warsaw and Viceroy of the Congress Poland for 1832–1856 Field Marshal Ivan Paskevich to strengthen the repressive control after successful suppression of the 1830–1831 November Uprising also known as the Cadet Revolution, which in to openly declare the 1831 Polish-Russian War whose downfall caused the '\"eternal incorporation\"' by intensive Russification and economic-political Russian repressions such like abolishment of the Sejm of Congress Poland in favour of the Second Council of State and marriage of the Army of Congress Poland with the Imperial Russian Army under the 1832 Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland followed by the 1831–1870 Great Emigration of the political and social exiles, and which was the place of imprisonment and execution of the 1863–1864 January Uprising's leading figures including its dictator General Romuald Traugutt who left the Imperial Russian Army in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel for his military merits in the successful Austrian-Russian suppression of the 1848–1849 Hungarian Revolution and the Russian defeat in the 1853–1856 Crimean War against the Ottoman Empire and its British-French-Sardinian alliance. By the long lasting imprisonment, in 1902 Bolesław was forced to sell the landed estate in Cieśle and to stop construction of a small fertilizers factory, he bought the landed estate in a village Zdziar Wielki near Płock, and, after the Second Polish Republic along with Finland and the Baltic states declared independence from the Soviet Russia in 1917–1918 in the aftermath of the Russian Empire's collapse by abdication of Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias Nicholas II forced by the societal opposition of the 1917 Russian Revolution and the results of the World War I, he provided a military service to the 1919–1921 Polish–Soviet War and today his various merits to the locals are recognized by the Bolesław Zdziarski street in the city of Płock.\n\nFurthermore, Bolesław's paternal grandmother Barbara Zdziarska née Tokarska was a sister of a Polish jurist Michał Józef Tokarski who Germanized to Michael von Tokarski already under the Kingdom of Prussia in 1803–1806 studied law at the University of Königsberg in the East Prussia to begin practice of a court hearer in the Płock Regency of the New East Prussia. Soon after creation the Duchy of Warsaw, Tokarski was appointed a judge to the Justice Chamber of the Free Royal City of Płock in 1807 and both an assessor to the Tribunal of I Instance in Płock for the Płock Department by Duke Frederick Augustus I and a judge in the Criminal Justice Court in Toruń for the Płock Department and the Bydgoszcz Department in 1808, to become finally a prosecutor to the Criminal Court in Płock for the Płock Department and the Łomża Department for 1810–1815. Meanwhile, after the Russian Empire officially annexed majority of the Duchy of Warsaw as a result of the 1815 Congress of Vienna, he was appointed a lawyer to the Supreme Instance Court of the Congress Poland in Warsaw for 1815–1827 by the under a Russian Major General Vasily Lanskoy who in the aftermath of the Sixth Coalition victory over the First French Empire in the 1813 Battle of Lipsk also known as the Battle of the Nations became the Governor-General of the Duchy of Warsaw, in 1827 became a prosecutor general at the Appellate court of the Congress Poland in Warsaw, in 1833 was promoted to the post of a judge of the Supreme Instance Court of the Congress Poland and got the fourth highest Russian Empire's civil service rank of an Active State Councillor, by the Russian Emperor Nicholas I's appointment at the request of the Viceroy Ivan Paskevich in 1842 became a senator at the of the Governing Senate of the Russian Empire established by the Tsarist ukase of 1841 and the organic decree of 1842 as the subsequent anti-Polish repression which liquidated both the Supreme Instance Court and the Second Council of State of the Congress Poland, and was decorated the Knight of the Imperial Order of Saint Stanislaus of 1st and 2nd class and the Knight of the Imperial Order of Saint Prince Vladimir of 3rd class with a personal greatest acknowledgements by the Viceroy Paskevich. In particular, in 1824, Tokarski became more famous for defense of a Polish political activist Walerian Łukasiński, an officer of the 4th Regiment of Line Infantry of the Army of the Congress Poland in the rank of Major who created the secret organization (National Freemasonry) for 1819–1820 to replace this by the pro-independence secret organization \"\" (National Patriotic Society) in the course of secession of the members from the Grand Duchy of Posen officially annexed in 1815 by the Kingdom of Prussia from the Duchy of Warsaw to revolve against the Prussian forces in the 1846 Wielkopolska Uprising and the 1848 Poznań Uprising during the 1848 Spring of Nations when Tokarski died, whose detention by the Tsarist jurisprudence started in 1822 was updated in 1825 by the judicial sentence of 14-year imprisonment in solitary incarceration illegally prolonged until his death in 1868 at the Oreshek Fortress in Shlisselburg to make him one of the symbolic figures of the Polish struggle for independence in the 19th and 20th centuries against the Russian Empire's state authorities who regarded him as the main ringleader of the 1830–1831 November Uprising. Thanks to his dedication and loyalty to the occupation authorities of Poland, Tokarski owned landed estates and provided the parallel widespread activity in the Polish Freemasonry of the Scottish Rite, already in 1810 got the 3° (Master) along with the positions of both an active member and deputy speaker of the Saint John's German-language Symbolic Lodge \"Albertine zur Vollkommenheit\" (Albertine under Excellence) later transformed into a Polish-language Provincial Lodge \"Albertyna Doskonałości\" (Albertine of Excellence) in Płock, in 1812 got 4° (Elected Knight) along with the positions of an active member and the 1st warden of German-language works and editor of Polish-language works of this lodge, an active membership of the higher-degree Old-Scottish Lower Capitular Lodge \"Leopoldine zur Abendsonne\" (Leopoldine under the Setting Sun) later transformed into a Polish-language lodge \"Leopoldyna\" (Leopoldine) in Płock, positions of an active member of the Old-Scottish Directorate and a great archivist of the Provincial Lodge in Płock, in 1816 was appointed a Steward of the personally by the 1812–1821 Grand Master was the 1809–1813 both President of the State Council and Prime Minister of the Duchy of Warsaw as well as the 1818–1821 of the Congress Poland Count Stanisław Kostka Potocki known for his anti-clerical treatise \"\" (Journey to the Bigotry Land) and the project of abolition of religious orders in the Congress Poland which finished his governmental career in 1820, in 1819 got 4° and active membership of the Lower Capitular Lodge \"Ludzkość\" (Humanity) in Płock which continued the Leopoldine under the , an honorary membership of the Grand Capitular Lodge-Mother \"Szczere Połączenie\" (Sincere Connection) on the East of Płock, became the plenipotentiary deputy of the Saint John's German-language Symbolic Lodge \"Dreieck\" (Triangle) in Płock to the in Warsaw, got 6° (Knight of East) and an active membership of the 's Saint John's Symbolic Lodge \"Kazimierz Wielki\" (Casimir the Great) in Warsaw, in 1820 got 4° and an honorary membership of the Saint John's Symbolic Lodge \"Doskonałość\" (Excellence) in Płock which continued the Albertine of Excellence under the and co-organized the , an honorary membership of the Triangle to which he was a plenipotentiary representative in the , an active membership of the Humanity and the Sincere Connection, and continued in the Casimir the Great as an active member with 6°, in 1821 became an Old-Scottish master of the Humanity and an honorary member of the Sincere Connection, the Triangle, and the Excellence. In August 1822, the many-year Masonic support to his professional career was suddenly broken as a result of the ukase by Emperor Alexander I, who together with his father Emperor Paul I became famous as the only Russian Emperors with membership in the Russian Freemasonry, which banned all secret organizations and Freemason lodges in the Russian Empire, and, consequently, in particular dissolved the Polish Freemasonry.\n\nZofia Zdziarska had five siblings: oldest brother Bolesław Jr. was a political activist of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL) in Płock and Warszawa, third brother Wiesław was an engineer who emigrated to London, fourth brother Zdzisław was an economist and writer who participated in the 3rd Silesian Uprising, the only sister Janina Brewińska was a Warsaw dentist. Her second brother an Interwar period's communist Mirosław Paweł Zdziarski (1892–1937) was a publicist and activist of the Polish workers' movement. In September 1902, he started secondary education at the Governorate Gymnasium in Płock with Russian teaching language and old police-like restrictions against any symptoms of Polish patriotism, while yet in March 1902 the school experienced the loud student protests against humiliation of their patriotic feelings and his older brother Bolesław Jr. who at this time was also a student therein informed him of the circumstances. In 1905, the school experienced a student strike action, on 6 February the students forcefully broke the resistance of their teachers and the anti-Russification petition was read loudly and given to the headmaster, while the school's students run to other schools in Płock to gain more supporters among students. This demonstration was with active and direct participation of Bolesław Jr. and Mirosław, and, moreover, the future activists of the Polish and international workers' movement such like Julian Leszczyński-Leński who became the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) and who became the chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic in the composition of the Soviet Union. All the students were removed from the school, whereas the brothers Zdziarski not only lost the high scholarship established by Tokarski's widow Józefata née Wyrzykowska to his relatives but also never came back to the Russified school and were placed before the court of peace by the Tsarist police, but the judge declined to make a trial and sent the boys to home. In 1906, Mirosław was accepted to the then newly formed present-day , which named the Polish Gymnasium of the Polish Educational Society was a non-governmental school with Polish teaching language, lack of restrictions, and good scholarships for the best students, and the headmaster Józef Szczepański who authored handbooks in mathematics. Since 1906 Bolesław Jr. worked with Leszczyński-Leński and Figielski in the Płock branch of the SDKPiL, while Mirosław joined first the Union of Progressive Youth, which grouped the school youth of the Congress Poland and was primarily led by Leszczyński-Leński, and, since the end of 1907 when he was almost 16 years old, also the Płock branch of the PPS–Left known as the Young Faction of the PPS and formed in 1906 at the 9th Party Congress in Vienna, to which he was a member of the local committee in 1908–1910. In 1909, Mirosław was a delegate of the Union of Progressive Youth and participated in its Warsaw Congress, where together with all participants he was detained and arrested for three months by the Tsarist police. In May 1910 he matriculated, and, since certifications of the Polish-language schools were not recognized by the higher education system of the Russian Empire, he came to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and joined the Francis Joseph University in Lvov to study history at the Philosophical Faculty and continued his activity at the foreign section of the PPS–Left. In 1912 he travelled to the Congress Poland to make a secret job for the party and was detained and imprisoned in Piotrków's prison until 1914, when was sentenced to 2 years and 8 months of katorga, life settlement in Siberia, and life revocation of all rights. Soon after the outbreak of the World War I, in September 1914, he forcefully displaced by train into the depths of the Russian Empire to the city of Irkutsk, and was located in the penal colony for political prisoners, while his hometown was annexed by the Royal Prussian Army. He began to earn as a tutor, married his pupil Zenaida Kondrashev, worked for the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, then primarily under a Russian economist Yevgeni Preobrazhensky, and in 1916 the couple relocated to the modern-day Novosibirsk, until 1926 named Novonikolaevsk, where in 1917 during the February Revolution, which started the 1917 Russian Revolution against the Tsarist autocracy, he was elected a delegate to the Workers' council.\n\nIn March 1917 the couple came to Moscow, where both worked in the Historical Museum, and Mirosław actively participated in formation of the Moscow branch of the PPS–Left to which he was an executive member from May 1917 to July 1918. After the outbreak of the 1917 October Revolution, the second and final part of the 1917 Russian Revolution, the couple was involved into the organization of the coup d'état instead of a military service, and, since November, Mirosław was the secretary of the government of the Petrograd region of Moscow. After Tsarism was abolished by Vladimir Lenin's Bolsheviks, he organized and directed the Polish Commissariat in the Moscow region, and continued the work for the Historical Museum where he found abundant documentation on the advanced activities of the Tsarist political police Okhrana in the Congress Poland. After he made hearings of few former Tsarist policemen in Warsaw and Płock, he wrote a booklet on the Tsarist provocations in the Congress Poland, and, on the basis of statistical data, proved that the activities of the many-year paid provocateurs who serviced to the Tsarist police were carefully organized and contributed substantial damages on the body of Polish workers' movement. Soon after in 1918 his work was published in Petrograd by the of the People's Commissariat for Nationalities, the so-called 'three for the Polish affairs' the Director of the Cheka Felix Dzerzhinsky, a Polish aristocrat-turned-communist born Feliks Dzierżyński and nicknamed Iron Felix, along with two Polish communist activists Julian Marchlewski and Feliks Kon ordered him to return the interwar Poland for the party work, while his wife at this time already worked for the office of the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom), then newly formed to transform the Bolshevist Russia into the Soviet Union to which Poland was planned to be joined as the Polish Soviet Socialist Republic due to the activity of the short living Polish Provisional Revolutionary Committee formed in Białystok in 1920 with the head Julian Marchlewski and a member Feliks Kon. In July 1918, the couple came to Poland, and, after a German soldier detained Mirosław at the railway station in Warsaw, he was imprisoned first in the Warsaw Citadel and then in the Modlin's Internment Camp, to escape from the prison in November 1918 and come to his family in Zdziar Wielki for a shelter. After the Royal Prussian Army was disarmed and on 11 November 1918 the Regency Council of the Congress Poland appointed Józef Piłsudski the Commander-in-chief and the Chief of State of the Second Polish Republic to create – the Provisional People's Government of the Republic of Poland – under a former member of the Imperial Council (Reichsrat) of the Austro-Hungarian Empire Jędrzej Moraczewski, after visits in Płock and Włocławek to give public political speeches Mirosław came to Warsaw to meet his wife and to work for the Warsaw branch of the PPS–Left for which already on 16 December 1918 he was a delegate in the Warsaw Unifying Congress where the PPS–Left and the SDKPiL married and created the Communist Party of Poland (KPP) with an essential assistance of Dzerzhinsky and Marchlewski. After this Congress finished, he worked as an editorial board member to the KPP's central press organ \"Sztandar Socjalizmu\" (The Banner of Socialism) and for the editorial board of its illegal organ \"Czerwony Sztandar\" (The Red Banner). Zenaida focused on the KPP's youth organization, while, in the aftermath of Piłsudski's official legalization of trade unions on 8 February 1919, he organized Polish trade unions of whose the pioneering Central Commission of Class Trade Unions (KCKZZ) was formed on 12 July 1919 under Piłsudski's critic and the PPS' member Zygmunt Żuławski, and with Mirosław as the deputy of the KCKZZ's secretary and the PPS' member Antoni Zdanowski and the treasurer of the Executive Department of the KCKZZ until May 1920 when the 1st Congress of the Class Trade Unions in Warsaw transformed KCKZZ into the and Mirosław became its member. In the aftermath of the 1919–1921 Polish–Soviet War, in 1920 communist activists were massively arrested in Poland, and, among others, Mirosław was detained in June and imprisoned once again in the Warsaw Citadel, where he stayed when the Red Army troops came onto Warsaw. Soon later, he was displaced first to the Wronki Prison and then to the , from which he escaped in October 1920 to be arrested nine days later in the aftermath of his public political speech presented during the PPS–Left rally in the city of Będzin, the present-day Silesian Voivodeship. In May 1921, he was released from prison and came back to his wife in Warsaw, continued learning at the Warsaw School of Economics, where he started the study yet in October 1919 and completed education in May 1923, and also returned to his favourite work for the trade unions, which he sought as the fight for better living conditions of the working class, to be the secretary of the Professional Faculty of the Central Committee of the KPP. Zenaida stayed in Warsaw, where she studied under a famous Polish actor Aleksander Zelwerowicz at the Drama School of the Warsaw Conservatory, while her husband left Poland for the Soviet Union created on 30 December 1922, where already in September–October 1923 represented the Central Committee of the KPP as a member at the 2nd Party Congress in Moscow, accompanied by Leszczyński-Leński, which accepted the theses promoted by long time in Mirosław's articles.\n\nOn 13 May 1925, Mirosław was the chairman of the 1st National Conference of the Young Communist League of Poland as a delegate of the Central Committee of the KPP, and during his public speech therein was arrested along with all participants and placed in the General Police Headquarters on the Jerusalem Avenue in Warsaw to escape at night. In early 1924, he relocated to Lwów where under the pseudonym \"Józef Celiński\" was a member of the management of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine (KPZU), particularly in 1925 was a delegate of this party at both the 2nd KPZU Congress and the 4th KPP Congress in Moscow, and authored the propaganda pamphlets under the pseudonym \"M. Gozdawa\". His wife relocated in the vicinity of Zakopane and worked for the Wojciech Bogusławski , and soon later found a job in the press office of the Soviet Union's Embassy in Warsaw. After the conferences in Moscow, Mirosław returned to Warsaw to visit his brother Bolesław Jr. in hospital and come with wife to a theatre, but, although he attempted to escape, he was detained and placed in the Pawiak investigative prison when the 1926 May Coup d'État occurred under Piłsudski's leadership and abolished the President Stanisław Wojciechowski and the government of the Prime Minister Wincenty Witos for absence of the Polish side in the 1925 Locarno Treaties with the Weimar Republic and the 1926 Treaty of Berlin with the Soviet Union, to make Piłsudski's loyals a Lvov mathematician Kazimierz Bartel the Prime Minister of Poland and a writer Maciej Rataj the Acting President of Poland, before Piłsudski was appointed the Prime Minister in October 1926 while a chemist Ignacy Mościcki became the last President of the Second Polish Republic in June 1926 before the outbreak of the World War II in September 1939 and exile of his government to then neutral Kingdom of Romania where Mościcki was almost immediately interned and forced by France to resign. Under the charges of active involvement into the shooting of a paid provocator of the Polish secret police \"Defensive\" Józef Cechnowski by a Polish-Jewish member of the KPZU Izaak Naftali Botwin on 29 July 1925 in the court of Lviv, he was trailed and sentenced for 4 years of imprisonment at a heavy prison, where Bolesław Jr. visited him few times to be instructed how to organize his release with a help of higher state authorities, including former Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Education , but before these efforts came into effect his escape was organized by the KPP and Zenaida. During the escape Mirosław broke both ankles, and, after few months of a secret medical treatment, with a limited mobility the party comrades secretly transported him and Zenaida to Moscow, he shortly continued the cure at the Crimea, but abandoned the idea of surgical operations and used a walking stick. In Moscow he worked for the Polish-language communist press, among others the (The Soviet Tribune) for 1927–1930 and \"Myśl Bolszewicka\" (The Bolshevist Thought) for 1928–1929, during the 4th KPP Congress in 1927 in Moscow he was elected a deputy member of the Central Committee of the KPP, while during the 5th KPP Congress in August 1930 in the Peterhof Palace near Leningrad he criticized himself in the aftermath of the overwhelming criticism of the majority's views expressed by the Congress' deputies. Furthermore, he worked for the Red International of Labour Unions (Profintern) as an editor of the organization's press, the worker of its General Council, a member of its Executive Committee, and a collaborator of its general secretary Solomon Lozovsky. Also, in 1930–1937, he lectured at the Institute of Economic Sciences in Moscow, where on 10 June 1937 he was arrested after he finished a lecture.\n\nIn the course of the 1936–1938 Great Purge executed on the command of the General Secretary of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) (VKP(b)) Joseph Stalin, the Genocide of Poles in the Soviet Union (1937–1938), the largest national operation of the NKVD with around 140,000 arrests and more than 111,000 executions nicknamed the \"Polish Operation\" and implemented on the basis of the NKVD Order No. 00485 signed by the then head of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) Nikolai Yezhov, took place, and, in particular, Mirosław after a brutal investigation and fabricated trial under the charges of membership in the Polish Military Organisation was executed by a shoot in occipital bone and buried in a Soviet mass grave. Mirosław and Zinaida had a daughter, she probably died during the 1941–1944 Siege of Leningrad in the course of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union 'Operation Barbarossa', while Zinaida came back to the communist Poland where she died in 1957. In 1938, the Executive Committee of the Third International (Comintern), known as the ECCI, in Moscow chaired by a Bulgarian communist Georgi Dimitrov, who extended Leninism to make the most reactionary elements of financial capitalism the dictators of fascism, charged the interwar Poland's communist parties – the KPP, the KPZU, and, moreover, the Communist Party of Western Belorussia (KPZB) – of being lead by 'fascist agents' and disbanded them, almost all the parties' members who at the time stayed in the Soviet Union were repressed, many activists who remained in Poland were repressed in the aftermath of the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland as a part of the 1939–1944 Nazi–Soviet occupation of Poland due to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939 whose primary origins are dated back in 1918 when the Bolshevist Russia lost the Congress Poland in the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution and the 1921 Peace of Riga which ended the 1919–1921 Polish-Soviet War and established the interwar Polish-Soviet borders. In the 1950s the political climate in the Soviet Union changed – Generalissimus Stalin died in March 1953, Lieutenant General Nikita Khrushchev was appointed the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), Stalin's closest associate the NKVD chief Marshal of the Soviet Union Lavrentiy Beria along with 20 of 24 his close associates named \"Beria's gangs\" were sentenced to execution by firing squad in 1953–1956\",\" the 1956 Khrushchev Thaw started with Khrushchev's 'secret speech' On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences (1956) to a closed session of the 20th Party Congress of the CPSU in February 1956 wherein both the worship of Stalin and his criminal system called Stalinism along with deportations to gulags were officially condemned as a violation of Leninism to initiate de-Stalinization, and, moreover, Stalin's loyal NKVD agent the then chairman of the Central Committee (KC) of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) and Prime Minister of Poland Bolesław Bierut suddenly died in Moscow in two weeks after he was a guest to the 20th Congress of the CPSU and was hospitalized in the clinic for the CPSU members. Due to the June 1956 protests in Poznań done against working conditions, living standards, and the 1945–1989 Soviet occupation of Poland, brutally pacified with a help of 10,000 soldiers and 360 tanks by the order by the Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister in Marshal of Poland and Marshal of the Soviet Union Konstantin Rokossovsky and command of the Polish officers under the Soviet generals, the 1948–1956 Stalinist era in the history of Poland finished by the 1956 Gomułka Thaw started in the aftermath of the 8th Plenum of the KC PZPR which until 1970 gave the post of \"de facto\" Polish head of state the of the KC PZPR to Władysław Gomułka, a many-year and a former member of the KPP who in 1941–1942 was a member of Stalin's VKP(b) and in 1942 under the pseudonym \"Wiesław\" on Stalin's command co-installed in the occupied Poland the Polish Workers' Party (PPR) to be abolished for opposing the Soviet involvement in the Polish internal affairs, that is the so-called 'rightist-nationalist deviation', in August–September 1948 by Bierut who in December 1948 joined the PPR and the PPS to create the PZPR. Against the vote of Rokossovsky as a member of the KC PZPR and thanks to Bierut's short-time successor Edward Ochab's speech on 6 April 1956, his efforts at the 7th Plenum of the KC PZPR in July 1956, and instigation on 21 October 1956, with the support of the Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz, who in 1935 was the secretary of the Kraków branch of the PPS and in 1942–1944 was imprisoned in the Nazi concentration camps in Auschwitz and Mauthausen to lead and be reduced to the deputy Prime Minister's role in , Gomułka was rehabilitated along with the members of \"Gomułka's group\" which was ousted from power in September 1948 and included general Marian Spychalski, both them were arrested in 1951 on Bierut's command by interrogator of the Ministry of Public Security of Poland (MBP) Lieutenant Colonel Józef Światło nicknamed \"the Butcher\" whose defection to the United States military mission in the West Berlin in 1953 and further work for the Radio Free Europe were the causes to abolish the MBP in December 1954, who next was appointed the Minister of National Defence to , the Marshal of Poland in 1963, the President of the Front of National Unity in 1968–1971, and the \"de facto\" Polish head of state Chairman of the Council of State in 1968–1970 when Cyrankiewicz replaced him on this post for 1970–1972 and Gomułka's political power finished in the aftermath of the March 1968 Polish political crisis, the cause of 'anti-Zionist' Political Propaganda developed as a result of the Soviet bloc's frustration with the outcome of the Arab-Israeli 1967 Six-Day War which was doctrinally interpreted as an Israeli aggression and transformed into the anti-Semitic campaign to force emigration of the majority of Polish Jews with the support even in Gomułka's wife Zofia Gomułkowa who was born in an Orthodox Jewish family and together with her husband was arrested and imprisoned in 1951, his support to the 1960s' persecutions of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland and the Catholic intellectuals, and, moreover, his support to the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia to end the 1968 Prague Spring in August 1968 justified as the Brezhnev Doctrine on 13 November 1968 during the 5th Congress of the PZPR by the then Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, who in 1964 together with Alexei Kosygin led the removal of Khrushchev by his disregard of many high-ranking organizations within the CPSU and the Soviet government and who created the own cult of personality condemned in 1982 along with full legacy of his '\"Era of Stagnation\"' by the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to justify the liberalisation reforms \"glasnost\" (openness) and \"perestroika\" (reconstruction) which led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991.\n\nThe remarkable internationally renowned figure of the 1968 political emigration among the Polish intellectuals was an orthodox Marxist philosopher Leszek Kołakowski who first in March 1950 participated in the student conspiracy at the University of Warsaw against his teacher Władysław Tatarkiewicz for his '\"purely political speeches of the nature clearly hostile to the socialism-creating Poland\"' which in 1951 deprived him of rights to lecture and conduct classes, in 1957–1968 was the head of the Chair of History of Modern philosophy of the University of Warsaw, as a member of the PZPR worked for the of the KC PZPR under its founding director a Polish-Jewish Marxist theorist Adam Schaff, got full higher education in philosophy at the Lomonosov Moscow State University, a member of the KPP, the PPR and the PZPR, a full member of the PAS, in the 1950s in written glorified Stalin without a critique and in 1950–1952 lectured Marxism-Leninism to among others the last leader of the communist Poland Wojciech Jaruzelski, in 1956–1968 the founding director of the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the PAS, since 1969 a member of the Club of Rome, since 1989 the founding director of the , who by the 1968 anti-Zionist press campaign in Poland was removed from the KC PZPR and lacked influence on teaching philosophy in the communist Poland. Nevertheless, as a result of a strongly repulsive impression on communism in the Soviet Union of the late Stalinism got by his official academic visit to Moscow in 1950, already in 1957 Kołakowski published in Poland a four-part critique of the Soviet dogmas of Marxism, in 1965, together with a famous philosopher and logician Tadeusz Kotarbiński and his former doctoral student a sociologist and ethicist Maria Ossowska who in 1945–1948 was a teacher in ethics to Kołakowski at the University of Łódź to be banned from teaching sociology in 1952–1956 by the Communist Ideology's opposition to \"'bourgeois disciplines\"' and be appointed the head of the Section of History and Theory of Morality at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the PAS for 1952–1962 to get along with Kotarbiński the communist Poland's highest state academic award '' in 1972, wrote an opinion on the concept of news used by the defenders of the anti-communist oppositioners a leader Jacek Kuroń and an academic historian Karol Modzelewski who both were members of the PZPR since respectively 1952 and 1957 to be expulsed in 1964 and charged of \"propagation of false news\" in their open letter to the PZPR which criticized the party's political line, in 1966 was deprived of the membership of the PZPR after he gave a critical public lecture at the University of Warsaw on the 10th anniversary of the 1956 Polish October, for participation in the events of the March 1968 Polish political crisis he lost work at the University of Warsaw and was blocked in obtaining any academic post in Poland by depriving him of the rights of lecturing and publishing, was forced into exile where lectured at the McGill University in Montreal and the University of California at Berkeley to finally settle in England for work in 1972–1991 as a senior research fellow to the All Souls College of the University of Oxford, in 1976–1978 by the extensive 'handbook' \"Main Currents of Marxism\" became famous for revisionism of Marxism and criticism of Marxism, and ultimately rejected Marxism–Leninism in favour of his humanist interpretation of Marx inspired by the interpretation due to a Hungarian philosopher and one of the founders of the Western Marxism György Lukács, in 1991 was appointed a full member of the PAS. In contrary, Kołakowski's fellow student and the leader the anti-Tatarkiewicz conspiracy in October 1950 – December 1953 was a doctoral student at the Department of Philosophy of the of the KC PZPR, to become famous for the ideological fight against the Lwów–Warsaw school of thought which in 1952 included a brutal attack against the world view of its founding father Kazimierz Twardowski wherein he named his philosophy as \"extremely obscurantist, fideist, and priestly\", in 1952–1955 was an assistant professor at the Department of History of Philosophy of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Warsaw, and later was an editor to the Polish edition of the collected works by Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin, since 1953 worked for the ideological section of the PZPR's central press organ Trybuna Ludu (People's Tribune), in April 1956 called the PZPR for rehabilitation of Gomułka and later supported his reforms following the 1956 Polish October, in 1958 completed a doctoral thesis under Adam Schaff to be employed at the Section of Sociology and History of Culture of the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the PAS. Similarly to Kołakowski, other politicized academic figure of the communist Poland forced to emigration in 1968 was a sociologist Zygmunt Bauman who was born to a non-observant Polish-Jewish parents from Poznań and who in the Stalinist era was a member of the PPR since 1946 and under the pseudonym \"Semjon\" was a political officer in the rank of Major at the Internal Security Corps (KBW) of the Polish People's Army to combat the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the Home Army in 1945–1953, while yet in January 1968 abandoned membership of the PZPR by the increasing political pressure due to the purge led by the anti-Semitic leader of the hardliners faction of the PZPR and the Minister of Interior Major General Mieczysław Moczar to loss the chair at the University of Warsaw in the climax of the March 1968 events. As a result of rehabilitation of Gomułka in 1956, Rokossovsky came to Moscow to convince Khrushchev to use military forces against Poland, but, because Gomułka negotiated with the Soviets, the attempt failed and Rokossovsky was forced by Gomułka to leave Poland under the societal pressure due to the subsequent riots. Despite that Bierut along with an NKVD secret agent Marshal of Poland Michał Rola-Żymierski in 1949 gave Rokossovsky the highest military rank of Marshal of Poland and the Polish citizenship for his co-Commandership of the 1st Belorussian Front along with the Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov which by cooperation with the 1st Ukrainian Front commanded by the Soviet Marshal Ivan Konev, who together with Zhukov was instrumental in arrest and military trial of Beria to support Khrushchev, in the 1945 Vistula–Oder Offensive stamped the 1945–1989 Soviet occupation of Poland by the so-called Soviet 'liberation' of Poland from the Nazi Germany, yet in late 1956 the double Marshal and the twice Hero of the Soviet Union returned to his Motherland where his former ranks and honours were totally restored, and, after Zhukov was removed from the post of the Defence Minister of the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the Anti-Party Group affair when he defended Khrushchev against replacement by then Chairman of the Council of Ministers Marshal Nikolai Bulganin, he was appointed the Deputy Minister of Defence for November 1956 – June 1957, until October 1957 the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence, the Commander of the Transcaucasian Military District for October 1957 – January 1958, the Deputy Minister of Defence and the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence for January 1958 – April 1962, and the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence for April 1962 – August 1968. Meanwhile, yet in 1954 under Bierut, the KC PZPR created the Commission for the Affairs of Rehabilitated Persons, which, however, investigated and processed rehabilitation petitions slowly until June 1956 when the Rehabilitation Commission of the Ministry of Justice of the Polish People's Republic under Zofia Wasilkowska was established along with a special unit for treasons under the Office of the Public Prosecutor General , and among the 86 persons rehabilitated in 1956 was just Mirosław Zdziarski.\n\nThis basic historical family background was the most fundamental element in the shaping of Andrzej Grzegorczyk's further both intellectual formation and professional academic career. In particular, this heritage laid the foundations of his philosophical system which was a specific apologetics which mixed the Christian doctrine with certain elements of the Communist Ideology, the ecumenic approach towards both the Roman Catholic Church in Poland and the Russian Orthodox Church, the manifestly friendly attitude to the Eastern European countries and their national philosophers, and problems in the social assimilation in the Western European countries which served him at most for short time visits. Furthermore, this historical basis which for sure was known to his parents and adopted by his mind in the course of growing and raising, was strongly confronted against his personal experiences of the World War II, and strengthened by the impact due to his academic teachers and supervisors, both clerical and secular. In the communist Poland, on the one hand Grzegorczyk's academic roots were highly respected by the leading figures of the manifestly politically subordinated Polish Academy of Sciences as well as the related representatives of the Warsaw academia, whereas, on the other hand, the bold contribution to the politically correct history of both Soviet and Polish communism due to the Zdziarski family and the perfect Polish-Russian relations due to Tokarski was the cause for Grzegorczyk's informal political immunity with respect to the communist authorities and services, which was only consolidated by other essential contributions from his wife's family members. Despite that Grzegorczyk's noble origins which were openly unwelcome by the official Marxist doctrine of the bourgeois nationalism professed by the Polish communism, and, moreover, his controversial ideas for philosophy and education along with multiple support to anti-governmental activities among students could not be unnoticed by the academia and the state authorities, he had never been detained, arrested, interned, officially hired or expelled for political reasons, what confirms that the political protective umbrella based merely on his family's historical contribution has been well functioning for him and his family members and relatives in Poland of both communist and post-communist systems.\n\nDuring the 1939–1944 Nazi–Soviet occupation of Poland in the course of the World War II, Grzegorczyk was a voluntary member of the Home Army, the dominant Polish resistance movement formed in February 1942 by the Union of Armed Struggle and other Polish partisans with allegiance to the Polish Government-in-Exile as the armed wing of the Polish Underground State. As an insurgent of the Warsaw uprising under the pseudonym \"Bułka\", he provided a voluntary military service in the rank of Shooter in the 2nd Platoon of the Company '\"Harcerska\"' of the AK Battalion 'Gustaw' of the '\"Róg\"' Group of the Group \"'Północ\"' of the Home Army. As a result of Sonderkraftfahrzeug 301 Ausführung C Schwerer Ladungsträger Borgward B IV of the Panzer Abteilung (Funklenk) 302 on 13 August 1944 at the Jan Kiliński street in the Warsaw Old Town, which took life of more than 300 Polish partisans and civilians, he was injured in legs and placed in a field hospital. Several days later he rejoined the division, but by the health condition he did not participate in the further fights and was forced to leave Warsaw on 31 August 1944 as a civilian in the evacuation by the city canals from the Warsaw Old Town to the Warsaw Śródmieście.\n\nHe got primary education at a private School of the Roman Catholic Educational Society \"Future\", the same as for other Warsaw Uprising's insurgent a Polish politician Władysław Bartoszewski who under the pseudonym \"Teofil\" served to the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of the Headquarters of the Home Army in the rank of Corporal and in 1940–1941 was imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Since 1938, Grzegorczyk had obtained the Polish secondary underground education at the to be matriculated in May 1940 on the day of France's capitulation. In order to be saved from a forced displacement to the Nazi Germany for a forced labour, he started another education at a chemical high school and then, when the Nazi authorities allowed vocational secondary education in the occupied Poland, at a 3-year chemical school localized on the area of the Warsaw University of Technology where in 1942–1944 he was taught by the professors of this university. At the same time, he completed a clandestine higher education at two then secret Polish universities – in physics at the University of Warsaw, where physics was taught by Czesław Białobrzeski and Leonard Sosnowski, and in philosophy at the University of the Western Lands, where among others Władysław Tatarkiewicz had read to the students the parts of himself authored and then being created book \"O Szczęściu\" (Analysis of Happiness), whereas history of philosophy was lectured by his protégé a Polish-Jewish philosopher who as an insurgent of the Warsaw uprising under the pseudonym \"Noemi\" since August 1944 during the assault on the Sejm in September 1944 lost a leg and died of the heavily injures in a field hospital. At the stage of higher education, Grzegorczyk was especially attracted to logic by a broadcast lecture on stoic logic by a logician and mathematician Jan Łukasiewicz, who served as the Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Education of the Second Polish Republic in the of a pianist and composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski, led the development of a Polish curriculum which replaced the Russian–German–Austrian curricula of the Partitioned Poland and focused on the early acquisition of elementary both logic and mathematics, in 1923 was awarded the Commander's Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta by President Stanisław Wojciechowski, in 1922–1923 and 1931–1932 was a rector of the University of Warsaw, in 1938 was awarded by doctor honoris causa title of the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, and in May 1939 was elected a councillor of the as a representative of the Camp of National Unity based in the Sanation movement.\n\nPractical exercises in mathematical logic were provided by Tadeusz Kotarbiński's student , who in the late 1930s was a member of the anti-Sanation , as an insurgent of the Warsaw Uprising in the rank of Second Lieutenant was imprisoned in a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp , after liberation by the 4th Infantry Division (Jan Kiliński) of the First Polish Army immigrated to the US, where in 1948 as Henry Thadeus Hiz got a doctoral degree at the Harvard University for a thesis \"An economical foundation for arithmetic\" supervised by a famous American philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine and worked for the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Logic was also lectured therein by a Roman Catholic priest and Christian philosopher who was a student of logicians and philosophers Stanisław Leśniewski and Jan Łukasiewicz, a medical orderly in the 1919–1921 Polish–Soviet War, an organizer of the Cracow Circle for the logico-methodological analysis of the traditional metaphysics and Thomism – especially formalization of Thomas Aquinas' proofs for existence of God – in 1934 along with a Dominican monk and philosopher Józef Maria Bocheński who in 1964–1966 was a rector of the Universität Freiburg in Switzerland, a Thomist philosopher , and logician and philosopher , a member of the National Radical Camp along with Sobociński, a professor and the head of the Chair of Christian philosophy of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków since 1938 after he completed habilitation in 1937 and doctoral degree in 1927 for the thesis on modal sentences in Aristotle's logic, a prisoner of the Nazi concentration camps in Sachsenhausen and Dachau in 1939–1940 as a result of the Nazi operation \"Sonderaktion Krakau\" against the Jagiellonian University's professors, a Christian ministry chaplain to the National Armed Forces and the Home Army Sub-district IV of Warsaw Ochota, an awardee of the Cross of Valour and an insurgent of the Warsaw uprising under the pseudonym \"Jan\" who was brutally murdered in the aftermath of the fall of the last major resistance point known as the \"Reduta Wawelska\" (Wawelska Stronghold) during the August 1944's Warsaw Ochota massacre by the Russian Nazis' collaborationists of the S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A. (Russian Liberation National Army) commanded in 1942–1944 by SS-Brigadeführer Bronislav V. Kaminski, a Polish-German Russian nicknamed the \"Ochota's butcher\" who served in the Red Army during the 1917–1922 Russian Civil War to be expelled from the CPSU in 1935 and be arrested in 1937 during the Great Purge for both criticism of Stalin's policy of farm collectivisation and work with Germans and Poles. Meanwhile, psychology was taught by a Catholic priest , historian of philosophy and ethicist who in 1921 got a doctoral degree in philosophy from the Universität Freiburg in Switzerland for the critical thesis on the neo-Kantian Marburg school's approach to both Immanuel Kant's ethics as well as socialist ethics and in 1927 got a docent degree for a psychologic-epistemological study of notions and ideas at the former Faculty of Catholic Theology of the University of Warsaw to become its dean for 1938–1939 along with heading the Chair of Christian Philosophy and a Full Professor in 1947, who in 1952–1955 lectured at the John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin (KUL), and since 1954, when both the Faculty of Catholic Theology of the University of Warsaw and the Theological Faculty of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków were dissolved and transformed into the Academy of Catholic Theology (ATK) which in 1999 was renamed to the Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw, until retirement in 1964 he was the dean of the Faculty of Christian Philosophy of the ATK and the head of the Chair of Logic, General Methodology of Sciences and Epistemology. Furthermore, fine arts were lectured by a Polish art historian Michał Marian Walicki, who worked at the Department of Polish Architecture of the Warsaw Technical University in 1929–1936 and at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw in 1932–1939 and 1945–1949, was awarded by the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta in 1947 and in 1949 was arrested and imprisoned till 1953 on the grounds of both false accusations and a fabricated evidence.\n\nOn the other hand, one of Grzegorczyk's underground teachers was a philosopher of science and culture Bogdan Suchodolski, a professor at the Chair of Pedagogy of the Jan Kazimierz University of Lwów since 1938, a professor at the University of Warsaw in 1946–1970 and a member of the PAU since 1946, since 1952 a member and in 1965–1970 a deputy of scientific secretary and in 1969–1980 a member of the presidium of the PAS, in 1953–1973 the chairman of the Committee on Education Studies of the PAS, the head of the Department of History of Science and Technology of the PAS for 1958–1974 and the founding director of the Institute of Pedagogical Sciences at the for 1958–1968, since 1968 a member of the Front of National Unity (FJN), in 1983 a member of its successor the Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth (PRON) created to demonstrate unity and support for the communist Poland's both government and governing party Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) in the aftermath of the 1981–1983 martial law in Poland with a crucial role of a Polish centrist political party Alliance of Democrats and a pro-communist secular Roman Catholic organization PAX Association which in 1949 formed a publishing house , in 1985–1989 a member and a Senior Marshal of the , in 1982–1989 the chairman of the National Council of Culture created by the martial law's main author Wojciech Jaruzelski, during more than four decades of the Polish People's Republic he was awarded by the crucial state decorations such like the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, the Order of the Builders of People's Poland, the Medal of the National Education Commission, and twice the 1st class Order of the Banner of Work.\n\nSimilarly to another Polish mathematician Helena Rasiowa whose first unfinished master thesis in philosophy prepared under Jan Łukasiewicz burned with all house during the Warsaw uprising, Grzegorczyk was able to complete his originally underground education only after the World War II finished. Already in 1945 at the of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, supervised by a renowned philosopher of physics Zygmunt Michał Zawirski who in 1938–1939 was the Faculty's dean and in 1937 relocated to Kraków after uninterrupted nine years as the head of the Chair of Theory and Methodology of Sciences of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań and investigated the problems on the borderline of philosophy and physics, Grzegorczyk finished the first higher study by a magister degree in philosophy with the thesis \"The Ontology of Properties\", wherein with a help of Kotarbiński's reism, also propagated by Henryk Hiż, in the formal version by Stanisław Leśniewski, he successfully presented interpretation of Leśniewski's elementary ontology as a theory of higher logical types. Soon after graduation, he got a postgraduate scholarship targeted to the study logic and the foundations of mathematics at the University of Warsaw, and on 26 May 1950 by examinations in philosophy and chemistry he completed a doctoral degree in mathematics with the thesis \"On Topological Spaces in Topologies without Points\" supervised by a famous mathematician Andrzej Stanisław Mostowski, in 1954 awarded by Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta and in 1963 elected a real member of the PAS, who after the World War II also supervised Rasiowa's both master and doctoral theses in logic and the foundations of mathematics.\n\nAll the aforementioned teachers, both underground and post-war, by their teaching style and general attitude very deeply impacted onto Grzegorczyk's youthful mind. In his later years, the influence was strictly reflected by his various life choices, individual mental features, overall academic career both inside and outside Poland, both style and methods of research and teaching work. What is much more fundamental for his creativity, this impact straightforwardly shaped his personal world view which paradoxically mixed the ideas being in a deep mutual opposition, and resulted in the creation of a borderline philosophical system based on discrimination against the features of a human mind which are either inborn or beyond a personal choice.\n\nIn 1946–1948, he was an assistant to Władysław Tatarkiewicz, and, since at this time Tatarkiewicz was the editor-in-chief of the first Polish philosophical journal \"\" (Philosophical Review), he served also as the secretary of the editorial board. In 1948, he submitted a paper on the semantics of descriptive language to the 10th International Congress of Philosophy in Amsterdam, but, similarly to most Polish philosophers invited by the organizers or submitting papers, he did not get passport and could not participate in this event, although his abstract was included in the proceedings. This fact was the omen of a difficult political time, and at this time logic focused attention of many Polish philosophers, young Grzegorczyk selected the way of majority. Soon after completion of the doctoral degree, he was employed by the of the PAS and after 3 years he completed qualification procedure to a docent position on the basis of a book \"Some Classes of Recursive Functions\", what at this time was an equivalent of the habilitation procedure. In 1950–1968, he worked at a secondary employment for the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics of the University of Warsaw, in 1957 he was awarded by the of the Polish Mathematical Society, in 1961 he was appointed an associate professor of mathematics. In 1963, along with Andrzej Mostowski and Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski, he participated in the famous logical conference \"The Theory of Models\" at the University of California, Berkeley where he met Alfred Tarski and where his both individual research results and research results co-authored with Mostowski and Ryll-Nardzewski were the subjects of few lectures. When a famous Dutch logician Evert Willem Beth died in 1964, the University of Amsterdam offered him the position of the head of the chair after Beth, he came to Amsterdam for few months and returned to Warsaw because he could not find a mental place for himself in the Netherlands, at this time on the eve of the cultural revolution which made Amsterdam the 'magic centre' of Europe. Also in 1967 he lectured four months at the University of Amsterdam and was appointed a member and an assessor to the Division of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of science and Technology of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science, while in 1970 he lectured two months at the Sapienza University of Rome. In 1960, he contributed a philosophical essay to the festschrift volume to honor Władysław Tatarkiewicz on the occasion of his 70th birthday anniversary, whereas his father contributed Tatarkiewicz's bibliography to this volume. In the aftermath of the March 1968 Polish political crisis, as a result of a long-lasting confirmed direct involvement into the anti-governmental oppositional actions such like signing every open letter against restriction onto freedoms under communist regime, the inconvenient political circumstances motivated him to leave the University of Warsaw for the Institute of Mathematics of the PAS, where, in the 1960s, he was appointed the head of the Department of Foundations of Mathematics after Andrzej Mostowski left this position and remained the head of the Chair of Foundations of Mathematics at the University of Warsaw. In 1972, he was appointed a Full Professor, in 1973 he organized the pioneering semester in mathematical logic at the of the Institute of Mathematics of the PAS, also known as the Banach Center and formed in January 1972 by the mutual agreement between the PAS and the Bulgarian, Czechoslovak, East German, Hungarian, Romanian, and Soviet national academies of sciences, which started the 1973–1992 cyclic three-to-four-month long lectures and allowed both the logicians and philosophers of the isolated Eastern Bloc to interact with their Western colleagues. In 1974, by mutual agreement he left the Institute of Mathematics of the PAS for the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the PAS to work at the Section of Logic then headed by a model theorist Ryszard Wójcicki who founded the series \"'Trends in Logic\"' and related conferences by the institute's oldest journal \"Studia Logica: An International Journal for Symbolic Logic\", and to become the head of the Section of Ethics since 1982.\n\nOn the other hand, he was well known as an active member the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, in 1964 as one of the first Poles he appeared in the French commune Taizé, Saône-et-Loire, Burgundy to associate with an ecumenical Christian monastic group known as the Taizé Community, and this visit initiated the systematic contacts of the Polish Catholic intellectuals with this ecumenic group. He was a member of the Warsaw branch of the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia, particularly he was appointed a deputy president in 1972–1973 and a member of the government in 1973–1974 and 1976–1978, formed in 1956 after the Gomułka Thaw to stimulate independent thought and inform Polish Catholics on the Catholic philosophy in the countries outside the Eastern Bloc. Starting the 1970s, he practiced independent ecumenical activities, in particular the dialogue with the Russian Orthodox Church in Poland for which he organized encounters between the Polish Catholic intellectuals the Russian Orthodox intellectuals at his own apartment, which in the late 1970s and the early 1980s was also the location for the lectures of the Flying University organized by the . His model of the Catholic-Orthodox ecumenism found a good realization in the collaboration with the Russian Orthodox priest Alexander V. Men of Moscow, an eminent chaplain of independent Russian intellectuals who was murdered in 1990. He was a dedicated supporter of Russia and Ukraine, he felt that the Soviet Union was his second home, he actively collaborated with many Soviet and Russian scholars and claimed that Russians and Poles have a similar expression of the world and many in common by the culture. Among the anti-communist oppositionists in the Polish academia, he was well known as both supporter and propagator of the philosophy of nonviolence, a fight without making use of any kind of violence, and as the spiritual masters he followed the teachings of the leader of Indian nationalism Mahatma Gandhi, the leader in the civil rights movement Martin Luther King who got the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, as well as both and his mentor Tadeusz Kotarbiński, who in 1958–1968 was a deputy chairman to the All-Poland Committee of the Front of National Unity of the communist Poland under first Aleksander Zawadzki and then Edward Ochab.\n\nCensorship in the Polish People's Republic strictly blocked public information on Grzegorczyk, and, similarly to other Polish mathematician Stanisław Hartman of the University of Wrocław who got the Stefan Banach Prize in 1953, already in 1977 his name was enlisted for the strengthened control of the censorship. Every attempt of popularization of his name in the mass media (daily press, radio, TV, socio-political magazines) was immediately signalized to the directors of the central office of the state censorship directly controlled by the authorities of the communist party which then governed Poland. The censorship rules made exception solely for the publications in the specialist press, academic journals, and university lecture notes. However, as compared to the aforementioned famous case of Hartman, he had never been involved into a real political activity, such like direct supporting of anti-governmental student protesters, membership in oppositionist organizations, membership in a political party. Hence, he almost completely smoothly came through the communist period of Polish statehood and avoided the various unpleasant circumstances produced by the state authorities and services against their ideological enemies in the Polish academia, which usually included regular persecutions and repressions by sudden often brutal hearings, firing from a university teacher's job, ban on public lectureship, forced political emigration, internment during the period 1981–1983 of the martial law in Poland. Similarly to Hartman, for his oppositionist activity he was \"exiled\" from his alma mater to the Institute of Mathematics of the PAS. However, he always placed his personal intellectual development on the top priority, and made professional advancements both inside and outside the communist fatherland, particularly in 1979 he was elected a member of the in Paris, France with respect to which he did not hide the critical views.\n\nAfter the pioneering Revolution of 1989 in Poland, he was celebrated as an intellectual authority of the post-communist Republic of Poland. He was appointed a corresponding member of the PAU in Kraków after its finally successful restoration in 1989, and an active member of the Section of Philosophy of the of the KUL. In 1990, he took an early retirement and enhanced his organizational activity for the Polish philosophical academia as a director of research grant \"The Hundred Years of the Lwów–Warsaw School\", within which there he organized a huge conference in Warsaw and Lvov on the occasion of Kazimierz Twardowski's centenary as the head of a chair at the former Jan Kazimierz University of Lwów, and translation of his book to Ukrainian language. In 1995, he was elected the chairman of the editorial board of the restored weekly . In 1997, under the rationale \"'for his outstanding merits to the Polish science\"' President Aleksander Kwaśniewski awarded him by the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. In 1999–2003, he was both the first ever honorary member and the chairman of the , the Polish state body responsible for coordination and giving opinions on philosophical activities as well as analysis of philosophical publications and teaching programs in Poland. In 2011–2014, he was a member of the Committee of Ethics in Science of the PAS whose purpose is the diagnosis of ethical consciousness of Polish scientific community and recommendations for its improvements. In 2010, he was awarded by the honorary doctorate of the Blaise Pascal University, Clermont-Ferrand, France, whereas in 2013 he was awarded the honorary doctorate of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków . Finally, under the rationale \"'for his outstanding achievements in the scientific and didactic work, for his merits to the development of science and the activity for the democratic transformations in Poland\"' in 2014 President Bronisław Komorowski posthumously decorated him by the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta.\n\nBoth inside and outside Poland he was most known for continuation of the Interwar period's intellectual traditions of the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic, in particular with the substantial help of Grzegorczyk and other Andrzej Mostowski's student Helena Rasiowa, as well as independently Alfred Tarski's student Wanda Szmielew, Warsaw rejoined the chart of the worldly foundational studies. He shared the view of Tarski and Mostowski that logical investigations should respect deductive sciences, in particular, mathematics, and was skeptical in the matter of a value of investigations, developed by Łukasiewicz's school, which looks for the shortest logical axioms or the simplest axiomatic bases of various logical systems. It is important to notice that a role of both Grzegorczyk and Rasiowa for earlier unpublished work in computable analysis by Stanisław Mazur, a member of the Polish United Workers' Party who was a member of communist Poland's Parliament in 1947–1956 and the director of the Institute of Mathematics of the University of Warsaw in 1964–1969 awarded by the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta in 1946, the Stefan Banach Prize in 1949, and the Order of the Banner of Work in 1951 and 1954, who investigated nonlinear functional analysis and Banach algebras and who in 1936–1939 elaborated the concept of computable real numbers and functions along with Stefan Banach. It is well known that Mazur was unfortunate in extension of his pre-war work to general computable mathematical objects, and the results were successfully assembled and published only in 1963 just under edition of Grzegorczyk and Rasiowa, what had a comparatively small inﬂuence on development of computable analysis, but developed careers of both the editors at the University of Warsaw.\n\nAmong his achievements in logic, one can find the issues of computability and decidability such like recursive functions, computable analysis, axiomatic arithmetic, and concatenation theory. On the other hand, he made research in the system of logics such like logical axioms, axiomatic geometry, non-classical logics, and interpretations of logic where, in particular, he defended psychologism since the beginning of his research. His two famous articles of 1958 and 1961 co-authored with Andrzej Mostowski and Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski became the starting point for research in the axiomatic second-order arithmetic and the arithmetic with an infinite conclusion rule, in particular the 1958's paper introduces the second-order arithmetic formalized in the first-order logic wherein both numbers and number sets are taken into account. He contributed research of the fundamental importance for theoretical computer science and precursory for the computational complexity theory, in 1953 he described and investigated classes of recursive functions generated by superposition, restricted recursion and the restricted minimum operation from some prescribed basic functions which contain addition and multiplication, and satisfy the condition that every class in question includes more complicated primitive recursive functions, and he got the sub-recursive hierarchy which ﬁlls the class of primitive recursive functions and is named the Grzegorczyk hierarchy. This originally recursion-theoretic hierarchy takes into account a strictly increasing infinite sequence of classes of functions of which the sum is a class of primitive recursive functions considered earlier, the n+1-th level functions are generated by iteration of the n-th level functions the number of times indicated by one of the arguments and by the closure under primitive recursion scheme bounded from above by an already deﬁned function.\n\nIn 1964–1968, he researched relational and topological semantics for the intuitionistic logic, what in the context of the famous work due to J.C.C. McKinsey and Alfred Tarski was also a semantics for modal logic. Inspired by Paul Joseph Cohen’s notion of forcing and Evert Willem Beth's semantics for intuitionistic logic, on the basis of the Heyting arithmetic and Jaśkowski's formulation of the intuitionistic propositional calculus, he proposed the model theory for the intuitionistic logic of constant domains (CD) and found a modal formula which is valid in all partially ordered frames with descending chain condition but not in all topological spaces. Because the logic resulting from this semantics includes the intuitionistically unprovable Grzegorczyk's schema formula_1, where x is not free in a sentence A, it is stronger than intuitionistic predicate logic. He proposed the semantics as a \"'philosophically plausible formal interpretation of intuitionistic logic\"' independently of the near-contemporary work by an American philosopher and logician Saul Aaron Kripke, observed that his semantics validates the schema and modified the forcing relation for disjunctions and existential formulas to give an exact interpretation for intuitionistic predicate logic. Sabine Koppelberg née Görnemann first in her doctoral dissertation of 1969 proved completeness of a calculus related to Grzegorczyk's semantics by both Kripke's tableau method and an algebraic method which made use of a language with the logical symbols (formula_2), and then in 1971, with independent results by Dieter Klemke in 1970–1971 and Dov Gabbay in 1969, proved that addition of the scheme to intuitionistic predicate logic is suﬃcient to axiomatize Grzegorczyk's logic. Grzegorczyk's model theory has a ﬁxed constant domain and represents a static ontology, whereas Kripke's model theory involves a quasi-ordered set of classical models, where the domains can expand along the quasi-ordering, and represents an expanding ontology with new objects created in a growth of knowledge. In other words, Grzegorczyk's semantics for the intuitionistic predicate logic is the class of predicate Kripke's models which have constant domain function. From the point of view of non-classical logics, with a help of the necessity operator formula_3 sometimes denoted by formula_4, he proposed to consider formula_5 what was later called the Grzegorczyk formula/axiom, which, although that is not valid in the Lewis normal modal logic S4, when added as a new axiom schema to S4, which can be equipped into the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra, gives the intuitionistic logic which can be translated into the S4 calculus by virtue of Gödel's interpretation of an intuitionistic logic via provability operator. In particular, Krister Segerberg was the first who proposed for this emerging specific system of a modal logic the name Grzegorczyk's logic and the symbol S4Grz or S4.Grz, whereas George Boolos contributed the foundational investigation of Grzegorczyk's schema in the context of proof theory and arithmetic.\n\nIn 2005, Grzegorczyk gave a new proof of the undecidability of the ﬁrst-order functional calculus without making use of Gödel's arithmetization, and, moreover, demonstrated undecidability of a simple concatenation theory, the operations of matching two texts understood as sequences of symbols into one text with the next text being a continuation of the first one. Grzegorczyk's undecidability of Alfred Tarski's concatenation theory is based on the philosophical motivation claiming that investigation of formal systems should be done with a help of operations on visually comprehensible objects, and the most natural element of this approach is the notion of text. On his research, Tarski's simple theory is undecidable although seems to be weaker than the weak arithmetic, whereas, instead of computability, he applies more epistemological notion of the effective recognizability of properties of a text and relationships between different texts. In 2011, Grzegorczyk introduced yet one more logical system, which today is known as the Grzegorczyk non-Fregean logic or the logic of descriptions (LD), to cover the basic features of descriptive equivalence of sentences, wherein he assumed that a human language is applied primarily to form descriptions of reality represented formally by logical connectives. According to this system, the logical language is equipped in at least four logical connectives negation (¬), conjunction (∧), disjunction (∨), and equivalence (≡). Furthermore, he defined this propositional logic from scratch, argued that neither classical propositional logic nor any of its non-classical extensions can be applied as an adequate formal language of descriptions, whereas the paradoxes of implication and equivalence are due to classical logic's \"restricting itself to considering only one, admittedly the most important, parameter of the content of a claim, namely its truth value\". He rejected all the classical logical tautologies except the law of contradiction and added two logical axioms: (LD1): ≡ represents an equivalence relation and obeys the appropriate Extensionality property, that is equal descriptions can be substituted for each other, and (LD2): ≡ joins some of the Boolean properties of descriptions, such like associativity, commutativity, and idempotency of ∧ and ∨, distributivity of ∧ over ∨, distributivity of ∨ over ∧, involution of ¬ that additionally satisﬁes the De Morgan laws. His results in the concatenation theory and the propositional calculus with the descriptive equivalence connective provided an important addition to his signal achievements.\n\nBy his investigations in psychologism, he converted the paradox of Eubulides into a positive theorem (formally proved): an ideal human tackling a linguistically properly stated problem is able to think on this consistently, sincerely and fully consciously. In opposition to Alfred Tarski and other anti-psychologist logicians who taught that the natural language leads to contradiction by its very nature, he rejected this conviction and proposed a formal system of the Universal Syntax which imitates the versatility of colloquial language. On his approach, the axiomatization of quotation-operator is the best device which allows to marry logic with metalogic and prove the adequacy theorem for the notion of truth. He dealt with the problem on invasion of logic by postmodernity, because the deconstruction of logical rules is not at stake, there would be no logic, while the foundation of logic could be rocked. Despite that in the mathematical genealogy he was and a son of Andrzej Mostowski and a grandson of Alfred Tarski, he manifestly undermined and rebutted the classical anti-psychologism of modern logic. His best known logico-mathematical book is \"An Outline of Mathematical Logic: Fundamental Results and Notions Explained with All Details\" published in Polish in 1961 and in English in 1969. His book \"Fonctions Récursives\" became the standard handbook at the French universities\".\" His other book \"Zarys arytmetyki teoretycznej\" (An Outline of Theoretical Arithmetic) became the basis for the Mizar system by the University of Białystok's team of a notable computer scientist Andrzej Trybulec. In Poland, Grzegorczyk was the first who popularized logical calculus by the book \"Logika popularna\" (Popular logic), also translated into Czech in 1957 and Russian in 1965, and the problems of decidability theory by the book \"Zagadnienia rozstrzygalności\" (Decidability problems).\n\nHe studied computable real numbers, in particular provided few different definitions of these numbers and the ways to development of mathematical analysis based only on these numbers and computable functions determined on these numbers. He investigated computable functionals of higher types and proved undecidability of different weak theories such like elementary topological algebra, he considered axiomatic foundations of geometry by the means of solids instead of points, he showed that mereology is equivalent to the Boolean algebra, he approached intuitionistic logic with a help of semantics of intuitionistic propositional calculus built upon the notion of enforced recognition of sentences in the frames of cognitive procedures, what is similar to the Kripke semantics which was crated parallelly, and he studied Kotarbiński's reism. He proposed an interpretation of the Leśniewski ontology as the Boolean algebra without zero, and demonstrated the undecidability of the theory of the Boolean algebras with the operation of closure. He investigated intuitionistic logic, just a modal interpretation of the Grzegorczyk semantics for intuitionism, which predetermined the Kripke semantics, leads to the aforementioned S4.Grz. He sought logic as a vivid area placed in the mainstream of the European philosophy, and, although that he belonged to rather hermetic Lwów–Warsaw School of thought, in opposition to his intellectual masters and academic mentors he contributed the approach to logic by the means of psychology. For him, logic is a collection of principles which preserve the emphatic declarations of the majority of properly educated and free from either violation or corruption people, that is, he attributes logic to a perfect human mind formed as a result of ideal educational background, ideal upbringing process, and ideal propriety. On his idealist views, classical logic is a formal theory of existence lexicalized by the existential quantification, and all that is logical is nothing but a text. As a fervent follower of the classical Aristotelian attitude, he sought logic not only as the fundamental tool but also as the basic ontology wherein semantics dealing with human utterances is preceded by attributes of humankind such like rationality, life, and existence. In his methodological approach, logic lays the foundations of science and the overall European invention.\n\nIn the field of philosophical logic he defended the ontological interpretation of the logical laws, on the basis of his personal belief on describing the world by these laws. In a straightforward opposition to the teachings by the fathers-founders of the twentieth-century European transcendentalism a German logician Gottlob Frege and an Austrian phenomenologist Edmund Husserl, thanks to which anti-psychologism also known as logical realism or logical objectivism dominated both the common understanding of logic and the formal reasoning in logic, he defended psychologism which he approached as a thesis about dependence of the relationship of meaning and determination on the human factor and its description attributed to a human behavior, what in itself was very far from continental philosophy and appropriate to an English Enlightement philosopher John Locke and a British utilitarianist philosopher John Stuart Mill who was criticized by Husserl for the logical psychologism. According to Grzegorczyk's interpretation, any description is in a language of someone and done for someone, whereas logic is applied to describe the world strictly. As a result of such an approach, he produced the reinterpretation of the semantic antinomies which claims on limitations of applicability of concepts rather than self-contradiction of a language. Particularly, in the book \"Logic – a human affair\", by the style appropriate to Tarski, he discussed with anti-psychologism and presented the formal construction of the Universal Syntax which led him to the hypothesis '\"to say that a sentence A is true is equivalent to the statement of this sentence relativized to the domain wherein one applies the sentence A'\" which trivializes the notion of truth, but he also stated that \"'the proof of this trivialization is trivial'.\" On his approach, the liar paradox, which lays the foundations of this construction, transforms the antinomy into the hypothesis on both the human nature and human condition\": 'there is a problem about which a human can not think in an accordant, sincere, and fully conscious way, that is having full awareness of the recognized and unrecognized sentences\"'. Hence, in his fervent battle for psychologism, he linked formal logic to rather non-universal and subjective attributes of a human mind, and, moreover, claimed that anti-psychologist interpretation of meaning is inspired by the related idealist vision of the world as formed by ideally formed intellectuals. According to Grzegorczyk, independently on personal motivations for which one makes considerations, the criterion of the value of these considerations is logic, strictly speaking if a proof is logical, systematic, and self-conscious. Grzegorczyk approached logic as the morality of speech and thought, he sought in logic the foundations of moral discussions, and, therefore, made a straightforward cultivation of discrimination fully appropriate to the German idealists – he did not see a morality beyond a selected system and claimed the selected model of morality is the universal one. Despite that he conceived just logic by wide horizons, included the methodology of science into its foundations and claimed that logic is a basic component of the intellectual attitude which he identified with the European Rationalism, he limited both logic by rationalism and rationalism by logic. His model of rationalism is open to the realm of values, acquirable for a reliable knowledge, and advocates ethics in social relations, whereas logic appears therein as a pure attribute of a human mind – a rational European human. He fought for psychologism in logic, for him semantic relations are always relations for someone and are mediated by language. Consequently, paradoxes demonstrate the limits of concepts and systems rather than inconsistencies of a language.\n\nFurthermore, he contributed a series of writings in philosophical anthropology and ethics in the methodological framework of philosophy which he named \"rationalism open for values\", which was basically no more than a mixture of the Christian theology and the selected teachings of the Lwów–Warsaw school\",\" and for which he developed the selected ideas of the Marxist thought in the context of theology and philosophy\".\" The best example of the latter context is his book \"Mała propedeutyka filozofii naukowej\" (Short propedeutics of scientific philosophy) issued by the aforementioned pro-communist Catholic publisher on the eve of the fall of communism in Poland in December 1989, when the Marxist-Leninist references were removed from the July 1952 Constitution of the Polish People's Republic and the country was renamed to the Republic of Poland, the dissolution of the PZPR in late January 1990 by its last First Secretary Mieczysław Rakowski and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact on 1 July 1991 in Prague. However, Grzegorczyk yet in his 1989's book fully and fervently developed the crucial ideas of the Marxist ideology, where in particular the name '\"scientific philosophy\"' is not equal to philosophy of science understood as the standard philosophical discourse and is reserved to the unique significance of the ideological deformation of philosophy. The ideological misuses of the word '\"scientific\"' in the context of Marxism-Leninism are well-known: '\"scientific world view\"' is equal to the Marxist world view, '\"scientific religion\"' is equal to the Marxist-Leninist atheism, '\"scientific art\"' is equal to socialist realism also known as socrealism, while '\"scientific philosophy\"' is simply the synonym of both dialectical materialism and historical materialism – just making use of the term '\"scientific\"' was making the ideology. Indeed, similarly to ecumenism between different religions, this book, which met a devastative criticism by the Roman Catholic clerical scholars such like a Salesian metaphysicist of the KUL, under the brightly banners of '\"pure philosophy\"' and '\"uniform approach to philosophy which can be the basis of teaching\"' proposed no more than an ideological uniformity of philosophy without a division onto the subjective branches such like Thomism, Existentialism or Platonism in order to get the alleged advantage of '\"maximal objectivity\"' of philosophy, where Grzegorczyk approaches philosophy as merely a convention based on the alleged values such like '\"seriousness\"' and '\"sincerity\"' claimed by him as the determinants of quality of philosophizing. He did not give the explicit definitions of these alleged merits, but provided some crucial hints on what is \"'serious and sincere philosophy\"': the most general thoughts and insights concerning the world and human life, systematic cognitive activity leading to construction of a philosophical world view, the philosophical views of brilliant writers and even scholars of other disciplines who in the margins of their specialty sometimes made interesting general considerations, amateur general reflection on any topic, professional statements which give very systematic and well exhaustive reflection, texts printed in special philosophical journals, and teachings of university professors. He introduced three categories of philosophers: amateur, traditionalists and professionals, where the only latter one can be performed in the '\"scientific\"' way, that is with a help of natural science and mathematics, but he did not make a difference between a speculation attributed to amateurs and a theoretical approach attributed to philosophy understood as an academic discipline, and, for this reason, made philosophy a part of the collectivist people's culture. The crucial element of his approach is the concept of reality divided onto observable reality formed by '\"objects (things) of different properties, joined by relations, creating different sets\"' by learning of which '\"we attribute certain properties to them and combine them into sets\"', and unobservable reality '\"composed of some separate things (...) with certain properties\"', where he attempted to apply his variant of dialectical materialism to justify an undefined materialistic spiritualism usually attributed to the Marxist-Leninist atheism. Comparatively, in his other book \"Życie jako wyzwanie\" (Life as a challenge), published already in 1993 when the primary socio-economic-political transformations were just implemented in the restored Republic of Poland almost free of the fallen Soviet occupation, he presented an unambiguously liberalized ontological declaration \"'the world (...) contains objects (...) having various properties, connected by various relations, and belonging to various sets'.\" From a general philosophical point of view, this book resorted to all the basic notions such like good and evil as the links of the first semantic chain, that is the central ontological notion of an object with the notion of a state of affairs, and his analysis went further precisely along the second ontological chain, that is towards the notions of case and act. In general, the whole book reflected its author's full both conformity with and loyalty towards the economic-political transition, started with the 1990 Polish presidential election which made the leader of the anti-communist opposition and the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Lech Wałęsa the first freely elected President of the Third Republic of Poland, although until 2007 Lustration in Poland the Polish state authorities did not require a political either purge or thaw or at least a humble self-criticism among the Polish academia, and, moreover, until 2005 the successors of the PZPR – the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SdRP) in 1991 and the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) in 1999 – governed by Aleksander Kwaśniewski who won the 1995 presidential elections over Lech Wałęsa to be the 3rd President for 1995–2005 and to be instrumental in introduction of Poland into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1999 and the European Union in 2004 along with his party comrades Józef Oleksy, Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz, Leszek Miller, and Marek Belka, who were the Prime Ministers of Poland for 1995–1996, 1996–1997, 2001–2004, and 2004–2005 respectively.\n\nIn the matter of philosophical anthropology, on the basis of the ways of reasoning pivotal for the development of the European philosophy, he provided the systematic analysis of mutual relationships between the forms of thinking and cognition in the context of the beginnings of the European culture, gave precise description of the phenomenon of European rationalism, where rational means successful as well as efficient and well-founded, through joining this concept to the internal flow of intellectual life of the European civilization and to a specific literary topos, that is a place where this way of intellectual life is localized. Meanwhile, in the matter of ethics, he claimed that in a mind cleaned from egoism and disciplined by logic there should appear elements of a general human axiology whose presence in a human expression needs a deep ethical shock, experience of either own or others' strong testimony. Particularly, he sought it in the context of Christianity where cultivated saints are the sinners who came through the stage of a great internal conversion \"metanoi\" which principally demolished their earlier life's rules, and pointed out that this procedure was unsuccessfully attempted to be implemented on the area of a secular communist society. He specifically criticized mathematicians, thus including himself, by claiming that sometimes seeing on the might of mathematical brains focused on abstract problems it seemed that there is a satanic force which causes that the most able intellectually individuals are paid for the works meaningless for wellness of humans. By his ethics, he manifestly argued against his own life choices and looked for psychological either self-defense or justification, particularly he claimed that scientists are employed in an intellectual circus whenever they do not try to think on what really is worthy to do, and, for this reason, in the isolated intellectuals there should emerge a remorse and the will of more dedicated participation in realization of socially important tasks of either a country or the world, because quite well-paid mathematical games are a waste of energy which could be utilized for thinking on real actions having a good purpose. In the case of natural scientists, he claimed that they present a world view in a careless way, although by their scientific authority and reference to a concrete research they get a substantial expertise in general philosophic beliefs, but by propagation of unfriendly ways they propagate absence of precision because they avoid logical constructions of proofs in favour of a better visual impact. He sought logic as the method against epistemological particularism, for example, he claimed that a world view demands logical culture and analytic-philosophic insight, and the way against an intellectual trapping, for example, he had a radical and unpopular point of view that the only formal logic can be the security for language against the issues of a system of assessment by clear extracting, indicating and ordering. In his philosophy, a human condition is a free existence restricted by the various limitations. Accordingly, a human as an animal has the specific features, such like persistent enrichment of life quality, creation of an environment, sensitivity on values, spiritual sphere, investigating sainthood and transcendence, ability to creativity and creative thinking, and, moreover, usage of language and symbolic reasoning which gives a control over emotions. However, his psychologist approach collapses in absence of any of his determinants of a perfect human, what means that his philosophical system, including the psychologist logic, is case-dependent and applies to a selected group of humans by emergence on the basis of discrimination against intellectual features, often either inborn or independent on a personal choice.\n\nHe was interested in an ethical standpoint and the method of conflict solving known as nonviolence, what means an action without a violence. In relation to this of his research interests, he co-organized stays in Poland for a French pacifist Jean Goss and an Austrian Christian theologian and anti-war activist Hilderad Gross-Mayr, who in 2009 got the \"Pacem in Terris\" Peace and Freedom Award established by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport in the U.S. state of Iowa to commemorate Pope John XXIII's the 1963 encyclical \"Pacem in terris\" (Peace on Earth) and in 1986 along with her husband got the Pope Paul VI Teacher of Peace Award by a Catholic peace organization Pax Christi USA. In particular, at the beginning of the Polish trade union federation Independent Self-governing Labour Union \"Solidarity\", he organized the meeting of Jean Goss with the then movement leader Lech Wałęsa, who after being awarded by the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize to which the Goss couple were also nominated got also the 2001 \"Pacem in Terris\" Peace and Freedom Award to recognize his leadership non-violent attitude. The Goss couple became famous as the apostles of nonviolence, particularly for preparation of the 1986 People Power Revolution (\"'Yellow Revolution\"') in Philippines, and lobbying for recognition of the conscientious objection by the Roman Catholic Church during the 1962–1965 Second Vatican Council opened by Pope John XXIII and closed by Pope Paul VI. In 1991, just after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Grzegorczyk was instrumental in organization of a symposium in Moscow dedicated to the nonviolence philosophy with participation of the Goss couple as well as a Canadian Catholic philosopher, theologian, and humanitarian Jean Vanier who was awarded by the 2013 \"Pacem in Terris\" Peace and Freedom Award and the 2015 Templeton Prize and an American political scientist and writer on strategy of a nonviolent struggle Gene Sharp who in 1983 was the founding father of the Albert Einstein Institution to explore the methods of nonviolent resistance in conflicts and in 2009–2015 was four times nominated to the Nobel Peace Prize. Despite of some kind of liberalism present in his thought, he was a definitely radical thinker, in particular, he propagated a nonviolent dialogue with everyone including terrorists, he was particularly fervent in forcing towards both logic and dialogue with everyone, and he claimed that going towards defense in any conditions of own dignity and inventory is harmful because the Christian Doctrine of turning the other cheek is correct. He applied his ethics to a conﬂict resolution, put a particular emphasis onto to the methods of nonviolence professed by Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, the laureate of the 1965 \"Pacem in Terris\" Peace and Freedom Award, he was also one of the ﬁrst public ﬁgures in Poland who focused attention on the ecological issues, and, before it was widely understood in Poland, he popularized the warnings due to the Club of Rome which have claimed that the resources of our planet are scarce and the idea of permanent growth is dangerous.\n\nIn his philosophical marriage between religious involvement and both reism and a specific variant of naturalism, the particular position was occupied by the moral dimension of the religious study from the point of view of Christianity. In his pseudo-essays, pseudo-sermons, and pseudo-treatises collected in the book \"Moralitety\" awarded in 1987 by the prize \"Warszawska Premiera Literacka\" (Warsaw Literary Award), he emphasized the central elements of the Christian doctrine such like the radical command to give a selfless care testimony, especially with respect to an enemy. He attempted to place himself in the role of a Catholic priest who claims that a self-demolition is not important if personal intentions are not allowed to be reduced, whereas in the book \"Europa: odkrywanie sensu istnienia\" (Europe: discovering the sense of existence) he emphasized the role of a logical reasoning in the foundations of civilization achievements to give an axiological theory of history. He claimed therein that the evolutionary development of humankind is accompanied by a specific participation of divine forces into development of human cultures, especially he pointed out altruism and a voluntary service as the examples of such either biological theology or theological biology. Without taking into account directly the Roman Catholic Church's domination in Europe and its enormous impact onto the foundations of the European philosophy in the form of various intellectual restrictions, such like in the most known cases of the Italian scholar Galileo Gailei and philosopher Giordano Bruno, he claimed European scientific theories were always logically ordered and based on deduction, empiricism and phenomenology, and limited the sense of the world to nothing but seeing the world as similar to an understandable text – hence he claimed that the explored world is already a humanly ordered structure. For him, history of religion is just deepening of this sense, with Abraham placed as the initiator of a new epoch of monotheism and a biblical reasoning as a pictorial system, which both married with the ancient Greco-Roman intellectual traditionalism gives the most appropriate philosophical system.\n\nOn his theory, Jesus Christ of Nazareth appeals for a well-defined individual testimony, and the issues of a daily life are nothing when compared to the extreme situations because Christianity for him is a realization of spiritual rather than vital values. He saw the teachings of Jesus as the acceptance of the European logic, he radically saw Jesus Christ as the provider of the European moral pattern because Jesus demanded and demonstrated coherent individual testimony. According to Grzegorczyk, in a wide sense logic lays the foundations of the European rationalism, with respect to which he identified himself as a cultivator, which says that any knowledge must emerge by logic and empiricism and must go only towards the essential points. By his personal religious standpoint shared with the passion to logic, he always fought against himself and was limited to no more than two possibilities: the way of ethics and its universality and allowing the inexpressible in order to kill the conflict between a reason and religion. Thus, by his point of view, a rational theology is useless in favour of an imprecisely defined spiritual religiousness merely based on ecumenic approach to Christianity, that is for Grzegorczyk the biblical traditionalism of Catholicism losses the intellectual value when compared to the moral testimony of its creator Jesus Christ – a reason married with an openness towards values. What is more interesting for Grzegorczyk's religious creativity, although his formal membership at the Roman Catholic Church he frequently expressed critical opinions on concrete policies of this religious organization, even on the pages of free-thinkers periodicals, and, similarly to a Russian religious philosopher Vladimir Slovyov, he manifestly ignored the East–West Schism between the Roman Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity, for example he took the Eucharist sacrament at both the Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. He was a fervent follower of Roman Catholics who felt an aﬃnity to the Russian Orthodoxy, his religious reﬂection merged Christian morality to the European cultural tradition and by his views the same values lay the foundations of both Christianity and European rationalism. In his approach, history of Christianity, including its biblical roots, can be considered the history of how a sense and understanding of the world can be deepened by contemplating the sacred and transcendent.\n\nHe convinced that Modernity with its technological development creates the new challenges for humans, whose realization demands both an appropriate ethical mode, such like dedication to other and conscious self-limitations, and the rationalist standpoint. What is intriguing, in practice he realized this of his ideas for a general public in the form of a monk-like modest appearance joined with straightforward and often manifestly ignorant and arrogant if no blatant speech, which by virtue of the dogmatic Christianity could be interpreted in terms of either demonic possession or act of blasphemy. For example, in his article \"Odpowiedzialność filozofów\" (Responsibility of philosophers) he claimed that a philosopher whose texts are at the service of state authorities, creates a vicious circle of unquestionable truths which have not much in common with reality and strengthen the authorities's monopoly on a political violence, similarly to the Roman Catholic Church's theorists who referred to the holy books instead of commenting on the facts, whereas this article was published in May 1981 on the pages of the Polish Catholic quarterly \"\" with death of the Primate of Poland Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński as the main subject of the issue and on the eve of introduction of the martial law in Poland by the communist authorities to crush the political opposition. It was not the only one and episodic case when Grzegorczyk could not clearly and unambiguously decide on his intellectual position with respect to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and the political ideology of the communist state authorities. He openly presented himself in a straightforward opposition to a religious organization when it was convenient and useful to his professional activities and when it gave him a professional advance or other at least societal profit, whereas he became suddenly manifestly religious when he sought any gains to support his ideology by a religion. In particular, the latter feature was ostentatiously expressed by his idea of ecumenism between the Roman Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church, especially when he sought the profits in the academic contacts with Russian and Ukrainian academic professionals who humbly supported promotion of his borderline philosophical ideas motivated by himself arranged hospitability and grants.\n\nThe big gap in conformity with respect to both political and social association which he adopted from the Roman Catholic-oriented teachers of his war-time underground education supported by his father's attitude was completely filled with a big conformity towards his academic career based on the politicized part of the Polish academia independently on a political system of Poland, what he made with extraordinary intellectual autonomy and a coherent reasoning. Following his personal pseudo-clerical image and pseudo-homiletic written style formed on the dogmatic philosophical traditionalism appropriate to both the Fathers and Doctors of the Roman Catholic Church enriched by the arguments of neo-Thomism and Christian existentialism, he attempted to defend a manifestly old-fashioned model of academic work understood as a humble dedication to ideas and humanity rather than a professionalism. In particular, in his part of the 2005's survey \"Gdzie ta nasza filozofia?\" (Where is this Our Philosophy?) he sought new circumstances of philosophizing as generated by the current fashions and the collective factors such like massiveness of higher education and general commercialization of life, he compared the present-day both philosophers and generally all humanists to businessmen who first of all look for their personal professional success by the way of a relatively fast and an appropriately high return of the incurred hardships rather than a long and arduous effort which leads to a perfect product, and, moreover, he claimed that the sham achievements are fully able to give quite good living conditions to scientists and philosophers because social control over these products is already impossible as a result of development of an academic specialization beyond such control.\n\nFor Grzegorczyk, the greatest intellectual challenge was an axiological approach to history of the world. Taking from the Marxist sociology, he approached cultural conflict by wealth of a privileged social class as contrasted to poverty of the rest of a society marginalized and excluded from a system focusing on rich, powerful, and clever individuals. He enriched the Marxian thought by emphasis onto the role of intellectual divisions in perpetuation of conflicts, and, similarly to the creators of the Aryan race theory based on the common proto-language, contributed the Utopian necessity of a common language for agreement and reconciliation in the global scale, as well as the Utopian idea of an identical insight of all people in understanding the wholeness of human affairs. Furthermore, he attempted to convince that the suitable theoretical apparatus is the only way for the worldly peace, that since needs of everyone can not be satisfied there is the necessity to endure limitations collectively and introduce global regulations on the basis of a persuasive argument, and that a synthesis of scientific knowledge is necessary to serve the fair and peaceful coexistence, a theory solidified in 1956 by a Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in the Marxist-Leninist-inspired Soviet foreign policy at the 20th Congress of the CPSU and applied by the Soviet Union and the Soviet-allied socialist states such like the communist Poland during the 1947–1991 Cold War, especially in the phases Cold War (1953–1962) and Cold War (1962–1979). Grzegorczyk doctrinally did not respect any form of pluralism and any kind of diversity among humankind, he sought the order in a large scale uniformity which is appropriate to the political ideologies which laid the foundations of the 20th century totalitarianism in Europe – both German Nazism and Soviet communism. For this reason, implicitly, he sought the European totalitarianism as the consequence of the European cultural heritage supported by his logic. On the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, he appealed to the United Nations to take into account the principle that \"every person has the right to help any other person in a worse position than himself or herself in whatever country that person may reside\", what in 1977 met the applause due to an American-Jewish leftist philosopher and left-wing activist Noam Chomsky who published a fragment of his correspondence with Grzegorczyk.\n\nIn the aftermath of the famous 1972's report \"The Limits to Growth\" by the Club of Rome, he developed his general Utopian idea of all-human solidarity by propagation of self-limitations on consumption and combating wastefulness. In contrary to his 'general well-being' utopia, in the case of political ethics he mostly contributed to criticism of the \"Solidarity\", the Eastern bloc's first independent trade union recognized by a communist regime and created in September 1980 at the Vladimir Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk under the leadership of Lech Wałęsa, in the time when the communist Poland was strongly divided between its supporters and opponents, and when there was not a place for the 'middle option' between the yes and the no for the anti-communist opposition. Despite that Grzegorczyk at this time was not an open supporter to the Polish government, it was understood as his direct conformity with the communist authorities in the name of his false concept of peace, and, consequently, the society of the Catholic intellectuals related to the magazine \"Tygodnik Powszechny\" (The Catholic Weekly) broke collaboration with him. Moreover, although he survived the 1939–1945 Nazi–Soviet occupation of Poland and was injured as an insurgent of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, he manifestly demonstrated a glaring absence of sensitivity on the problem of the Holocaust, and also in this case his attitude entirely confirmed the crucial impact due to the war-time underground teachers of strictly nationalist-Catholic orientation. In 1993, he authored an article \"Dekalog rozumu\" (Ten commandments of reason) which proposed the moral rules \"1. You will not clap, 2. You will not whistle, 3. Listen to the content, not the tone of expression, 4. Fight with an argument, not with a human, 5. Do not flatter other and yourself, 6. Distrust other and yourself, 7. Search for what is important, 8. Try to build something better, instead to look for scapegoats, 9. Do not generalize too hastily, 10. Do not use proverbs, they are usually a stupidity of nations\", which imitated and caricatured the Ten Commandments by an Old-Testament Jewish leader Moses to ridicule the biblical foundations of Judeo-Christianity by comparing them to the academic work.\n\nGrzegorczyk had a paradoxically formed mindset, a mind which was as modal as a modal logic. By the variety of his views, he criticized and was criticized by more radical exponents of various ideological positions – Catholics disliked his contacts with Atheists, Atheists accused him of clericalism, anti-communists disliked his attempts for searching the middle position, communists questioned his defense of freedom. He wanted to marry all with everyone, but his idea of unification was able to create only a borderline philosophical system whose followers create a dramatic minority even in the academic philosophy of Poland. The unpopularity of his system is contained in the open discrimination inherited with idealism, especially the German idealism such like of Friedrich Nietzsche which served as the philosophical basis for the Nazi Germany political ideology by Adolf Hitler. His logically trivialized philosophical views were inadequate for both communists and anti-communists, for both religious and irreligious individuals, for both philosophers and scientists, because he manifestly avoided a strict association with any concrete group and, in fact, participated in a one-person struggle for independence and freedom.\n\nDespite that he was a well functioned academic personality among few major specialized groups – mathematicians, philosophers, Catholic intellectuals, people of art – and was active in the international society of socio-political activists, he solicitously worked on the public self-picture which presented him as independent on political, social, religious, and scientific relationships to get some popularity among students in the times when the Polish academia was directly dependent on the communist ideology and governed by the politicized scholars. Nevertheless, in his daily work, he tended to the goals which created the appraisal of an inexhaustible way towards extraordinary egoism and self-comfort with a help of conformity with any of the aforementioned systems, he simply used his social links and professional connections within these systems when it was necessary to him. For example, he manifestly declared in public to audiences and students that he had never tended to get any higher positions in academia, whereas actually he easily accepted all higher positions offered to him and abandoned a work only when he sought is as inconvenient with respect to his purposes, such like the cultural and political ones met in Amsterdam which were in a direct conflict with his religious and ideological views adequate to the reduced both intellectual and social expression in the communist Poland.\n\nHe had never attempted to be a favourite academic teacher, he openly avoided any close cooperations with his students and deflected their attention by lack of will to co-authorship with a parallel will to interact with them for knowing more about them, he preferred a bold individual research work although he had multiple collaborations. He was hungry for knowledge on world and people, such like in the 'ecumenic dialogue' with the Soviets and the various Polish communists, but was never able to fully follow any concrete system, had never joined any political party, and was focused merely on collecting information only for construction of a possible either critique or irony. Even those very few students who decided to prepare their doctoral dissertations under his supervising, never felt to contribute in the work of their mentor and to continue his intellectual traditionalism, because emergence of an academic school dedicated to development of his heritage in mathematics, logic, ethics, philosophy was impossible by his attitude. He was able to attract the attention of students extremely rarely, the facts say for themselves in the best way – over more than six decades of his academic work, he was able to produce no more than three doctoral students with 10–20 years of difference between the graduations, he supervised a computer scientist Stanisław Waligórski's thesis in mathematics \"Equations in closure algebras and their applications\" (1964), a Polish-Jewish philosopher and mathematician Stanisław Krajewski's thesis in logic \"Nonstandard classes of satisfiability and their applications in investigating of some extensions of axiomatic theories\" (1975), and an aesthetician Bohdan Misiuna's thesis in ethics \"Philosophical analysis of disgust phenomena and its axiological consequences\" (1992).\n\nSince the time of his underground higher education, both he had supported and he was supported primarily by the politically involved academic teachers such like Bogdan Suchodolski and also Jan Łukasiewicz. When Suchodolski organized interdisciplinary meetings for professors in the Palace of Congresses and Conferences of the PAS in Jabłonna near Warsaw in presence of a meticulously chosen audience, in particular the students who had the preferred 'social origin', then he served humbly as the pillar. In the time of the dominant socialist orthodoxy, he presented himself as the 'Jesus Christ' of the Polish humanities – for students his philosophy was beyond the bias, intellectual enslavement and hardline correctness of the state ideology. For the communist Poland's state authorities he was officially a persona non grata secured by the politically useful historical family background, whereas for the academic youth he served as the 'socrealist Messiah' against the system teachings. He was a talented speaker towards the youth, in both philosophizing and personal action he avoided biased and emotional notions, particularism, cultivation of a scheme, routine, institution in favour of an individual, and impressive words. He impacted onto an authentic individual attitude by his analytical, synthetic and globalist reasoning, criticism on own activities, selflessness in cognitive actions, promotion of a selective truth, constant attention and control over research by the selective values based on the specific union of the Christian theology and liberalized Marxist thought.\n\nOn the one hand, his style of giving opinions was particularly distinctive in both criticism and straightforwardness, often manifestly explicit and giving the impression of directly either conflicting with or fighting against the ideals which he supported theoretically, but, on the other hand, he expressed opinions only when it was fully convenient and safe for his professional and intellectual position and preserved his personal world view. His logically radicalized philosophical system was the specific mixture of the Christian theology and the Communist Ideology which directed his primary logical thought onto the intellectual margins to walk on the borderlines with a liberation theology and a religious communism, and to visit these extremist and anarchistic territories time by time for an intellectual explosion. In a clear opposition to pluralism of the world, he manifestly claimed existence of the selective values which are absolute and universal in the earthly scale. His theoretical pedagogy, more precisely philosophy of education, was based on the specific ideological mode of nonviolence philosophy, which was particularly attractive in the period of development of anti-communist opposition and political repressions in the communist Poland. He left an explicit context of the Communist Ideology in favour of his own ideology on both similarity of life and creativity, and action and rationalism which by an ecumenic approach married the Christian theology with selected concepts of Marxism with the background in logic. However, his philosophy was able to inspire educational theory and practice in Poland by freedom, tolerance, independent choice, individual rights, and the dictate of the related professional duties of an educator. On the other hand, also his ideology of democracy was attractive for some young intellectuals of the communist Poland, because it employed the concepts of a civil society and discussion community formed by a scattering between totalitarianism and anti-totalitarianism.\n\nIn 1953, he married who is an internationally renowned Polish philologist and expert in polonist linguistics, since 2001 a professor emeritus at the Section of Grammar, Semantics and Pragmatics of the Institute of Polish language of the . In 1964 she got a doctoral degree for a thesis in Polish verbs, in 1974 she completed habilitation with a book in semantic and syntactic functions of Polish adverbs, in 1976–1979 she was a deputy-director and in 1981–1984 was the director of the Institute of Polish Language, she was appointed an associate professor in 1983 and a Full Professor in 1995, and, in 1982–2001, she was the head of the Section of Grammatical Structure of Modern Polish Language. Grzegorczykowa is a full member of the Warsaw Scientific Society, in 2007–2011 she was a member the Phraseology Commission and the Commission of Language Theory, and to which in 2015–2018 has been a collaborator along with the Ethnolinguistic Commission, of the Committee of Linguistics of the PAS. In 1997–1999, she was the head of an international project in comparative lexical semantics at the University of Warsaw in collaboration with specialists from the universities of Prague, Moscow, Kiev, and Stockholm. She contributed to word formation, syntax, and semantics of Polish language, her interests were also related to slavistics, neopragmatism, and philosophy, in her investigations she made use of the methods of structural linguistics, cognitive linguistics and generative grammar. In particular, she investigated the semantic-syntactic interpretation of language and text based on the analysis of predicate-argument structures, the logical structure of Polish sentences such like reference and modality, semantic-pragmatic relationships studied in the context of the theory of speech acts and functions of language and text, linguistic foundations of cognitive science and its role for language mechanisms. By many years until retirement she was a member of the Commission of Grammatical Structure of Slavic languages of the .\n\nHer father, Polish mining engineer and industrialist Leszek Majewski, in 1920–1948 was the director of the Pruszków factory of pencils , created by his father a Polish engineer, industrialist, and writer who was a member of the Legislative Sejm (1919–1922) and the of the Second Polish Republic as a representative of the Popular National Union, and on 2 May 1924 was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta by President Stanisław Wojciechowski. Stanisław's brother a Polish scientist and novelist created the foundations of the Polish academic archeology and in 1919 was appointed the head of the Chair of Prehistoric Archeology of the University of Warsaw. Similarly to Grzegorczyk, during the World War II her older brother Second Lieutenant and Sub-Scoutmaster Jacek Majewski was an insurgent of the Warsaw uprising pseudonymed \"Sielakowa\" in the rank of acting Commander of Platoon, since 1942 he served in the Assault Groups of the Gray Ranks which was the underground paramilitary of the Polish Scouting Association, in 1944 he commanded the 1st Platoon \"Sad\" of the 2nd Company \"Rudy\" of the AK Battalion 'Zośka' of the Diversionary Brigade \"Broda 53\" of the 'Radosław' Group of the Home Army, and was killed on 31 August 1944 at during the unsuccessful attempt of transfer of the Group \"Północ\" soldiers, including young Grzegorczyk, by the city canals from the Warsaw Old Town to the Warsaw Śródmieście, and he was awarded by the Cross of Valour. Since her mother Maria née Borsuk was the only daughter of a Polish physician-surgeon Marian Stanisław Borsuk, an active member of the who in 1907–1923 was the head of the Surgical Department of the former Wolski Hospital in Warsaw and whose origins were in the Wilno Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic which is a part of the modern-day Lithuania, the family members include also her younger brother a famous Polish mathematician Karol Borsuk of the University of Warsaw and his only daughter a Polish paleontologist and phylogeneticist Maria Magdalena Borsuk-Białynicka who is a Full Professor at the . Grzegorczyk's other kins are also her husband a Polish algebraic geometer Andrzej Szczepan Białynicki-Birula who pioneered in differential algebra and is both a full member of the PAS and a Full Professor at the University of Warsaw, his older brother a Polish theoretical physicist who is a full member of the PAS with the positions of a Full Professor at the and a professor emeritus at the University of Warsaw, and his wife a Polish theoretical physicist Zofia Białynicka-Birula née Wiatr who is a Full Professor at the .\n\nGrzegorczyk had a daughter and a son. His son Tomasz Grzegorczyk, who was born in 1954 and in 2003 authored the French-Polish translation of a classical academic book in pedagogical ethics \"Le choix d'éduquer: éthique et pédagogie (1991)\" by a French theorist of education Philippe Meirieu, studied psychology at the University of Warsaw and at this time was an oppositionist student activist and under the pseudonym \"Grzegorz Tomczyk\" collaborated with the Workers' Defense Committee (KOR), a major dissident and civil organization which was founded in June–September 1976 by dominantly Jacek Kuroń as a result of Piotr Jaroszewicz's crackdown on strikes and imprisonment of striking workers under the 1970–1980 First Secretary of the KC PZPR Edward Gierek when the communist Poland had came into a multi-aspect economic crisis, was intellectually inspired by Kołakowski's 1971 essay \"Tezy o nadziei i beznadziejności\" (Theses on hope and hopelessness) published in the No. 6 of the \"Kultura paryska\" (Paris Culture) who himself in 1977–1980 officially represented the KOR in the United Kingdom and was responsible for its contacts with the Polish emigration of 1968 to give the idea of creation of the Free Trade Unions of the Coast (WZZW) in April 1978 which by the Gdańsk Agreement in August 1980 generated the Independent Self-governing Labour Union \"Solidarity\" which finished the \"Gierek Decade\". Grzegorczyk's son-in-law a Roman Catholic journalist and activist is a historian of the Roman Catholic Church graduated at the University of Warsaw who also studied at the Institute of Historical geography of the KUL, and who since 1993 has been the editor-in-chief and the president of the , is a consulor to the Polish Episcopal Conference's Council for Mass Media and the president to the Polish Episcopal Conference's Foundation for Exchange of Religious Information, since 2003 has been a co-organizer of the cross-cultural , former member of the program board of the state-funded and government-controlled Polish Television (TVP S.A.).

The DFT has been shown to account for many puzzling findings regarding human choice behavior including violations of stochastic dominance, violations of strong stochastic transitivity, violations of independence between alternatives, serial position effects on preference, speed accuracy tradeoff effects, inverse relation between probability and decision time, changes in decisions under time pressure, as well as preference reversals between choices and prices. The DFT also offers a bridge to neuroscience. Recently, the authors of decision field theory also have begun exploring a new theoretical direction called Quantum Cognition.\n\nThe name \"decision field theory\" was chosen to reflect the fact that the inspiration for this theory comes from an earlier approach - avoidance conflict model contained in Kurt Lewin's general psychological theory, which he called \"field\" theory. DFT is a member of a general class of sequential sampling models that are commonly used in a variety of fields in cognition.\n\nThe basic ideas underlying the decision process for sequential sampling models is illustrated in Figure 1 below. Suppose the decision maker is initially presented with a choice between three risky prospects, A, B, C, at time t = 0. The horizontal axis on the figure represents deliberation time (in seconds), and the vertical axis represents preference strength. Each trajectory in the figure represents the preference state for one of the risky prospects at each moment in time.\n\nIntuitively, at each moment in time, the decision maker thinks about various payoffs of each prospect, which produces an affective reaction, or valence, to each prospect. These valences are integrated across time to produce the preference state at each moment. In this example, during the early stages of processing (between 200 and 300 ms), attention is focused on advantages favoring prospect C, but later (after 600 ms) attention is shifted toward advantages favoring prospect A. The stopping rule for this process is controlled by a threshold (which is set equal to 1.0 in this example): the first prospect to reach the top threshold is accepted, which in this case is prospect A after about two seconds. Choice probability is determined by the first option to win the race and cross the upper threshold, and decision time is equal to the deliberation time required by one of the prospects to reach this threshold.\n\nThe threshold is an important parameter for controlling speed–accuracy tradeoffs. If the threshold is set to a lower value (about .30) in Figure 1, then prospect C would be chosen instead of prospect A (and done so earlier). Thus decisions can reverse under time pressure. High thresholds require a strong preference state to be reached, which allows more information about the prospects to be sampled, prolonging the deliberation process, and increasing accuracy. Low thresholds allow a weak preference state to determine the decision, which cuts off sampling information about the prospects, shortening the deliberation process, and decreasing accuracy. Under high time pressure, decision makers must choose a low threshold; but under low time pressure, a higher threshold can be used to increase accuracy. Very careful and deliberative decision makers tend to use a high threshold, and impulsive and careless decision makers use a low threshold.\nTo provide a bit more formal description of the theory, assume that the decision maker has a choice among three actions, and also suppose for simplicity that there are only four possible final outcomes. Thus each action is defined by a probability distribution across these four outcomes. The affective values produced by each payoff are represented by the values m. At any moment in time, the decision maker anticipates the payoff of each action, which produces a momentary evaluation, U(t), for action i. This momentary evaluation is an attention-weighted average of the affective evaluation of each payoff: U(t) = Σ W(t)m. The attention weight at time t, W(t), for payoff j offered by action i, is assumed to fluctuate according to a stationary stochastic process. This reflects the idea that attention is shifting from moment to moment, causing changes in the anticipated payoff of each action across time. The momentary evaluation of each action is compared with other actions to form a valence for each action at each moment, v(t) = U(t) – U.(t), where U.(t) equals the average across all the momentary actions. The valence represents the momentary advantage or disadvantage of each action. The total valence balances out to zero so that all the options cannot become attractive simultaneously. Finally, the valences are the inputs to a dynamic system that integrates the valences over time to generate the output preference states. The output preference state for action i at time t is symbolized as P(t). The dynamic system is described by the following linear stochastic difference equation for a small time step h in the deliberation process: P(t+h) = Σ sP(t)+v(t+h).The positive self feedback coefficient, s = s > 0, controls the memory for past input valences for a preference state. Values of s < 1 suggest decay in the memory or impact of previous valences over time, whereas values of s > 1 suggest growth in impact over time (primacy effects). The negative lateral feedback coefficients, s = s < 0 for i not equal to j, produce competition among actions so that the strong inhibit the weak. In other words, as preference for one action grows stronger, then this moderates the preference for other actions. The magnitudes of the lateral inhibitory coefficients are assumed to be an increasing function of the similarity between choice options. These lateral inhibitory coefficients are important for explaining context effects on preference described later. Formally, this is a Markov process; matrix formulas have been mathematically derived for computing the choice probabilities and distribution of choice response times.\n\nThe decision field theory can also be seen as a dynamic and stochastic random walk theory of decision making, presented as a model positioned between lower-level neural activation patterns and more complex notions of decision making found in psychology and economics.\n\nThe DFT is capable of explaining context effects that many decision making theories are unable to explain. \n\nMany classic probabilistic models of choice satisfy two rational types of choice principles. One principle is called independence of irrelevant alternatives, and according to this principle, if the probability of choosing option X is greater than option Y when only X,Y are available, then option X should remain more likely to be chosen over Y even when a new option Z is added to the choice set. In other words, adding an option should not change the preference relation between the original pair of options. A second principle is called regularity, and according to this principle, the probability of choosing option X from a set containing only X and Y should be greater than or equal to the probability of choosing option X from a larger set containing options X, Y, and a new option Z. In other words, adding an option should only decrease the probability of choosing one of the original pair of options. However, empirical findings obtained by consumer researchers studying human choice behavior have found systematic context effects that systematically violate both of these principles.\n\nThe first context effect is the similarity effect. This effect occurs with the introduction of a third option S that is similar to X but it is not dominated by X. For example, suppose X is a BMW, Y is a Ford focus, and S is an Audi. The Audi is similar to the BMW because both are not very economical but they are both high quality and sporty. The Ford focus is different from the BMW and Audi because it is more economical but lower quality. Suppose in a binary choice, X is chosen more frequently than Y. Next suppose a new choice set is formed by adding an option S that is similar to X. If X is similar to S, and both are very different from Y, the people tend to view X and S as one group and Y as another option. Thus the probability of Y remains the same whether S is presented as an option or not. However, the probability of X will decrease by approximately half with the introduction of S. This causes the probability of choosing X to drop below Y when S is added to the choice set. This violates the independence of irrelevant alternatives property because in a binary choice, X is chosen more frequently than Y, but when S is added, then Y is chosen more frequently than X.\n\nThe second context effect is the compromise effect. This effect occurs when an option C is added that is a compromise between X and Y. For example, when choosing between C = Honda and X = BMW, the latter is less economical but higher quality. However, if another option Y = Ford Focus is added to the choice set, then C = Honda becomes a compromise between X = BMW and Y = Ford Focus. Suppose in a binary choice, X (BMW) is chosen more often than C (Honda). But when option Y (Ford Focus) is added to the choice set, then option C (Honda) becomes the compromise between X (BMW) and Y (Ford Focus), and C is then chosen more frequently than X. This is another violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property because X is chosen more often than C in a binary choice, but C when option Y is added to the choice set, then C is chosen more often than X.\n\nThe third effect is called the attraction effect. This effect occurs when the third option D is very similar to X but D is defective compared to X. For example D may be a new sporty car developed by a new manufacturer that is similar to option X = BMW, but costs more than the BMW. Therefore, there is little or no reason to choose D over X, and in this situation D is rarely ever chosen over X. However, adding D to a choice set boosts the probability of choosing X. In particular, the probability of choosing X from a set containing X,Y,D is larger than the probability of choosing X from a set containing only X and Y. The defective option D makes X shine, and this attraction effect violates the principle of regularity, which says that adding another option cannot increase the popularity of an option over the original subset.\n\nDFT accounts for all three effects using the same principles and same parameters across all three findings. According to DFT, the attention switching mechanism is crucial for producing the similarity effect, but the lateral inhibitory connections are critical for explaining the compromise and attraction effects. If the attention switching process is eliminated, then the similarity effect disappears, and if the lateral connections are all set to zero, then the attraction and compromise effects disappear. This property of the theory entails an interesting prediction about the effects of time pressure on preferences. The contrast effects produced by lateral inhibition require time to build up, which implies that the attraction and compromise effects should become larger under prolonged deliberation (see Roe et al.2001). Alternatively, if context effects are produced by switching from a weighted average rule under binary choice to a quick heuristic strategy for the triadic choice, then these effects should get larger under time pressure. Empirical tests show that prolonging the decision process increases the effects and time pressure decreases the effects.\n\nThe Decision Field Theory has demonstrated an ability to account for a wide range of findings from behavioral decision making for which the purely algebraic and deterministic models often used in economics and psychology cannot account. Recent studies that record neural activations in non-human primates during perceptual decision making tasks have revealed that neural firing rates closely mimic the accumulation of preference theorized by behaviorally-derived diffusion models of decision making.\n\nThe decision processes of sensory-motor decisions are beginning to be fairly well understood both at the behavioral and neural levels. Typical findings indicate that neural activation regarding stimulus movement information is accumulated across time up to a threshold, and a behavioral response is made as soon as the activation in the recorded area exceeds the threshold for examples). A conclusion that one can draw is that the neural areas responsible for planning or carrying out certain actions are also responsible for deciding the action to carry out, a decidedly embodied notion.\n\nMathematically, the spike activation pattern, as well as the choice and response time distributions, can be well described by what are known as diffusion models - especially in Two-alternative forced choice tasks(see Smith & Ratcliff for a summary). Diffusion models, such as the decision field theory, can be viewed as stochastic recurrent neural network models, except that the dynamics are approximated by linear systems. The linear approximation is important for maintaining a mathematically tractable analysis of systems perturbed by noisy inputs. In addition to these neuroscience applications, diffusion models (or their discrete time, random walk, analogues) have been used by cognitive scientists to model performance in a variety of tasks ranging from sensory detection, and perceptual discrimination, to memory recognition, and categorization. Thus, diffusion models provide the potential to form a theoretical bridge between neural models of sensory-motor tasks and behavioral models of complex-cognitive tasks.\n\n"}

Unlike the Statically typed programming languages, the analysis of a Dynamic programming language has to estimate the Type system (types, variables, functions) from the code fragment semantics, as well as all Configuration files and Binary files. Dynamic Syntax Tree implementation also take into account non-static and non-typed implicit and explicit Declaration (computer programming)s, so that the resulting information covers most of readable dynamic code fragments.\n\nMapping of language constructs from a dynamic language into a Dynamic Syntax Tree (DST) is a kind of semantic analysis (compilers). Information implying from the syntax is analyzed and the results are inserted back into the same tree, but in the form of complete static information. Preprocessing the source code will create a specialized Syntax Tree for each Class found. That can be applied to traditional programming languages too, like COBOL, where Classes can be represented by Programs, Methods by calls/Performs, Parameter by Using etc.\n\nDynamic syntax trees are mostly used in program analysis and program transformation systems.\nDynamic syntax trees are data structures used in some Static program analysis tools, due to their property of fast representing an optimized structure of program code and its related Binary file.\nDynamic Syntax Tree is used by Security Reviewer and Document Reviewer core engines.\n\n\nDifferently from Abstract syntax tree and CST Parse tree, in case of huge Classes having more than 65535 objects, the DST Object Dictionary structure (68,083 nodes), will be paged into some small XML files, about 575KB sized each. The same will be done with the Dynamic Syntax Tree itself: only 4096 Classes at time will be processed, max 135KB each. There will be no case of RAM Random access memory usage over 700MB, that means it can be able to perform a Static Analysis using a low-end Windows XP notebook with 1GB of RAM and a single-core processor, and up to 5 simultaneously static analysis of different applications at time can be achieved using only a 4GB RAM, dual-core processor machine. So, performances will be scalable depending of hardware architecture, with the guarantee of performing at least a complete static analysis starting from a notebook and going up to multi-core machine. An important optimization respect than AST and CST will be the number of tree nodes. For example, GCC 2.52 from SPEC 95 Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation benchmark suite comprises 604,000 AST nodes vs only 127,067 nodes paged in 2 DST, and Word 1.1A (1990) comprises 607,700 AST nodes vs only 204,249 nodes, paged in 3 DST. GCC 2.52 is about 140,000 lines of code and Word 1.1A is about 322,000. Static Analysis processing times using DST were half an hour for GCC and 1 hour and half for Word 1.1A. Word 1.1A source was downloaded from Computer History Museum site. Some of additional information initialization can be postponed until it is requested, because not all of the source elements must be analyzed and mapped immediately.\n\n\n\n"}

As part of mathematics it is a notational subset of Ricci calculus; however, it is often used in applications in physics that do not distinguish between tangent and cotangent spaces. It was introduced to physics by Albert Einstein in 1916.\n\nAccording to this convention, when an index variable appears twice in a single term and is not otherwise defined (see free and bound variables), it implies summation of that term over all the values of the index. So where the indices can range over the set ,\n\nis simplified by the convention to:\nformula_2.\n\nThe upper indices are not exponents but are indices of coordinates, coefficients or basis vectors. That is, in this context should be understood as the second component of rather than the square of (this can occasionally lead to ambiguity). The upper index position in is because, typically, an index occurs once in an upper (superscript) and once in a lower (subscript) position in a term (see 'Application' below). And typically would be equivalent to the traditional .\n\nIn general relativity, a common convention is that \n\nIn general, indices can range over any indexing set, including an infinite set. This should not be confused with a typographically similar convention used to distinguish between tensor index notation and the closely related but distinct basis-independent abstract index notation.\n\nAn index that is summed over is a \"summation index\", in this case \". It is also called a dummy index since any symbol can replace \" without changing the meaning of the expression provided that it does not collide with index symbols in the same term.\n\nAn index that is not summed over is a \"free index\" and should appear only once per term. If such an index does appear, it usually also appears in terms belonging to the same sum, with the exception of special values such as zero.\n\nEinstein notation can be applied in slightly different ways. Typically, each index occurs once in an upper (superscript) and once in a lower (subscript) position in a term; however, the convention can be applied more generally to any repeated indices within a term. When dealing with covariant and contravariant vectors, where the position of an index also indicates the type of vector, the first case usually applies; a covariant vector can only be contracted with a contravariant vector, corresponding to summation of the products of coefficients. On the other hand, when there is a fixed coordinate basis (or when not considering coordinate vectors), one may choose to use only subscripts; see \"\" below.\n\nIn terms of covariance and contravariance of vectors, \n\nThey transform contravariantly or covariantly, respectively, with respect to change of basis.\n\nIn recognition of this fact, the following notation uses the same symbol both for a (co)vector and its \"components\", as in:\n\nwhere is the vector and are its components (not the th covector ), is the covector and are its components.\n\nIn the presence of a non-degenerate form (an isomorphism , for instance a Riemannian metric or Minkowski metric), one can raise and lower indices.\n\nA basis gives such a form (via the dual basis), hence when working on with a Euclidean metric and a fixed orthonormal basis, one has the option to work with only subscripts.\n\nHowever, if one changes coordinates, the way that coefficients change depends on the variance of the object, and one cannot ignore the distinction; see covariance and contravariance of vectors.\n\nIn the above example, vectors are represented as matrices (column vectors), while covectors are represented as matrices (row covectors).\n\nWhen using the column vector convention\n\n\n\nThe virtue of Einstein notation is that it represents the invariant quantities with a simple notation.\n\nIn physics, a scalar is invariant under transformations of basis. In particular, a Lorentz scalar is invariant under a Lorentz transformation. The individual terms in the sum are not. When the basis is changed, the \"components\" of a vector change by a linear transformation described by a matrix. This led Einstein to propose the convention that repeated indices imply the summation is to be done.\n\nAs for covectors, they change by the inverse matrix. This is designed to guarantee that the linear function associated with the covector, the sum above, is the same no matter what the basis is.\n\nThe value of the Einstein convention is that it applies to other vector spaces built from using the tensor product and duality. For example, , the tensor product of with itself, has a basis consisting of tensors of the form . Any tensor in can be written as:\n\n, the dual of , has a basis , , ..., </sup> which obeys the rule\nwhere is the Kronecker delta.

We can then write the following operations in Einstein notation as follows.\n\n\nUsing an orthogonal basis, the inner product is the sum of corresponding components multiplied together:\n\nThis can also be calculated by multiplying the covector on the vector.\n\n\nAgain using an orthogonal basis (in 3 dimensions) the cross product intrinsically involves summations over permutations of components:\n\nwhere\n\n\nThe product of a matrix with a column vector is :\n\nequivalent to\n\nThis is a special case of matrix multiplication.\n\n\nThe matrix product of two matrices and is:\n\nequivalent to\n\n\nFor a square matrix , the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, hence the sum over a common index .\n\n\nThe outer product of the column vector by the row vector yields an matrix :\n\nSince and represent two \"different\" indices, there is no summation and the indices are not eliminated by the multiplication.\n\n\nGiven a tensor, one can raise an index or lower an index by contracting the tensor with the metric tensor, .

Consider the two statements:\n\n\nAlthough these two statements are often confused with one another, they mean two different things: the first says something \"true\" about the vagaries of war; the second says something that is certainly \"false\". The difference comes from the fact that the first statement—a statement of \"subjunctive\" possibility—says something about how things \"might have been\" under counterfactual conditions, whereas the second—a statement of \"epistemic\" possibility—says something about the relation between a particular outcome (a victory by Japan) and \"our knowledge about the actual world\" (since, as it happens, we know perfectly well that that particular outcome did \"not\" actually obtain, we know that what it says is false).\n\nThe parallel distinction arises between types of conditionals (if-then statements).

It's clearly true because it expresses this epistemic relation between its antecedent (the \"if\"-clause) and its consequent (the \"then\"-clause): The antecedent, if we came to know it was true, would provide us with excellent evidence that the consequent is true. The second statement, on the other hand, expresses a causal or metaphysical relation: It says that the world was set up so that the consequent would have been made true if the antecedent were true. One will accept that second statement to the extent that one thinks the world was set up in that way. (Conspiracy theorists who think there was a back-up shooter, for instance, may accept the second statement.) \n\nBecause of these differences, epistemic possibility bears on the actual world in ways that subjunctive possibility does not. Suppose, for example, that one wants to know whether or not to take an umbrella before going outside. If one is told \"It's \"possible that\" it is raining outside\"—in the sense of epistemic possibility—then that would weigh on whether or not I take the umbrella. But if one is told that \"It's \"possible for\" it to rain outside\"—in the sense of \"metaphysical possibility\"—then one is no better off for this bit of modal enlightenment.\n\n"}

The problem was originally posed in 1916 by Fujiwara and in 1917 by Wilhelm Blaschke, Hermann Rothe, and Roland Weitzenböck. A generalization of this problem statement was answered in the negative in 1997 by Marek R. Rychlik.\n\nAn equichordal curve is a closed planar curve for which a point in the plane exists such that all chords passing through this point are equal in length. Such a point is called an equichordal point. It is easy to construct equichordal curves with a single equichordal point, particularly when the curves are symmetric; the simplest construction is a circle.\n\nIt has long only been conjectured that no convex equichordal curve with two equichordal points can exist. More generally, it was asked whether there exists a Jordan curve formula_1 with two equichordal points formula_2 and formula_3, such that the curve \nformula_1 would be star-shaped with respect to each of the two points.\n\nMany results on equichordal curves refer to their excentricity. It turns out that the smaller the excentricity, the harder it is to disprove the existence of curves with two equichordal points. It can be shown rigorously that a small excentricity means that the curve must be close to the circle.\n\nLet formula_1 be the hypothetical convex curve with two equichordal points formula_2 and formula_3.

In a stricter sense, geometric graph theory studies combinatorial and\ngeometric properties of geometric graphs, meaning graphs drawn in the Euclidean plane with possibly intersecting straight-line edges, and topological graphs, where the edges are allowed to be arbitrary continuous curves connecting the vertices, thus it is \"the theory of geometric and topological graphs\" (Pach 2013).\n\nA \"planar straight line graph\" is a graph in which the vertices are embedded as points in the Euclidean plane, and the edges are embedded as non-crossing line segments. Fáry's theorem states that any planar graph may be represented as a planar straight line graph. A triangulation is a planar straight line graph to which no more edges may be added, so called because every face is necessarily a triangle; a special case of this is the Delaunay triangulation, a graph defined from a set of points in the plane by connecting two points with an edge whenever there exists a circle containing only those two points.\n\nThe 1-skeleton of a polyhedron or polytope is the set of vertices and edges of the polytope. The skeleton of any convex polyhedron is a planar graph, and the skeleton of any \"k\"-dimensional convex polytope is a \"k\"-connected graph. Conversely, Steinitz's theorem states that any 3-connected planar graph is the skeleton of a convex polyhedron; for this reason, this class of graphs is also known as the polyhedral graphs.\n\nA \"Euclidean graph\" is a graph in which the vertices represent points in the plane, and the edges are assigned lengths equal to the Euclidean distance between those points. The Euclidean minimum spanning tree is the minimum spanning tree of a Euclidean complete graph. It is also possible to define graphs by conditions on the distances; in particular, a unit distance graph is formed by connecting pairs of points that are a unit distance apart in the plane. The Hadwiger–Nelson problem concerns the chromatic number of these graphs.\n\nAn intersection graph is a graph in which each vertex is associated with a set and in which vertices are connected by edges whenever the corresponding sets have a nonempty intersection. When the sets are geometric objects, the result is a geometric graph. For instance, the intersection graph of line segments in one dimension is an interval graph; the intersection graph of unit disks in the plane is a unit disk graph. The Circle packing theorem states that the intersection graphs of non-crossing circles are exactly the planar graphs. Scheinerman's conjecture (proven in 2009) states that every planar graph can be represented as the intersection graph of line segments in the plane.\n\nA Levi graph of a family of points and lines has a vertex for each of these objects and an edge for every incident point-line pair. The Levi graphs of projective configurations lead to many important symmetric graphs and cages.\n\nThe visibility graph of a closed polygon connects each pair of vertices by an edge whenever the line segment connecting the vertices lies entirely in the polygon. It is not known how to test efficiently whether an undirected graph can be represented as a visibility graph.\n\nA partial cube is a graph for which the vertices can be associated with the vertices of a hypercube, in such a way that distance in the graph equals Hamming distance between the corresponding hypercube vertices. Many important families of combinatorial structures, such as the acyclic orientations of a graph or the adjacencies between regions in a hyperplane arrangement, can be represented as partial cube graphs. An important special case of a partial cube is the skeleton of the permutohedron, a graph in which vertices represent permutations of a set of ordered objects and edges represent swaps of objects adjacent in the order. Several other important classes of graphs including median graphs have related definitions involving metric embeddings .\n\nA flip graph is a graph formed from the triangulations of a point set, in which each vertex represents a triangulation and two triangulations are connected by an edge if they differ by the replacement of one edge for another. It is also possible to define related flip graphs for partitions into quadrilaterals or pseudotriangles, and for higher-dimensional triangulations. The flip graph of triangulations of a convex polygon forms the skeleton of the associahedron or Stasheff polytope. The flip graph of the regular triangulations of a point set (projections of higher-dimensional convex hulls) can also be represented as a skeleton, of the so-called \"secondary polytope\".\n\n\n"}

In particular, these all use convolution to extend the group Hopf algebra from the set of functions with finite support to more useful classes of functions.\n\nFor the purposes of functional analysis, and in particular of harmonic analysis, one wishes to carry over the group ring construction to topological groups \"G\". In case \"G\" is a locally compact Hausdorff group, \"G\" carries an essentially unique left-invariant countably additive Borel measure μ called a Haar measure. Using the Haar measure, one can define a convolution operation on the space \"C\"(\"G\") of complex-valued continuous functions on \"G\" with compact support; \"C\"(\"G\") can then be given any of various norms and the completion will be a group algebra.\n\nTo define the convolution operation, let \"f\" and \"g\" be two functions in \"C\"(\"G\").

With this involution, it is a *-algebra.\n\nTheorem. With the norm:\n\n\"C\"(\"G\") becomes an involutive normed algebra with an approximate identity.\n\nThe approximate identity can be indexed on a neighborhood basis of the identity consisting of compact sets. Indeed, if \"V\" is a compact neighborhood of the identity, let \"f\" be a non-negative continuous function supported in \"V\" such that\n\nThen {\"f\"} is an approximate identity. A group algebra has an identity, as opposed to just an approximate identity, if and only if the topology on the group is the discrete topology.\n\nNote that for discrete groups, \"C\"(\"G\") is the same thing as the complex group ring C[\"G\"].\n\nThe importance of the group algebra is that it captures the unitary representation theory of \"G\" as shown in the following\n\nTheorem. Let \"G\" be a locally compact group. If \"U\" is a strongly continuous unitary representation of \"G\" on a Hilbert space \"H\", then\n\nis a non-degenerate bounded *-representation of the normed algebra \"C\"(\"G\").

In particular, π is irreducible if and only if \"U\" is irreducible.\n\nNon-degeneracy of a representation π of \"C\"(\"G\") on a Hilbert space \"H\" means that\n\nis dense in \"H\".\n\nIt is a standard theorem of measure theory that the completion of \"C\"(\"G\") in the \"L\"(\"G\") norm is isomorphic to the space \"L\"(\"G\") of equivalence classes of functions which are integrable with respect to the Haar measure, where, as usual, two functions are regarded as equivalent if and only if they differ only on a set of Haar measure zero.\n\nTheorem. \"L\"(\"G\") is a Banach *-algebra with the convolution product and involution defined above and with the \"L\" norm. \"L\"(\"G\") also has a bounded approximate identity.\n\nLet C[\"G\"] be the group ring of a discrete group \"G\".\n\nFor a locally compact group \"G\", the group C*-algebra \"C*\"(\"G\") of \"G\" is defined to be the C*-enveloping algebra of \"L\"(\"G\"), i.e. the completion of \"C\"(\"G\") with respect to the largest C*-norm:\n\nwhere π ranges over all non-degenerate *-representations of \"C\"(\"G\") on Hilbert spaces.

The reduced group C*-algebra is isomorphic to the non-reduced group C*-algebra defined above if and only if \"G\" is amenable.\n\nThe group von Neumann algebra \"W*\"(\"G\") of \"G\" is the enveloping von Neumann algebra of \"C*\"(\"G\").\n\nFor a discrete group \"G\", we can consider the Hilbert space ℓ(\"G\") for which \"G\" is an orthonormal basis. Since \"G\" operates on ℓ(\"G\") by permuting the basis vectors, we can identify the complex group ring C[\"G\"] with a subalgebra of the algebra of bounded operators on ℓ(\"G\"). The weak closure of this subalgebra, \"NG\", is a von Neumann algebra.\n\nThe center of \"NG\" can be described in terms of those elements of \"G\" whose conjugacy class is finite. In particular, if the identity element of \"G\" is the only group element with that property (that is, \"G\" has the infinite conjugacy class property), the center of \"NG\" consists only of complex multiples of the identity.\n\n\"NG\" is isomorphic to the hyperfinite type II factor if and only if \"G\" is countable, amenable, and has the infinite conjugacy class property.\n\nIn stereotype theory there is a series of natural group algebras that includes the following four main examples.\n\n\n\n\n\nA map formula_46 of a group formula_14 into an associative unital algebra formula_48 is called a \"representation of formula_14 in formula_48\", if it is a group homomorphism into the group of invertible elements of formula_48, i.e. if it satisfies the following identities:\n\nformula_52\n\nThe representation formula_53, formula_54, formula_55, formula_56 is called the \"representation as delta-functionals\".\n\nThe representations formula_57, formula_58, formula_59, are defined similarly.\n\nThe following two results distinguish the stereotype group algebras among the other models of group algebras in analysis.\n\n\n"}

After his return from the continent he continued with the Earl of Oxford until 1805, when he returned to Cambridge. At this time he wanted to enter the army, but his parents disapproved. After three years he was senior Smith's mathematical prizeman of his year (1808), Miles Bland, Charles James Blomfield and Adam Sedgwick being among the competitors. He graduated senior wrangler from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1808 and after training as a physician like his father, he turned to law.\n\nHaving taken his degree, Bickersteth was immediately elected a fellow of his college, and thereupon made up his mind to enter the profession of the law.

{"id": "1974007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974007", "title": "Independence-friendly logic", "text": "Independence-friendly logic\n\nIndependence-friendly logic (IF logic), proposed by Jaakko Hintikka and Gabriel Sandu in 1989 (), is an extension of classical first-order logic (FOL) by means of slashed quantifiers of the form formula_1 and formula_2 (formula_3 being a finite set of variables). The intended reading of formula_1 is \"there is a formula_5 which is functionally independent from the variables in formula_3\". IF logic allows one to express more general patterns of dependence between variables than those which are implicit in first-order logic. This greater level of generality leads to an actual increase in expressive power; the set of IF sentences can characterize the same classes of structures as existential second-order logic (formula_7). For example, it can express branching quantifier sentences, such as the formula formula_8 which expresses infinity in the empty signature; this cannot be done in FOL. Therefore, first-order logic cannot, in general, express this pattern of dependency, in which formula_9 depends \"only\" on formula_10 and formula_11, and formula_12 depends \"only\" on formula_13 and formula_11. IF logic is more general than branching quantifiers, for example in that it can express dependencies that are not transitive, such as in the quantifier prefix formula_15 (formula_9 depends on formula_10, and formula_13 depends on formula_9, but formula_13 does not depend on formula_10).\n\nThe introduction of IF logic was partly motivated by the attempt of extending the game-theoretical semantics of first-order logic to games of imperfect information. Indeed, a semantics for IF sentences can be given in terms of these kinds of games (or, alternatively, by means of a translation procedure to existential second-order logic). A semantics for open formulas cannot be given in the form of a Tarskian semantics (); an adequate semantics must specify what it means for a formula to be satisfied by a set of assignments of common variable domain (a \"team\") rather than satisfaction by a single assignment. Such a \"team semantics\" was developed by Hodges ().\n\nIF logic is translation equivalent, at the level of sentences, with a number of other logical systems based on team semantics, such as dependence logic, dependence-friendly logic, exclusion logic and independence logic; with the exception of the latter, IF logic is known to be equiexpressive to these logics also at the level of open formulas. However, IF logic differs from all the above-mentioned systems in that it lacks \"locality\" (the meaning of an open formula cannot be described just in terms of the free variables of the formula; it is instead dependent on the context in which the formula occurs).\n\nIF logic shares a number of metalogical properties with first-order logic, but there are some differences, including lack of closure under (classical, contradictory) negation and higher complexity for deciding the validity of formulas. Extended IF logic addresses the closure problem, but its game-theoretical semantics is more complicated, and such logic corresponds to a larger fragment of second-order logic, a proper subset of formula_22 ().\n\nHintikka has argued (e.g. in the book ) that IF and extended IF logic should be used as a basis for the foundations of mathematics; this proposal has been met in some cases with skepticism (see e.g.).\n\nA number of slightly different presentations of IF logic have appeared in the literature; here we follow.\n\nTerms and atomic formulas are defined exactly as in first-order logic with equality.\n\nFor a fixed signature σ, formulas of IF logic are defined as follows:\n\n\nThe set formula_35 of the free variables of an IF formula formula_23 is defined inductively as follows:\n\nThe last clause is the only one that differs from the clauses for first-order logic, the difference being that also the variables in the slash set formula_3 are counted as free variables.\n\nAn IF formula formula_23 such that formula_44 is an \"IF sentence\".\n\nThree main approaches have been proposed for the definition of the semantics of IF logic. The first two, based respectively on games of imperfect information and on Skolemization, are mainly used in the definition of IF sentences only. The former generalizes a similar approach, for first-order logic, which was based instead on games of \"perfect\" information.\nThe third approach, \"team semantics\", is a compositional semantics in the spirit of Tarskian semantics. However, this semantics does not define what it means for a formula to be satisfied by an assignment (rather, by a \"set\" of assignments).\nThe first two approaches were developed in earlier publications on if logic (); the third one by Hodges in 1997 ().\n\nIn this section, we differentiate the three approaches by writing distinct pedices, as in formula_45. Since the three approaches are fundamentally equivalent, only the symbol formula_46 will be used in the rest of the article.\n\nGame-Theoretical Semantics assigns truth values to IF sentences according to the properties of some 2-player games of imperfect information. \nFor ease of presentation, it is convenient to associate games not only to sentences, but also to formulas. More precisely, one defines games formula_47 for each triple formed by an IF formula formula_23, a structure formula_49, and an assignment formula_50.\n\nThe semantic game formula_47 has two players, called Eloise (or Verifier) and Abelard (or Falsifier).\n\nThe allowed moves in the semantic game formula_52 are determined by the synctactical structure of the formula under consideration.\nFor simplicity, we first assume that formula_23 is in negation normal form, with negations symbols occurring only in front of atomic subformulas.\n\n\nMore generally, if formula_23 is not in negation normal form, we can state, as a rule for negation, that, when a game formula_72 is reached, the players begin playing a dual game formula_73 in which the roles of Verifiers and Falsifier are switched.\n\nInformally, a sequence of moves in a game formula_52 is a history. At the end of each history formula_75, some subgame formula_76 is played; we call formula_77 the \"assignment associated to\" formula_75, and formula_79 the \"subformula occurrence associated to\" formula_75. The \"player associated to\" formula_75 is Eloise in case the most external logical operator in formula_79 is formula_83 or formula_84, and Abelard in case it is formula_85 or formula_86.\n\nThe set formula_75 of \"allowed moves\" in a history formula_75 is formula_49 if the most external operator of formula_79 is formula_84 or formula_86; it is formula_93 (formula_94 being any two distinct objects, symbolizing 'left' and 'right') in case the most external operator of formula_79 is formula_83 or formula_85.\n\nGiven two assignments formula_98 of same domain, and formula_99 we write formula_100 if formula_101 on any variable formula_102.\n\nImperfect information is introduced in the games by stipulating that certain histories are indistinguishable for the associated player; indistinguishable histories are said to form an 'information set'. Intuitively, if the history formula_75 is in the information set formula_104, the player associated to formula_75 does not know whether he is in formula_75 or in some other history of formula_104.\nConsider two histories formula_108 such that the associated formula_109 are identical subformula occurrences of the form formula_110 (formula_111 or formula_86); if furthermore formula_113, we write formula_114 (in case formula_111) or formula_116 (in case formula_117), in order to specify that the two histories are indistinguishable for Eloise, resp. for Abelard. We also stipulate, in general, reflexivity of this relation: if formula_118, then formula_114; and if formula_120, then formula_116.\n\nFor a fixed game formula_52, write formula_123 for the set of histories to which Eloise is associated, and similarly formula_124 for the set of histories of Abelard.\n\nA \"strategy\" for Eloise in the game formula_52 is any function that assigns, to any possible history in which it is Eloise's turn to play, a legal move; more precisely, any function formula_126 such that formula_127 for every history formula_128. One can define dually the strategies of Abelard.\n\nA strategy for Eloise is \"uniform\" if, whenever formula_114, formula_130; for Abelard, if formula_116 implies formula_130.\n\nA strategy formula_133 for Eloise is \"winning\" if Eloise wins in each terminal history that can be reached by playing according to formula_133. Similarly for Abelard.\n\nAn IF sentence formula_23 is \"true\" in a structure formula_49 (formula_137) if Eloise has a uniform winning strategy in the game formula_138. \nIt is \"false\" (formula_139) if Abelard has a winning strategy.\nIt is \"undetermined\" if neither Eloise nor Abelard has a winning strategy.\n\nThe semantics of IF logic thus defined is a conservative extension of first-order semantics, in the following sense. If formula_23 is an IF sentence with empty slash sets, associate to it the first-order formula formula_141 which is identical to it, except in that each IF quantifier formula_142 is replaced by the corresponding first-order quantifier formula_143. Then formula_137 iff formula_145 in the Tarskian sense; and formula_139 iff formula_147 in the Tarskian sense.\n\nMore general games can be used to assign a meaning to (possibly open) IF formulas; more exactly, it is possible to define what it means for an IF formula formula_23 to be satisfied, on a structure formula_49, by a \"team\" formula_150 (a set of assignments of common variable domain formula_151 and codomain formula_49).\nThe associated games formula_153 begin with the random choice of an assignment formula_154; after this initial move, the game \nformula_155 is played. The existence of a winning strategy for Eloise defines \"positive satisfaction\" (formula_156), and existence of a winning strategy for Abelard defines \"negative satisfaction\" (formula_157).\nAt this level of generality, Game-theoretical Semantics can be replaced by an algebraic approach, \"team semantics\" (defined below).\n\nA definition of truth for IF sentences can be given, alternatively, by means of a translation into existential second-order logic. The translation generalizes the Skolemization procedure of first-order logic. Falsity is defined by a dual procedure called Kreiselization.\n\nGiven an IF formula formula_23, we first define its skolemization relativized to a finite set formula_159 of variables. For every existential quantifier formula_1 occurring in formula_23, let formula_162 be a new function symbol (a \"Skolem function\"). We write formula_163 for the formula which is obtained substituting, in formula_23, all free occurrences of the variable formula_5 with the term formula_166. The Skolemization of formula_23 relative to formula_168, formula_169, is defined by the following inductive clauses:\n\n\nIf formula_23 is an IF sentence, its (unrelativized) Skolemization is defined as formula_179.\n\nGiven an IF formula formula_23, associate, to each universal quantifier formula_2 occurring in it, a new function symbol formula_182 (a \"Kreisel function\"). Then, the Kreiselization formula_183 of formula_23 relative to a finite set of variables formula_185, is defined by the following inductive clauses:\n\n\nIf formula_23 is an IF sentence, its (unrelativized) Kreiselization is defined as formula_195.\n\nGiven an IF sentence formula_23 with formula_197 existential quantifiers, a structure formula_49, and a list formula_199of formula_197 functions of appropriate arities, we denote as formula_201 the expansion of formula_49 which assigns the functions formula_199 as interpretations for the Skolem functions of formula_23.\n\nAn IF sentence is true on a structure formula_49 (formula_206) iff there is a tuple formula_199 of functions such that formula_208.\nSimilarly, formula_209 iff there is a tuple formula_199 of functions such that formula_211; and formula_212 iff neither of the previous conditions holds.\n\nFor any IF sentence, Skolem Semantics returns the same values as Game-theoretical Semantics.\n\nBy means of team semantics, it is possible to give a compositional account of the semantics of IF logic. Truth and falsity are grounded on the notion of 'satisfiability of a formula by a team'.\n\nLet formula_213 be a structure and let formula_214 be a finite set of variables. Then a team over formula_49 with domain formula_3 is a set of assignments over formula_49 with domain formula_3, that is, a set of functions formula_219 from formula_3 to formula_49.\n\nDuplicating and supplementing are two operations on teams which are related to the semantics of universal and existential quantification.\n\n\n\nIt is customary to replace repeated applications of these two operation with more succinct notations, such as formula_233 for formula_234.\n\nAs above, given two assignments formula_98 with same variable domain, we write formula_100 if formula_101 for every variable formula_102.\n\nGiven a team formula_150 on a structure formula_49 and a finite set formula_3 of variables, we say that a function formula_229 is formula_3-uniform if formula_244 whenever formula_245.\n\nTeam semantics is three-valued, in the sense that a formula may happen to be positively satisfied by a team on a given structure, or negatively satisfied by it, or neither. The semantics clauses for positive and negative satisfaction are defined by simultaneous induction on the synctactical structure of IF formulas.\n\nPositive satisfaction:\n\n\nNegative satisfaction:\n\n\nAccording to team semantics, an IF sentence formula_23 is said to be true (formula_299) on a structure formula_49 if it is satisfied on formula_49 by the singleton team formula_302, in symbols: formula_303. \nSimilarly, formula_23 is said to be false (formula_305) on formula_49 if formula_307; it is said to be undetermined (formula_308) if formula_309 and formula_310.\n\nFor any team formula_150 on a structure formula_49, and any IF formula formula_23, we have:\nformula_314 iff formula_315\nand\nformula_316 iff formula_317.\n\nFrom this it immediately follows that, for sentences formula_23, formula_319, formula_320 and formula_321.\n\nSince IF logic is, in its usual acception, three-valued, multiple notions of formula equivalence are of interest.\n\nLet formula_322 be two IF formulas.\n\nformula_323 (formula_23 \"truth entails\" formula_27) if formula_326 for any structure formula_49 and any team formula_150 such that formula_329.\n\nformula_330 (formula_23 is \"truth equivalent\" to formula_27) if formula_323 and formula_334.\n\nformula_335 (formula_23 \"falsity entails\" formula_27) if formula_338 for any structure formula_49 and any team formula_150 such that formula_329.\n\nformula_342 (formula_23 is \"falsity equivalent\" to formula_27) if formula_335 and formula_346.\n\nformula_347 (formula_23 \"strongly entails\" to formula_27) if formula_323 and formula_335.\n\nformula_352 (formula_23 is \"strongly equivalent\" to formula_27) if formula_330 and formula_342.\n\nThe definitions above specialize for IF sentences as follows.\nTwo IF sentences formula_322 are \"truth equivalent\" if they are true in the same structures; they are \"falsity equivalent\" if they are false in the same structures; they are \"strongly equivalent\" if they are both truth and falsity equivalent.\n\nIntuitively, using strong equivalence amounts to considering IF logic as 3-valued (true/undetermined/false), while truth equivalence treats IF sentences as if they were 2-valued (true/untrue).\n\nMany logical rules of IF logic can be adequately expressed only in terms of more restricted notions of equivalence, which take into account the context in which a formula might appear.\n\nFor example, if formula_168 is a finite set of variables and formula_359, one can state that formula_23 is \"truth equivalent to\" formula_27 \"relative to\" formula_168 (formula_363) in case formula_364 for any structure formula_49 and any team formula_150 \"of domain\" formula_168.\n\nIF sentences can be translated in a truth-preserving fashion into sentences of (functional) existential second-order logic (formula_368) by means of the Skolemization procedure (see above). Vice versa, every formula_368 can be translated into an IF sentence by means of a variant of the Walkoe-Enderton translation procedure for partially-ordered quantifiers (). In other words, IF logic and formula_368 are expressively equivalent at the level of sentences. This equivalence can be used to prove many of the properties that follow; they are inherited from formula_368 and in many cases similar to properties of FOL.\n\nWe denote by formula_372 a (possibly infinite) set of IF sentences.\n\n\nThe notion of satisfiability by a team has the following properties:\n\n\nSince IF formulas are satisfied by teams and formulas of classical logics are satisfied by assignments, there is no obvious intertranslation between IF formulas and formulas of some classical logic system. However, there is a translation procedure of IF formulas into \"sentences\" of \"relational\" formula_368 (actually, one distinct translation formula_401 for each finite formula_159 and for each choice of a predicate symbol formula_251 of arity formula_404). In this kind of translation, an extra n-ary predicate symbol formula_251 is used to represent an n-variable team formula_150. This is motivated by the fact that, once an ordering formula_407 of the variables of formula_151 has been fixed, it is possible to associate a relation formula_409 to the team formula_150. With this conventions, an IF formula is related to its translation thus:\nwhere formula_412 is the expansion of formula_49 that assigns formula_414 as interpretation for the predicate formula_251.\n\nThrough this correlation, it is possible to say that, on a structure formula_49, an IF formula formula_23 of n free variables \"defines\" a family of n-ary relations over formula_49 (the family of the relations formula_414 such that formula_420).\n\nIn 2009, Kontinen and Väänänen, showed, by means of a partial inverse translation procedure, that the families of relations that are definable by IF logic are exactly those that are nonempty, downward closed and definable in relational formula_368 with an extra predicate formula_251 (or, equivalently, nonempty and definable by a formula_368 sentence in which formula_251 occurs only negatively).\n\nIF logic is not closed under classical negation. The boolean closure of IF logic is known as extended IF logic and it is equivalent to a proper fragment of formula_22 (Figueira et al. 2011). Hintikka (1996, p. 196) claimed that \"virtually all of classical mathematics can in principle be done in extended IF first-order logic\".\n\nA number of properties of IF logic follow from logical equivalence with formula_7 and bring it closer to first-order logic including a compactness theorem, a Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, and a Craig interpolation theorem. (Väänänen, 2007, p. 86). However, Väänänen (2001) proved that the set of Gödel numbers of valid sentences of IF logic with at least one binary\npredicate symbol (set denoted by \"Val\") is recursively isomorphic with the corresponding set of Gödel numbers of valid (full) second-order sentences in a vocabulary that contains one binary predicate symbol (set denoted by \"Val\"). Furthermore, Väänänen showed that \"Val\" is the complete Π-definable set of integers, and that it is \"Val\" not in formula_427 for any finite \"m\" and \"n\". Väänänen (2007, pp. 136–139) summarizes the complexity results as follows:\n\nFeferman (2006) cites Väänänen's 2001 result to argue (contra Hintikka) that while satisfiability might be a first-order matter, the question of whether there is a winning strategy for Verifier over all structures in general \"lands us squarely in \"full second order logic\"\" (emphasis Feferman's). Feferman also attacked the claimed usefulness of the extended IF logic, because the sentences in formula_428 do not admit a game-theoretic interpretation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52033", "title": "Mathematical optimization", "text": "Mathematical optimization\n\nIn mathematics, computer science and operations research, mathematical optimization or mathematical programming, alternatively spelled \"optimisation\", is the selection of a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives.\n\nIn the simplest case, an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function. The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area of applied mathematics. More generally, optimization includes finding \"best available\" values of some objective function given a defined domain (or input), including a variety of different types of objective functions and different types of domains.\n\nAn optimization problem can be represented in the following way:\n\nSuch a formulation is called an optimization problem or a mathematical programming problem (a term not directly related to computer programming, but still in use for example in linear programming – see History below). Many real-world and theoretical problems may be modeled in this general framework. Problems formulated using this technique in the fields of physics and computer vision may refer to the technique as energy minimization, speaking of the value of the function formula_8 as representing the energy of the system being modeled.\n\nTypically, formula_2 is some subset of the Euclidean space formula_10, often specified by a set of \"constraints\", equalities or inequalities that the members of formula_2 have to satisfy. The domain formula_2 of formula_8 is called the \"search space\" or the \"choice set\",\nwhile the elements of formula_2 are called \"candidate solutions\" or \"feasible solutions\".\n\nThe function formula_8 is called, variously, an objective function, a loss function or cost function (minimization), a utility function or fitness function (maximization), or, in certain fields, an energy function or energy functional. A feasible solution that minimizes (or maximizes, if that is the goal) the objective function is called an \"optimal solution\".\n\nIn mathematics, conventional optimization problems are usually stated in terms of minimization. \n\nA \"local minimum\" \nformula_16\nis defined as an element for which there exists some formula_17 such that \n\nthat is to say, on some region around \nformula_16\nall of the function values are greater than or equal to the value at that element. \nLocal maxima are defined similarly.\n\nWhile a local minimum is at least as good as any nearby elements, a global minimum is at least as good as every feasible element. \nGenerally, unless both the objective function and the feasible region are convex in a minimization problem, there may be several local minima. \nIn a convex problem, if there is a local minimum that is interior (not on the edge of the set of feasible elements), it is also the global minimum, but a nonconvex problem may have more than one local minimum not all of which need be global minima.\n\nA large number of algorithms proposed for solving nonconvex problems – including the majority of commercially available solvers – are not capable of making a distinction between locally optimal solutions and globally optimal solutions, and will treat the former as actual solutions to the original problem. Global optimization is the branch of applied mathematics and numerical analysis that is concerned with the development of deterministic algorithms that are capable of guaranteeing convergence in finite time to the actual optimal solution of a nonconvex problem.\n\nOptimization problems are often expressed with special notation. Here are some examples:\n\nConsider the following notation:\n\nThis denotes the minimum value of the objective function formula_23, when choosing \"x\" from the set of real numbers formula_24. The minimum value in this case is formula_25, occurring at formula_26.\n\nSimilarly, the notation\n\nasks for the maximum value of the objective function 2\"x\", where \"x\" may be any real number. In this case, there is no such maximum as the objective function is unbounded, so the answer is \"infinity\" or \"undefined\".\n\nConsider the following notation:\nor equivalently\n\nThis represents the value (or values) of the argument formula_30 in the interval formula_31 that minimizes (or minimize) the objective function formula_32 (the actual minimum value of that function is not what the problem asks for). In this case, the answer is formula_33, since formula_26 is infeasible, i.e. does not belong to the feasible set.\n\nSimilarly, \nor equivalently\n\nrepresents the formula_37 pair (or pairs) that maximizes (or maximize) the value of the objective function formula_38, with the added constraint that formula_30 lie in the interval formula_40 (again, the actual maximum value of the expression does not matter). In this case, the solutions are the pairs of the form formula_41 and formula_42, where formula_43 ranges over all integers.\n\nOperators formula_44 and formula_45 are sometimes also written as formula_46 and formula_47, and stand for argument of the minimum and argument of the maximum.\n\nFermat and Lagrange found calculus-based formulae for identifying optima, while Newton and Gauss proposed iterative methods for moving towards an optimum.\n\nThe term \"linear programming\" for certain optimization cases was due to George B. Dantzig, although much of the theory had been introduced by Leonid Kantorovich in 1939. (\"Programming\" in this context does not refer to computer programming, but from the use of \"program\" by the United States military to refer to proposed training and logistics schedules, which were the problems Dantzig studied at that time.) Dantzig published the Simplex algorithm in 1947, and John von Neumann developed the theory of duality in the same year.\n\nOther major researchers in mathematical optimization include the following:\n\n\n\nIn a number of subfields, the techniques are designed primarily for optimization in dynamic contexts (that is, decision making over time):\n\nAdding more than one objective to an optimization problem adds complexity. For example, to optimize a structural design, one would desire a design that is both light and rigid. When two objectives conflict, a trade-off must be created. There may be one lightest design, one stiffest design, and an infinite number of designs that are some compromise of weight and rigidity. The set of trade-off designs that cannot be improved upon according to one criterion without hurting another criterion is known as the Pareto set. The curve created plotting weight against stiffness of the best designs is known as the Pareto frontier.\n\nA design is judged to be \"Pareto optimal\" (equivalently, \"Pareto efficient\" or in the Pareto set) if it is not dominated by any other design: If it is worse than another design in some respects and no better in any respect, then it is dominated and is not Pareto optimal.\n\nThe choice among \"Pareto optimal\" solutions to determine the \"favorite solution\" is delegated to the decision maker. In other words, defining the problem as multi-objective optimization signals that some information is missing: desirable objectives are given but combinations of them are not rated relative to each other. In some cases, the missing information can be derived by interactive sessions with the decision maker.\n\nMulti-objective optimization problems have been generalized further into vector optimization problems where the (partial) ordering is no longer given by the Pareto ordering.\n\nOptimization problems are often multi-modal; that is, they possess multiple good solutions. They could all be globally good (same cost function value) or there could be a mix of globally good and locally good solutions. Obtaining all (or at least some of) the multiple solutions is the goal of a multi-modal optimizer.\n\nClassical optimization techniques due to their iterative approach do not perform satisfactorily when they are used to obtain multiple solutions, since it is not guaranteed that different solutions will be obtained even with different starting points in multiple runs of the algorithm. Evolutionary algorithms, however, are a very popular approach to obtain multiple solutions in a multi-modal optimization task.\n\nThe satisfiability problem, also called the feasibility problem, is just the problem of finding any feasible solution at all without regard to objective value. This can be regarded as the special case of mathematical optimization where the objective value is the same for every solution, and thus any solution is optimal.\n\nMany optimization algorithms need to start from a feasible point. One way to obtain such a point is to relax the feasibility conditions using a slack variable; with enough slack, any starting point is feasible. Then, minimize that slack variable until slack is null or negative.\n\nThe extreme value theorem of Karl Weierstrass states that a continuous real-valued function on a compact set attains its maximum and minimum value. More generally, a lower semi-continuous function on a compact set attains its minimum; an upper semi-continuous function on a compact set attains its maximum.\n\nOne of Fermat's theorems states that optima of unconstrained problems are found at stationary points, where the first derivative or the gradient of the objective function is zero (see first derivative test). More generally, they may be found at critical points, where the first derivative or gradient of the objective function is zero or is undefined, or on the boundary of the choice set. An equation (or set of equations) stating that the first derivative(s) equal(s) zero at an interior optimum is called a 'first-order condition' or a set of first-order conditions.\n\nOptima of equality-constrained problems can be found by the Lagrange multiplier method. The optima of problems with equality and/or inequality constraints can be found using the 'Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions'.\n\nWhile the first derivative test identifies points that might be extrema, this test does not distinguish a point that is a minimum from one that is a maximum or one that is neither. When the objective function is twice differentiable, these cases can be distinguished by checking the second derivative or the matrix of second derivatives (called the Hessian matrix) in unconstrained problems, or the matrix of second derivatives of the objective function and the constraints called the bordered Hessian in constrained problems. The conditions that distinguish maxima, or minima, from other stationary points are called 'second-order conditions' (see 'Second derivative test'). If a candidate solution satisfies the first-order conditions, then satisfaction of the second-order conditions as well is sufficient to establish at least local optimality.\n\nThe envelope theorem describes how the value of an optimal solution changes when an underlying parameter changes. The process of computing this change is called comparative statics.\n\nThe maximum theorem of Claude Berge (1963) describes the continuity of an optimal solution as a function of underlying parameters.\n\nFor unconstrained problems with twice-differentiable functions, some critical points can be found by finding the points where the gradient of the objective function is zero (that is, the stationary points). More generally, a zero subgradient certifies that a local minimum has been found for minimization problems with convex functions and other locally Lipschitz functions.\n\nFurther, critical points can be classified using the definiteness of the Hessian matrix: If the Hessian is \"positive\" definite at a critical point, then the point is a local minimum; if the Hessian matrix is negative definite, then the point is a local maximum; finally, if indefinite, then the point is some kind of saddle point.\n\nConstrained problems can often be transformed into unconstrained problems with the help of Lagrange multipliers. Lagrangian relaxation can also provide approximate solutions to difficult constrained problems.\n\nWhen the objective function is convex, then any local minimum will also be a global minimum. There exist efficient numerical techniques for minimizing convex functions, such as interior-point methods.\n\nTo solve problems, researchers may use algorithms that terminate in a finite number of steps, or iterative methods that converge to a solution (on some specified class of problems), or heuristics that may provide approximate solutions to some problems (although their iterates need not converge).\n\n\nOptimization algorithm machine learning\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn optimization algorithm is a procedure which is executed iteratively by comparing various solutions till an optimum or a satisfactory solution will be found. Optimization algorithms help us to minimize or maximize an objective function E(x) which is simply a mathematical function dependent on the Model’s internal parameters which are used in computing the target values(Y) from the set of predictors(X) used in the model. There are two types of optimization algorithms which are widely used such as Zero-order algorithms, First Order Optimization Algorithms and Second Order Optimization Algorithms.\n\nZero-order algorithms\n\nZero-order (or derivative-free) algorithms use only the criterion value at some positions. It is popular when the gradient and Hessian information are difficult to obtain, e.g., no explicit function forms are given.\nFirst Order Optimization Algorithms\n\nThese algorithms minimize or maximize a Loss function E(x) using its Gradient values with respect to the parameters. Most widely used First order optimization algorithm is Gradient Descent. The First order derivative displays whether the function is decreasing or increasing at a particular point. First order Derivative basically will provide us a line which is tangential to a point on its Error Surface.\n\n\"Example\"\n\n\"Gradient descent\"\n\nIt is a first order optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. \n\nθ=θ−η⋅∇J(θ) — it is the formula of the parameter updates, where ‘η’ is the learning rate ,’∇J(θ)’ is the Gradient of Loss function-J(θ) w.r.t parameters-‘θ’.\n\nIt is the most popular Optimization algorithms used in optimizing a Neural Network. Now gradient descent is majorly used to do Weights updates in a Neural Network Model , i.e update and tune the Model’s parameters in a direction so that we can minimize the Loss function. Now we all know a Neural Network trains via a famous technique called Back-propagation , in which propagating forward calculating the dot product of Inputs signals and their corresponding Weights and then applying a activation function to those sum of products, which transforms the input signal to an output signal and also is important to model complex Non-linear functions and introduces Non-linearity to the Model which enables the Model to learn almost any arbitrary functional mapping.\n\nSecond Order Optimization Algorithms\n\nSecond-order methods use the second order derivative which is also called Hessian to minimize or maximize the loss function.The Hessian is a Matrix of Second Order Partial Derivatives. Since the second derivative is costly to compute, the second order is not used much. The second order derivative informs us whether the first derivative is increasing or decreasing which hints at the function’s curvature.It also provides us with a quadratic surface which touches the curvature of the Error Surface.\n\nThe iterative methods used to solve problems of nonlinear programming differ according to whether they evaluate Hessians, gradients, or only function values. While evaluating Hessians (H) and gradients (G) improves the rate of convergence, for functions for which these quantities exist and vary sufficiently smoothly, such evaluations increase the computational complexity (or computational cost) of each iteration. In some cases, the computational complexity may be excessively high.\n\nOne major criterion for optimizers is just the number of required function evaluations as this often is already a large computational effort, usually much more effort than within the optimizer itself, which mainly has to operate over the N variables.\nThe derivatives provide detailed information for such optimizers, but are even harder to calculate, e.g. approximating the gradient takes at least N+1 function evaluations. For approximations of the 2nd derivatives (collected in the Hessian matrix) the number of function evaluations is in the order of N². Newton's method requires the 2nd order derivates, so for each iteration the number of function calls is in the order of N², but for a simpler pure gradient optimizer it is only N. However, gradient optimizers need usually more iterations than Newton's algorithm. Which one is best with respect to the number of function calls depends on the problem itself.\n\n\nMore generally, if the objective function is not a quadratic function, then many optimization methods use other methods to ensure that some subsequence of iterations converges to an optimal solution. The first and still popular method for ensuring convergence relies on line searches, which optimize a function along one dimension. A second and increasingly popular method for ensuring convergence uses trust regions. Both line searches and trust regions are used in modern methods of non-differentiable optimization. Usually a global optimizer is much slower than advanced local optimizers (such as BFGS), so often an efficient global optimizer can be constructed by starting the local optimizer from different starting points.\n\nBesides (finitely terminating) algorithms and (convergent) iterative methods, there are heuristics. A heuristic is any algorithm which is not guaranteed (mathematically) to find the solution, but which is nevertheless useful in certain practical situations. List of some well-known heuristics:\n\nProblems in rigid body dynamics (in particular articulated rigid body dynamics) often require mathematical programming techniques, since you can view rigid body dynamics as attempting to solve an ordinary differential equation on a constraint manifold; the constraints are various nonlinear geometric constraints such as \"these two points must always coincide\", \"this surface must not penetrate any other\", or \"this point must always lie somewhere on this curve\". Also, the problem of computing contact forces can be done by solving a linear complementarity problem, which can also be viewed as a QP (quadratic programming) problem.\n\nMany design problems can also be expressed as optimization programs. This application is called design optimization. One subset is the engineering optimization, and another recent and growing subset of this field is multidisciplinary design optimization, which, while useful in many problems, has in particular been applied to aerospace engineering problems.\n\nThis approach may be applied in cosmology and astrophysics.\n\nEconomics is closely enough linked to optimization of agents that an influential definition relatedly describes economics \"qua\" science as the \"study of human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means\" with alternative uses. Modern optimization theory includes traditional optimization theory but also overlaps with game theory and the study of economic equilibria. The \"Journal of Economic Literature\" codes classify mathematical programming, optimization techniques, and related topics under .\n\nIn microeconomics, the utility maximization problem and its dual problem, the expenditure minimization problem, are economic optimization problems. Insofar as they behave consistently, consumers are assumed to maximize their utility, while firms are usually assumed to maximize their profit. Also, agents are often modeled as being risk-averse, thereby preferring to avoid risk. Asset prices are also modeled using optimization theory, though the underlying mathematics relies on optimizing stochastic processes rather than on static optimization. International trade theory also uses optimization to explain trade patterns between nations. The optimization of portfolios is an example of multi-objective optimization in economics.\n\nSince the 1970s, economists have modeled dynamic decisions over time using control theory. For example, dynamic search models are used to study labor-market behavior. A crucial distinction is between deterministic and stochastic models. Macroeconomists build dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models that describe the dynamics of the whole economy as the result of the interdependent optimizing decisions of workers, consumers, investors, and governments.\n\nSome common applications of optimization techniques in electrical engineering include active filter design, stray field reduction in superconducting magnetic energy storage systems, space mapping design of microwave structures, handset antennas, electromagnetics-based design. Electromagnetically validated design optimization of microwave components and antennas has made extensive use of an appropriate physics-based or empirical surrogate model and space mapping methodologies since the discovery of space mapping in 1993.\n\nOptimization has been widely used in civil engineering. The most common civil engineering problems that are solved by optimization are cut and fill of roads, life-cycle analysis of structures and infrastructures, resource leveling and schedule optimization.\n\nAnother field that uses optimization techniques extensively is operations research. Operations research also uses stochastic modeling and simulation to support improved decision-making. Increasingly, operations research uses stochastic programming to model dynamic decisions that adapt to events; such problems can be solved with large-scale optimization and stochastic optimization methods.\n\nMathematical optimization is used in much modern controller design. High-level controllers such as model predictive control (MPC) or real-time optimization (RTO) employ mathematical optimization. These algorithms run online and repeatedly determine values for decision variables, such as choke openings in a process plant, by iteratively solving a mathematical optimization problem including constraints and a model of the system to be controlled.\n\nOptimization techniques are regularly used in geophysical parameter estimation problems. Given a set of geophysical measurements, e.g. seismic recordings, it is common to solve for the physical properties and geometrical shapes of the underlying rocks and fluids.\n\nNonlinear optimization methods are widely used in conformational analysis.\n\nOptimization techniques are used in many facets of computational systems biology such as model building, optimal experimental design, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. Linear programming has been applied to calculate the maximal possible yields of fermentation products, and to infer gene regulatory networks from multiple microarray datasets as well as transcriptional regulatory networks from high-throughput data. Nonlinear programming has been used to analyze energy metabolism and has been applied to metabolic engineering and parameter estimation in biochemical pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods to obtain suitable (in some sense) natural extensions of optimization problems that otherwise lack of existence or stability of solutions to obtain problems with guaranteed existence of solutions and their stability in some sense (typically under various perturbation of data) are in general called relaxation. Solutions of such extended (=relaxed) problems in some sense characterizes (at least certain features) of the original problems, e.g. as far as their optimizing sequences concerns. Relaxed problems may also possesses their own natural linear structure that may yield specific optimality conditions different from optimality conditions for the original problems. \n\n\n"}

The coloring produces uses at most formula_1 colors, where formula_2 is the maximum degree of the graph. This is optimal for some graphs, and by Vizing's theorem it uses at most one color more than the optimal for all others.\n\nIt was first published by Jayadev Misra and David Gries in 1992. It is a simplification of a prior algorithm by Béla Bollobás.\n\nThis algorithm is the fastest known almost-optimal algorithm for edge coloring, executing in formula_3 time. A faster time bound of formula_4 was claimed in a 1985 technical report by Gabow et al., but this has never been published.\n\nIn general, optimal edge coloring is NP-complete, so it is very unlikely that a polynomial time algorithm exists. There are however exponential time exact edge coloring algorithms that give an optimal solution.\n\nA color \"x\" is said to be free of an edge (\"u,v\") on \"u\" if \"c(u,z)\" ≠ \"x\" for all (u,z) formula_5 E(G) : \"z≠v\".\n\nA fan of a vertex u is a sequence of vertices F[1:k] that satisfies the following conditions:\n\nGiven a fan F, any edge (F[i], X) for 1 ≤ i ≤ k is a fan edge. Let c and d be colors. A cd-path is an edge path that goes through vertex X, only contains edges colored c and d and is maximal (we cannot add any other edge as it would include edges with a color not in {c, d}). Note that only one such path exists for a vertex X, as at most one edge of each color can be adjacent to a given vertex.\n\nGiven a fan \"F\"[1:\"k\"] of a vertex \"X\", the \"rotate fan\" operation does the following (in parallel):\n\nThis operation leaves the coloring valid, as for each \"i\", \"c\"(\"F\"[\"i\" + 1], \"X\") was free on (\"F\"[\"i\"], \"X\").\n\nThe operation \"invert the cd-path\" switches every edge on the path colored c to d and every edge colored d to c. Inverting a path can be useful to free a color on X if X is one of the endpoints of the path: if X was adjacent to color c but not d, it will now be adjacent to color d, not c, freeing c for another edge adjacent to X. The flipping operation will not alter the validity of the coloring since for the endpoints, only one of {c, d} can be adjacent to the vertex, and for other members of the path, the operation only switches the color of edges, no new color is added.\n\nInput: A graph G.\n\nOutput: A proper coloring c of the edges of G\n\nLet U := E(G)\n\nwhile U ≠ ∅ do\nend while\n\nThe correctness of the algorithm is proved in three parts. First, it is shown that the inversion of the cd path guarantees a vertex w such that \"w\" ∈ \"F\", \"F\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> = [\"F\"[1]...\"w\"] is a fan and \"d\" is free on \"w\". Then, it is shown that the edge coloring is proper and requires at most Δ + 1 colors.\n\nPrior to the inversion, there are two cases:\n\n\"F\"[\"x\"] can either be in the \"cd\" path or not. If it is not, then the inversion will not affect the set of free colors on \"F\"[\"x\"], and \"d\" will remain free on it. We can set \"w\" = \"F\"[\"x\"]. Otherwise, we can show that \"F\" is still a fan and \"d\" remains free on \"F\"[\"k\"]. Since \"d\" was free on \"F\"[\"x\"] before the inversion and \"F\"[\"x\"] is on the path, \"F\"[\"x\"] is an endpoint of the \"cd\" path and \"c\" will be free on \"F\"[\"x\"] after the inversion. The inversion will change the color of (\"u\", \"F\"[\"x\" + 1]) from \"d\" to \"c\". Thus, since \"c\" is now free on \"F\"[\"x\"] and (1) holds, \"F\" remains a fan. Also, \"d\" remains free on \"F\"[\"k\"], since \"F\"[\"k\"] is not on the \"cd\" path (suppose that it is; since \"d\" is free on \"F\"[\"k\"], then it would have to be an endpoint of the path, but \"u\" and \"F\"[\"x\"] are the endpoints). Select \"w\" = \"F\"[\"k\"].\n\nIn any case, the fan \"F\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> is a prefix of \"F\", which implies \"F\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> is also a fan.\n\nThis can be shown by induction on the number of colored edges. Base case: no edge is colored, this is valid. Induction step: suppose this was true at the end of the previous iteration. In the current iteration, after inverting the path, \"d\" will be free on \"u\", and by the previous result, it will also be free on \"w\". Rotating \"F\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> does not compromises the validity of the coloring. Thus, after setting \"c\"(\"u\",\"w\") = \"d\", the coloring is still valid.\n\nIn a given step, only colors \"c\" and \"d\" are used. Since \"u\" is adjacent to at least one uncolored edge and its degree is bounded by Δ, at least one color in {1...,Δ} is available for \"c\". For \"d\", \"F\"[\"k\"] may have degree Δ and no uncolored adjacent edge. Thus, a color Δ + 1 may be required.\n\nAt each step, the rotation uncolors the edge (u,w) while coloring edges (u,F[1]) and (u,v) which was previously uncolored. Thus, one additional edge gets colored. Hence, the loop will run formula_7 times. Finding the maximal fan, the colors c and d and invert the cd path can be done in formula_8 time. Finding w and rotating F' takes formula_9 time. Finding and removing the edge (u,v) can be done using a stack in constant time (pop the last element) and this stack can be populated in formula_7 time. Thus, each iteration of the loop takes formula_8 time, and the total running time is formula_12.\n"}

They include the length of coastlines, fully developed turbulence, real world scenes, the Sun’s magnetic field time series, heartbeat dynamics, human gait and activity, human brain acitivity, and natural luminosity time series. Models have been proposed in various contexts ranging from turbulence in fluid dynamics to internet traffic, finance, image modeling, texture synthesis, meteorology, geophysics and more. The origin of multifractality in sequential (time series) data has been attributed to mathematical convergence effects related to the central limit theorem that have as foci of convergence the family of statistical distributions known as the Tweedie exponential dispersion models as well as the geometric Tweedie models. The first convergence effect yields monofractal sequences and the second convergence effect is responsible for variation in the fractal dimension of the monofractal sequences.\n\nMultifractal analysis uses mathematical basis to investigate datasets, often in conjunction with other methods of fractal analysis and lacunarity analysis. The technique entails distorting datasets extracted from patterns to generate multifractal spectra that illustrate how scaling varies over the dataset. Multifractal analysis techniques have been applied in a variety of practical situations such as predicting earthquakes and interpreting medical images.\n\nIn a multifractal system formula_1, the behavior around any point is described by a local power law:\n\nThe exponent formula_3 is called the singularity exponent, as it describes the local degree of singularity or regularity around the point formula_4.\n\nThe ensemble formed by all the points that share the same singularity exponent is called the \"singularity manifold of exponent h\", and is a fractal set of fractal dimension formula_5: the singularity spectrum. The curve formula_5 versus h is called the \"singularity spectrum\" and fully describes the (statistical) distribution of the variable formula_1.\n\nIn practice, the multifractal behaviour of a physical system formula_8 is not directly characterized by its singularity spectrum formula_5. Data analysis rather gives access to the \"multiscaling exponents\" formula_10. Indeed, multifractal signals generally obey a \"scale invariance\" property which yields power law behaviours for multiresolution quantities depending on their scale formula_11. Depending on the object under study, these multiresolution quantities, denoted by formula_12 in the following, can be local averages in boxes of size formula_11, gradients over distance formula_11, wavelet coefficients at scale formula_11... For multifractal objects, one usually observes a global power law scaling of the form:\n\nat least in some range of scales and for some range of orders formula_17. When such a behaviour is observed, one talks of scale invariance, self-similarity or multiscaling.\n\nUsing the so-called \"multifractal formalism\", it can be shown that, under some well-suited assumptions, there exists a correspondence between the singularity spectrum formula_5 and the multiscaling exponents formula_19 through a Legendre transform. While the determination of formula_5 calls for some exhaustive local analysis of the data, which would result in difficult and numerically unstable calculations, the estimation of the formula_19 relies on the use of statistical averages and linear regressions in log-log diagrams. Once the formula_19 are known, one can deduce an estimate of formula_5 thanks to a simple Legendre transform.\n\nMultifractal systems are often modeled by stochastic processes such as multiplicative cascades. The formula_19 receives some statistical interpretation as they characterize the evolution of the distributions of the formula_12 as formula_11 goes from larger to smaller scales. This evolution is often called \"statistical intermittency\" and betrays a departure from Gaussian models.\n\nModelling as a multiplicative cascade also leads to estimation of multifractal properties (). This methods works reasonably well even for relatively small datasets A maximum likelihood fit of a multiplicative cascade to the dataset not only estimates the complete spectrum, but also gives reasonable estimates of the errors (see the web service ).\n\nMultifractal analysis has been used in several science fields to characterize various types of datasets. In essence, multifractal analysis applies a distorting factor to datasets extracted from patterns, to compare how the data behave at each distortion. This is done using graphs known as multifractal spectra, analogous to viewing the dataset through a \"distorting lens\" as shown in the illustration. Several types of multifractal spectra are used in practise.\n\nOne practical multifractal spectrum is the graph of D vs Q, where D is the generalized dimension for a dataset and Q is an arbitrary set of exponents. The expression \"generalized dimension\" thus refers to a set of dimensions for a dataset (detailed calculations for determining the generalized dimension using box counting are described below).\n\nThe general pattern of the graph of D vs Q can be used to assess the scaling in a pattern. The graph is generally decreasing, sigmoidal around Q=0, where D ≥ D ≥ D. As illustrated in the figure, variation in this graphical spectrum can help distinguish patterns. The image shows D spectra from a multifractal analysis of binary images of non-, mono-, and multi-fractal sets. As is the case in the sample images, non- and mono-fractals tend to have flatter D spectra than multifractals.\n\nThe generalized dimension also offers some important specific information. D is equal to the capacity dimension, which in the analysis shown in the figures here is the box counting dimension. D is equal to the information dimension, and D to the correlation dimension. This relates to the \"multi\" in multifractal whereby multifractals have multiple dimensions in the D vs Q spectra but monofractals stay rather flat in that area.\n\nAnother useful multifractal spectrum is the graph of formula_27 vs formula_28 (see calculations). These graphs generally rise to a maximum that approximates the fractal dimension at Q=0, and then fall. Like D vs Q spectra, they also show typical patterns useful for comparing non-, mono-, and multi-fractal patterns. In particular, for these spectra, non- and mono-fractals converge on certain values, whereas the spectra from multifractal patterns are typically humped over a broader extent.\n\nOne application of D vs q in ecology is the characterization of the abundance distribution of species. Traditionally the relative species abundances is calculated for an area without taking into account the positions of the individuals. An equivalent representation of relative species abundances are species ranks, used to generate a surface called the species-rank surface, which can be analyzed using generalized dimensions to detect different ecological mechanisms like the ones observed in neutral theory of biodiversity, metacommunity dynamics or niche theory.\n\nMultifractal spectra can be determined from box counting on digital images. First, a box counting scan is done to determine how the pixels are distributed; then, this \"mass distribution\" becomes the basis for a series of calculations. The chief idea is that for multifractals, the probability formula_31 of a number of pixels formula_32, appearing in a box formula_33, varies as box size formula_34, to some exponent formula_28, which changes over the image, as in . \"NB: For monofractals, in contrast, the exponent does not change meaningfully over the set.\" formula_31 is calculated from the box counting pixel distribution as in . \n\nformula_31 is used to observe how the pixel distribution behaves when distorted in certain ways as in and :\n\nThese distorting equations are further used to address how the set behaves when scaled or resolved or cut up into a series of formula_34-sized pieces and distorted by Q, to find different values for the dimension of the set, as in the following:\n\nThus, a series of values for formula_53 can be found from the slopes of the regression line for the log of versus the log of formula_34 for each formula_47, based on :\n\nIn practice, the probability distribution depends on how the dataset is sampled, so optimizing algorithms have been developed to ensure adequate sampling.\n\nMultifractal analysis has been successfully used in many fields including biology and physical sciences. For example, the quantification of residual crack patterns on the surface of reinforced concrete shear walls.\n\n\n"}

The most common operators are linear maps, which act on vector spaces. However, when using \"linear operator\" instead of \"linear map\", mathematicians often mean actions on vector spaces of functions, which also preserve other properties, such as continuity. For example, differentiation and indefinite integration are linear operators; operators that are built from them are called differential operators, integral operators or integro-differential operators.\n\nOperator is also used for denoting the symbol of a mathematical operation. This is related with the meaning of \"operator\" in computer programming, see operator (computer programming).\n\nThe most common kind of operator encountered are \"linear operators\". Let \"U\" and \"V\" be vector spaces over a field \"K\". A mapping \"A\": \"U\" → \"V\" is linear if\nfor all x, y in \"U\" and for all \"α, β\" in \"K\". \nThis means that a linear operator preserves vector space operations, in the sense that it does not matter whether you apply the linear operator before or after the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In more technical words, linear operators are morphisms between vector spaces.\n\nIn finite-dimensional case linear operators can be represented by matrices in the following way. Let formula_2 be a field, and formula_3 and formula_4 be finite-dimensional vector spaces over formula_2. Let us select a basis formula_6 in formula_3 and formula_8 in formula_4. Then let formula_10 be an arbitrary vector in formula_3 (assuming Einstein convention), and formula_12 be a linear operator. Then\nThen formula_14 is the matrix of the operator formula_15 in fixed bases. formula_16 does not depend on the choice of formula_17, and formula_18 iff formula_19. Thus in fixed bases n-by-m matrices are in bijective correspondence to linear operators from formula_3 to formula_4.\n\nThe important concepts directly related to operators between finite-dimensional vector spaces are the ones of rank, determinant, inverse operator, and eigenspace.\n\nLinear operators also play a great role in the infinite-dimensional case. The concepts of rank and determinant cannot be extended to infinite-dimensional matrices. This is why very different techniques are employed when studying linear operators (and operators in general) in the infinite-dimensional case. The study of linear operators in the infinite-dimensional case is known as functional analysis (so called because various classes of functions form interesting examples of infinite-dimensional vector spaces).\n\nThe space of sequences of real numbers, or more generally sequences of vectors in any vector space, themselves form an infinite-dimensional vector space. The most important cases are sequences of real or complex numbers, and these spaces, together with linear subspaces, are known as sequence spaces. Operators on these spaces are known as sequence transformations.\n\nBounded linear operators over Banach space form a Banach algebra in respect to the standard operator norm. The theory of Banach algebras develops a very general concept of spectra that elegantly generalizes the theory of eigenspaces.\n\nLet \"U\" and \"V\" be two vector spaces over the same ordered field (for example, formula_22), and they are equipped with norms. Then a linear operator from \"U\" to \"V\" is called bounded if there exists \"C > 0\" such that\nfor all x in \"U\".\n\nBounded operators form a vector space. On this vector space we can introduce a norm that is compatible with the norms of \"U\" and \"V\":\n\nIn case of operators from \"U\" to itself it can be shown that\n\nAny unital normed algebra with this property is called a Banach algebra. It is possible to generalize spectral theory to such algebras. C*-algebras, which are Banach algebras with some additional structure, play an important role in quantum mechanics.\n\nIn geometry, additional structures on vector spaces are sometimes studied. Operators that map such vector spaces to themselves bijectively are very useful in these studies, they naturally form groups by composition.\n\nFor example, bijective operators preserving the structure of a vector space are precisely the invertible linear operators. They form the general linear group under composition. They \"do not\" form a vector space under the addition of operators, e.g. both \"id\" and \"-id\" are invertible (bijective), but their sum, 0, is not.\n\nOperators preserving the Euclidean metric on such a space form the isometry group, and those that fix the origin form a subgroup known as the orthogonal group. Operators in the orthogonal group that also preserve the orientation of vector tuples form the special orthogonal group, or the group of rotations.\n\nOperators are also involved in probability theory, such as expectation, variance, and covariance.\n\nFrom the point of view of functional analysis, calculus is the study of two linear operators: the differential operator formula_26, and the indefinite integral operator formula_27.\n\nThe Fourier transform is useful in applied mathematics, particularly physics and signal processing. It is another integral operator; it is useful mainly because it converts a function on one (temporal) domain to a function on another (frequency) domain, in a way effectively invertible. No information is lost, as there is an inverse transform operator. In the simple case of periodic functions, this result is based on the theorem that any continuous periodic function can be represented as the sum of a series of sine waves and cosine waves:\nThe tuple \"(a, a, b, a, b, ...)\" is in fact an element of an infinite-dimensional vector space ℓ, and thus Fourier series is a linear operator.\n\nWhen dealing with general function R → C, the transform takes on an integral form:\n\nThe \"Laplace transform\" is another integral operator and is involved in simplifying the process of solving differential equations.\n\nGiven \"f\" = \"f\"(\"s\"), it is defined by:\n\nThree operators are key to vector calculus:\n\nAs an extension of vector calculus operators to physics, engineering and tensor spaces, Grad, Div and Curl operators also are often associated with Tensor calculus as well as vector calculus.\n\n"}

The optimal stopping problem is to find the stopping time formula_10 which maximizes the expected gain\nwhere formula_12 is called the value function. Here formula_13 can take value formula_14.\n\nA more specific formulation is as follows. We consider an adapted strong Markov process formula_15 defined on a filtered probability space formula_16 where formula_17 denotes the probability measure where the stochastic process starts at formula_18. Given continuous functions formula_19, and formula_20, the optimal stopping problem is \nThis is sometimes called the MLS (which stand for Mayer, Lagrange, and supremum, respectively) formulation.\n\nThere are generally two approaches of solving optimal stopping problems. When the underlying process (or the gain process) is described by its unconditional finite-dimensional distributions, the appropriate solution technique is the martingale approach, so called because it uses martingale theory, the most important concept being the Snell envelope. In the discrete time case, if the planning horizon formula_13 is finite, the problem can also be easily solved by dynamic programming.\n\nWhen the underlying process is determined by a family of (conditional) transition functions leading to a Markov family of transition probabilities, powerful analytical tools provided by the theory of Markov processes can often be utilized and this approach is referred to as the Markov method. The solution is usually obtained by solving the associated free-boundary problems (Stefan problems).\n\nLet formula_23 be a Lévy diffusion in formula_24 given by the SDE\nwhere formula_26 is an formula_27-dimensional Brownian motion, formula_28 is an formula_29-dimensional compensated Poisson random measure, formula_30, formula_31, and formula_32 are given functions such that a unique solution formula_33 exists. Let formula_34 be an open set (the solvency region) and \nbe the bankruptcy time. The optimal stopping problem is:\nIt turns out that under some regularity conditions, the following verification theorem holds:\n\nIf a function formula_37 satisfies\nthen formula_46 for all formula_47. Moreover, if\nThen formula_50 for all formula_47 and formula_52 is an optimal stopping time.\n\nThese conditions can also be written is a more compact form (the integro-variational inequality):\n\nYou have a fair coin and are repeatedly tossing it. Each time, before it is tossed, you can choose to stop tossing it and get paid (in dollars, say) the average number of heads observed.\n\nYou wish to maximise the amount you get paid by choosing a stopping rule.\nIf \"X\" (for \"i\" ≥ 1) forms a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables with Bernoulli distribution\nand if\nthen the sequences formula_58, and formula_59 are the objects associated with this problem.\n\nYou have a house and wish to sell it. Each day you are offered formula_61 for your house, and pay formula_62 to continue advertising it. If you sell your house on day formula_63, you will earn formula_64, where formula_65.\n\nYou wish to maximise the amount you earn by choosing a stopping rule.\n\nIn this example, the sequence (formula_66) is the sequence of offers for your house, and the sequence of reward functions is how much you will earn.\n\nYou are observing a sequence of objects which can be ranked from best to worst. You wish to choose a stopping rule which maximises your chance of picking the best object.\n\nHere, if formula_68 (\"n\" is some large number) are the ranks of the objects, and formula_6 is the chance you pick the best object if you stop intentionally rejecting objects at step i, then formula_70 and formula_71 are the sequences associated with this problem. This problem was solved in the early 1960s by several people. An elegant solution to the secretary problem and several modifications of this problem is provided by the more recent odds algorithm\nof optimal stopping (Bruss algorithm).\n\nEconomists have studied a number of optimal stopping problems similar to the 'secretary problem', and typically call this type of analysis 'search theory'. Search theory has especially focused on a worker's search for a high-wage job, or a consumer's search for a low-priced good.\n\nIn the trading of options on financial markets, the holder of an American option is allowed to exercise the right to buy (or sell) the underlying asset at a predetermined price at any time before or at the expiry date. Therefore, the valuation of American options is essentially an optimal stopping problem. Consider a classical Black-Scholes set-up and let formula_72 be the risk-free interest rate and formula_73 and formula_74 be the dividend rate and volatility of the stock. The stock price formula_75 follows geometric Brownian motion\nunder the risk-neutral measure. \n\nWhen the option is perpetual, the optimal stopping problem is\nwhere the payoff function is formula_78 for a call option and formula_79 for a put option. The variational inequality is\nfor all formula_81\nwhere formula_82 is the exercise boundary. The solution is known to be\n\nOn the other hand, when the expiry date is finite, the problem is associated with a 2-dimensional free-boundary problem with no known closed-form solution. Various numerical methods can however be used. See Black–Scholes model #American options for various valuation methods here, as well as Fugit for a discrete, tree based, calculation of the optimal time to exercise.\n\n\n\n"}

Called respectively right and left residuals, these operations coincide when the monoid is commutative. The general concept was introduced by Ward and Dilworth in 1939. Examples, some of which existed prior to the general concept, include Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras, residuated Boolean algebras, relation algebras, and MV-algebras. Residuated semilattices omit the meet operation ∧, for example Kleene algebras and action algebras.\n\nIn mathematics, a residuated lattice is an algebraic structure L = (\"L\", ≤, •, I) such that\n\nIn (iii), the \"greatest \"y\"\", being a function of \"z\" and \"x\", is denoted \"x\"\\\"z\" and called the right residual of \"z\" by \"x\". Think of it as what remains of \"z\" on the right after \"dividing\" \"z\" on the left by \"x\". Dually, the \"greatest \"x\"\" is denoted \"z\"/\"y\" and called the left residual of \"z\" by \"y\". An equivalent, more formal statement of (iii) that uses these operations to name these greatest values is\n\n(iii)' for all \"x\", \"y\", \"z\" in \"L\",   \"y\" ≤ \"x\"\\\"z\"   ⇔   \"x\"•\"y\" ≤ \"z\"   ⇔   \"x\" ≤ \"z\"/\"y\".\n\nAs suggested by the notation, the residuals are a form of quotient. More precisely, for a given \"x\" in \"L\", the unary operations \"x\"• and \"x\"\\ are respectively the lower and upper adjoints of a Galois connection on L, and dually for the two functions •\"y\" and /\"y\". By the same reasoning that applies to any Galois connection, we have yet another definition of the residuals, namely,\n\ntogether with the requirement that \"x\"•\"y\" be monotone in \"x\" and \"y\". (When axiomatized using (iii) or (iii)' monotonicity becomes a theorem and hence not required in the axiomatization.) These give a sense in which the functions \"x\"• and \"x\"\\ are pseudoinverses or adjoints of each other, and likewise for •\"x\" and /\"x\".\n\nThis last definition is purely in terms of inequalities, noting that monotonicity can be axiomatized as \"x\"•\"y\" ≤ (\"x\"∨\"z\")•\"y\" and similarly for the other operations and their arguments. Moreover, any inequality \"x\" ≤ \"y\" can be expressed equivalently as an equation, either \"x\"∧\"y\" = \"x\" or \"x\"∨\"y\" = \"y\". This along with the equations axiomatizing lattices and monoids then yields a purely equational definition of residuated lattices, provided the requisite operations are adjoined to the signature (\"L\", ≤, •, I) thereby expanding it to (\"L\", ∧, ∨, •, I, /, \\). When thus organized, residuated lattices form an equational class or variety, whose homomorphisms respect the residuals as well as the lattice and monoid operations. Note that distributivity \"x\"•(\"y\"∨\"z\") = (\"x\"•\"y\") ∨ (\"x\"•\"z\") and \"x\"•0 = 0 are consequences of these axioms and so do not need to be made part of the definition. This necessary distributivity of • over ∨ does not in general entail distributivity of ∧ over ∨, that is, a residuated lattice need not be a distributive lattice. However it does do so when • and ∧ are the same operation, a special case of residuated lattices called a Heyting algebra.\nAlternative notations for \"x\"•\"y\" include \"x\"◦\"y\", \"x\";\"y\" (relation algebra), and \"x\"⊗\"y\" (linear logic). Alternatives for I include \"e\" and 1'. Alternative notations for the residuals are \"x\" → \"y\" for \"x\"\\\"y\" and \"y\" ← \"x\" for \"y\"/\"x\", suggested by the similarity between residuation and implication in logic, with the multiplication of the monoid understood as a form of conjunction that need not be commutative. When the monoid is commutative the two residuals coincide. When not commutative, the intuitive meaning of the monoid as conjunction and the residuals as implications can be understood as having a temporal quality: \"x\"•\"y\" means \"x\" \"and then\" \"y\",   \"x\" → \"y\" means \"had\" \"x\" (in the past) \"then\" \"y\" (now),   and \"y\" ← \"x\" means \"if-ever\" \"x\" (in the future) \"then\" \"y\" (at that time), as illustrated by the natural language example at the end of the examples.\n\nOne of the original motivations for the study of residuated lattices was the lattice of (two-sided) ideals of a ring. Given a ring \"R\", the ideals of \"R\", denoted Id(\"R\"), forms a complete lattice with set intersection acting as the meet operation and \"ideal addition\" acting as the join operation. The monoid operation • is given by \"ideal multiplication\", and the element \"R\" of Id(\"R\") acts as the identity for this operation. Given two ideals \"A\" and \"B\" in Id(\"R\"), the residuals are given by\nIt is worth noting that {0}/\"B\" and \"B\"\\{0} are respectively the left and right annihilators of \"B\". This residuation is related to the \"conductor\" (or \"transporter\") in commutative algebra written as (\"A\":\"B\")=\"A\"/\"B\". One difference in usage is that \"B\" need not be an ideal of \"R\": it may just be a subset.\n\nBoolean algebras and Heyting algebras are commutative residuated lattices in which \"x\"•\"y\" = \"x\"∧\"y\" (whence the unit I is the top element 1 of the algebra) and both residuals \"x\"\\\"y\" and \"y\"/\"x\" are the same operation, namely implication \"x\" → \"y\". The second example is quite general since Heyting algebras include all finite distributive lattices, as well as all chains or total orders forming a complete lattice, for example the unit interval [0,1] in the real line, or the integers and ±formula_3.\n\nThe structure (Z, \"min\", \"max\", +, 0, −, −) (the integers with subtraction for both residuals) is a commutative residuated lattice such that the unit of the monoid is not the greatest element (indeed there is no least or greatest integer), and the multiplication of the monoid is not the meet operation of the lattice. In this example the inequalities are equalities because − (subtraction) is not merely the adjoint or pseudoinverse of + but the true inverse. Any totally ordered group under addition such as the rationals or the reals can be substituted for the integers in this example. The nonnegative portion of any of these examples is an example provided \"min\" and \"max\" are interchanged and − is replaced by monus, defined (in this case) so that \"x\"-\"y\" = 0 when \"x\" ≤ \"y\" and otherwise is ordinary subtraction.\n\nA more general class of examples is given by the Boolean algebra of all binary relations on a set \"X\", namely the power set of \"X\", made a residuated lattice by taking the monoid multiplication • to be composition of relations and the monoid unit to be the identity relation I on \"X\" consisting of all pairs (\"x\",\"x\") for \"x\" in \"X\". Given two relations \"R\" and \"S\" on \"X\", the right residual \"R\"\\\"S\" of \"S\" by \"R\" is the binary relation such that \"x\"(\"R\"\\\"S\")\"y\" holds just when for all \"z\" in \"X\", \"zRx\" implies \"zSy\" (notice the connection with implication). The left residual is the mirror image of this: \"y\"(\"S\"/\"R\")\"x\" holds just when for all \"z\" in \"X\", \"xRz\" implies \"ySz\".\n\nThis can be illustrated with the binary relations < and > on {0,1} in which 0 < 1 and 1 > 0 are the only relationships that hold. Then \"x\"(>\\<)\"y\" holds just when \"x\" = 1, while \"x\"(</>)\"y\" holds just when \"y\" = 0, showing that residuation of < by > is different depending on whether we residuate on the right or the left. This difference is a consequence of the difference between <•> and >•<, where the only relationships that hold are 0(<•>)0 (since 0<1>0) and 1(>•<)1 (since 1>0<1). Had we chosen ≤ and ≥ instead of < and >, ≥\\≤ and ≤/≥ would have been the same because ≤•≥ = ≥•≤, both of which always hold between all \"x\" and \"y\" (since \"x\"≤1≥\"y\" and \"x\"≥0≤\"y\").\n\nThe Boolean algebra 2 of all formal languages over an alphabet (set) Σ forms a residuated lattice whose monoid multiplication is language concatenation \"LM\" and whose monoid unit I is the language {ε} consisting of just the empty string ε. The right residual \"M\"\\\"L\" consists of all words \"w\" over Σ such that \"Mw\" ⊆ \"L\". The left residual \"L\"/\"M\" is the same with \"wM\" in place of \"Mw\".\n\nThe residuated lattice of all binary relations on \"X\" is finite just when \"X\" is finite, and commutative just when \"X\" has at most one element. When \"X\" is empty the algebra is the degenerate Boolean algebra in which 0 = 1 = I. The residuated lattice of all languages on Σ is commutative just when Σ has at most one letter. It is finite just when Σ is empty, consisting of the two languages 0 (the empty language {}) and the monoid unit I = {ε} = 1.\n\nThe examples forming a Boolean algebra have special properties treated in the article on residuated Boolean algebras.\n\nIn natural language residuated lattices formalize the logic of \"and\" when used with its noncommutative meaning of \"and then.\" Setting \"x\" = \"bet\", \"y\" = \"win\", \"z\" = \"rich\", we can read \"x\"•\"y\" ≤ \"z\" as \"bet and then win entails rich.\" By the axioms this is equivalent to \"y\" ≤ \"x\"→\"z\" meaning \"win entails had bet then rich\", and also to \"x\" ≤ \"z\"←\"y\" meaning \"bet entails if-ever win then rich.\" Humans readily detect such non-sequiturs as \"bet entails had win then rich\" and \"win entails if-ever bet then rich\" as both being equivalent to the wishful thinking \"win and then bet entails rich.\" Humans do not so readily detect that Peirce's law ((\"P\"→\"Q\")→\"P\")→\"P\" is a tautology, an interesting situation where humans exhibit more proficiency with nonclassical reasoning than classical.\n\nA residuated semilattice is defined almost identically for residuated lattices, omitting just the meet operation ∧. Thus it is an algebraic structure L = (L, ∨, •, 1, /, \\) satisfying all the residuated lattice equations as specified above except those containing an occurrence of the symbol ∧. The option of defining \"x\" ≤ \"y\" as \"x\"∧\"y\" = \"x\" is then not available, leaving only the other option \"x\"∨\"y\" = \"y\" (or any equivalent thereof).\n\nAny residuated lattice can be made a residuated semilattice simply by omitting ∧. Residuated semilattices arise in connection with action algebras, which are residuated semilattices that are also Kleene algebras, for which ∧ is ordinarily not required.\n\n\n"}

In such models key quantities of interest are the probability of ruin, distribution of surplus immediately prior to ruin and deficit at time of ruin.\n\nThe theoretical foundation of ruin theory, known as the Cramér–Lundberg model (or classical compound-Poisson risk model, classical risk process or Poisson risk process) was introduced in 1903 by the Swedish actuary Filip Lundberg. Lundberg's work was republished in the 1930s by Harald Cramér.\n\nThe model describes an insurance company who experiences two opposing cash flows: incoming cash premiums and outgoing claims. Premiums arrive a constant rate \"c\" > 0 from customers and claims arrive according to a Poisson process with intensity \"λ\" and are independent and identically distributed non-negative random variables with distribution \"F\" and mean \"μ\" (they form a compound Poisson process). So for an insurer who starts with initial surplus \"x\",\nThe central object of the model is to investigate the probability that the insurer's surplus level eventually falls below zero (making the firm bankrupt). This quantity, called the probability of ultimate ruin, is defined as\nwhere the time of ruin is formula_3 with the convention that formula_4. This can be computed exactly using the Pollaczek–Khinchine formula as (the ruin function here is equivalent to the tail function of the stationary distribution of waiting time in an M/G/1 queue)\nwhere formula_6 is the transform of the tail distribution of \"F\",\nIn the case where the claim sizes are exponentially distributed, this simplifies to\n\nE. Sparre Andersen extended the classical model in 1957 by allowing claim inter-arrival times to have arbitrary distribution functions.\nwhere the claim number process formula_10 is a renewal process and formula_11 are independent and identically distributed random variables. \nThe model furthermore assumes that formula_12 almost surely and that formula_10 and formula_11 are independent . The model is also known as the renewal risk model.\n\nMichael R. Powers and Gerber and Shiu analyzed the behavior of the insurer's surplus through the expected discounted penalty function, which is commonly referred to as Gerber-Shiu function in the ruin literature. It is arguable whether the function should have been called Powers-Gerber-Shiu function due to the contribution of Powers.\n\nIn Powers’ notation, this is defined as\n\nwhere formula_16 is the discounting force of interest, formula_17 is a general penalty function reflecting the economic costs to the insurer at the time of ruin, and the expectation formula_18 corresponds to the probability measure formula_19. The function is called expected discounted cost of insolvency in Powers.\n\nIn Gerber and Shiu’s notation, it is given as\n\nwhere formula_16 is the discounting force of interest and formula_22 is a penalty function capturing the economic costs to the insurer at the time of ruin (assumed to depend on the surplus prior to ruin formula_23 and the deficit at ruin formula_24), and the expectation formula_18 corresponds to the probability measure formula_19. Here the indicator function formula_27 emphasizes that the penalty is exercised only when ruin occurs.\n\nIt is quite intuitive to interpret the expected discounted penalty function. Since the function measures the actuarial present value of the penalty that occurs at formula_28, the penalty function is multiplied by the discounting factor formula_29, and then averaged over the probability distribution of the waiting time to formula_28. While Gerber and Shiu applied this function to the classical compound-Poisson model, Powers argued that an insurer’s surplus is better modeled by a family of diffusion processes.\n\nThere are a great variety of ruin-related quantities that fall into the category of the expected discounted penalty function.\nOther finance-related quantities belonging to the class of the expected discounted penalty function include the perpetual American put option, the contingent claim at optimal exercise time, and more.\n\n\n\n"}

If \"K\" is a perfect field then the two concepts coincide. In general, \"P\"(\"X\") is separable if and only if it is square-free over any field that contains \"K\",\nwhich holds if and only if \"P\"(\"X\") is coprime to its formal derivative \"D P\"(\"X\").\n\nIn an older definition, \"P\"(\"X\") was considered separable if each of its irreducible factors in K[X] is separable in the modern definition. In this definition, separability depended on the field \"K\", for example, any polynomial over a perfect field would have been considered separable. This definition, although it can be convenient for Galois theory, is no longer in use.\n\nSeparable polynomials are used to define separable extensions: A field extension is a separable extension if and only if for every , which is algebraic over , the minimal polynomial of over is a separable polynomial.\n\nInseparable extensions (that is extensions which are not separable) may occur only in characteristic. \n\nThe criterion above leads to the quick conclusion that if \"P\" is irreducible and not separable, then \"D P\"(\"X\")=0.\nThus we must have\nfor some polynomial \"Q\" over \"K\", where the prime number \"p\" is the characteristic.\n\nWith this clue we can construct an example:\nwith \"K\" the field of rational functions in the indeterminate \"T\" over the finite field with \"p\" elements. Here one can prove directly that \"P\"(\"X\") is irreducible, and not separable. This is actually a typical example of why \"inseparability\" matters; in geometric terms \"P\" represents the mapping on the projective line over the finite field, taking co-ordinates to their \"p\"th power. Such mappings are fundamental to the algebraic geometry of finite fields. Put another way, there are coverings in that setting that cannot be 'seen' by Galois theory. (See radical morphism for a higher-level discussion.)\n\nIf \"L\" is the field extension \n\nin other words the splitting field of \"P\", then \"L\"/\"K\" is an example of a purely inseparable field extension. It is of degree \"p\", but has no automorphism fixing \"K\", other than the identity, because \"T\" is the unique root of \"P\". This shows directly that Galois theory must here break down. A field such that there are no such extensions is called \"perfect\". That finite fields are perfect follows \"a posteriori\" from their known structure.\n\nOne can show that the tensor product of fields of \"L\" with itself over \"K\" for this example has nilpotent elements that are non-zero. This is another manifestation of inseparability: that is, the tensor product operation on fields need not produce a ring that is a product of fields (so, not a commutative semisimple ring).\n\nIf \"P\"(\"x\") is separable, and its roots form a group (a subgroup of the field \"K\"), then \"P\"(\"x\") is an additive polynomial.\n\nSeparable polynomials occur frequently in Galois theory.\n\nFor example, let \"P\" be an irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients and \"p\" be a prime number which does not divide the leading coefficient of \"P\". Let \"Q\" be the polynomial over the finite field with \"p\" elements, which is obtained by reducing modulo \"p\" the coefficients of \"P\". Then, if \"Q\" is separable (which is the case for every \"p\" but a finite number) then the degrees of the irreducible factors of \"Q\" are the lengths of the cycles of some permutation of the Galois group of \"P\". \n\nAnother example: \"P\" being as above, a resolvent \"R\" for a group \"G\" is a polynomial whose coefficients are polynomials in the coefficients of \"P\", which provides some information on the Galois group of \"P\". More precisely, if \"R\" is separable and has a rational root then the Galois group of \"P\" is contained in \"G\". For example, if \"D\" is the discriminant of \"P\" then formula_1 is a resolvent for the alternating group. This resolvent is always separable (assuming the characteristic is not 2) if \"P\" is irreducible, but most resolvents are not always separable.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28212", "title": "Skewness", "text": "Skewness\n\nIn probability theory and statistics, skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or undefined.\n\nFor a unimodal distribution, negative skew commonly indicates that the \"tail\" is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right. In cases where one tail is long but the other tail is fat, skewness does not obey a simple rule. For example, a zero value means that the tails on both sides of the mean balance out overall; this is the case for a symmetric distribution, but can also be true for an asymmetric distribution where one tail is long and thin, and the other is short but fat. \n\nSome popular intuitions about skewness are not correct. As a 2005 journal article points out:\n\nMany textbooks teach a rule of thumb stating that the mean is right of the median under right skew, and left of the median under left skew. This rule fails with surprising frequency. It can fail in multimodal distributions, or in distributions where one tail is long but the other is heavy. Most commonly, though, the rule fails in discrete distributions where the areas to the left and right of the median are not equal.\nConsider the two distributions in the figure just below. Within each graph, the values on the right side of the distribution taper differently from the values on the left side. These tapering sides are called \"tails\", and they provide a visual means to determine which of the two kinds of skewness a distribution has:\n\n\nSkewness in a data series may sometimes be observed not only graphically but by simple inspection of the values. For instance, consider the numeric sequence (49, 50, 51), whose values are evenly distributed around a central value of 50. We can transform this sequence into a negatively skewed distribution by adding a value far below the mean, e.g. (40, 49, 50, 51). Similarly, we can make the sequence positively skewed by adding a value far above the mean, e.g. (49, 50, 51, 60).\n\nThe skewness is not directly related to the relationship between the mean and median: a distribution with negative skew can have its mean greater than or less than the median, and likewise for positive skew.\n\nIn the older notion of nonparametric skew, defined as formula_1 where formula_2 is the mean, formula_3 is the median, and formula_4 is the standard deviation, the skewness is defined in terms of this relationship: positive/right nonparametric skew means the mean is greater than (to the right of) the median, while negative/left nonparametric skew means the mean is less than (to the left of) the median. However, the modern definition of skewness and the traditional nonparametric definition do not in general have the same sign: while they agree for some families of distributions, they differ in general, and conflating them is misleading.\n\nIf the distribution is symmetric, then the mean is equal to the median, and the distribution has zero skewness. If the distribution is both symmetric and unimodal, then the mean = median = mode. This is the case of a coin toss or the series 1,2,3,4... Note, however, that the converse is not true in general, i.e. zero skewness does not imply that the mean is equal to the median.\n\nA 2005 journal article points out:\n\nMany textbooks, teach a rule of thumb stating that the mean is right of the median under right skew, and left of the median under left skew. This rule fails with surprising frequency. It can fail in multimodal distributions, or in distributions where one tail is long but the other is heavy. Most commonly, though, the rule fails in discrete distributions where the areas to the left and right of the median are not equal. Such distributions not only contradict the textbook relationship between mean, median, and skew, they also contradict the textbook interpretation of the median.\n\nThe skewness of a random variable \"X\" is the third standardized moment \"γ\", defined as:\nwhere \"μ\" is the mean, \"σ\" is the standard deviation, E is the expectation operator, \"μ\" is the third central moment, and \"κ\" are the t cumulants. It is sometimes referred to as Pearson's moment coefficient of skewness, or simply the moment coefficient of skewness, but should not be confused with Pearson's other skewness statistics (see below). The last equality expresses skewness in terms of the ratio of the third cumulant \"κ\" to the 1.5th power of the second cumulant \"κ\". This is analogous to the definition of kurtosis as the fourth cumulant normalized by the square of the second cumulant. \nThe skewness is also sometimes denoted Skew[\"X\"].\n\nSkewness can be expressed in terms of the non-central moment E[\"X\"] by expanding the previous formula,\nSkewness can be infinite, as when\nwhere the third cumulants are infinite, or as when\nwhere the third cumulant is undefined.\n\nStarting from a standard cumulant expansion around a normal distribution, one can show that\n\nIf \"Y\" is the sum of \"n\" independent and identically distributed random variables, all with the distribution of \"X\", then the third cumulant of \"Y\" is \"n\" times that of \"X\" and the second cumulant of \"Y\" is \"n\" times that of \"X\", so formula_9. This shows that the skewness of the sum is smaller, as it approaches a Gaussian distribution in accordance with the central limit theorem. Note that the assumption that the variables be independent for the above formula is very important because it is possible even for the sum of two Gaussian variables to have a skewed distribution (see this example).\n\nFor a sample of \"n\" values, a natural method of moments estimator of the population skewness is\n\nwhere formula_11 is the sample mean, \"s\" is the sample standard deviation, and the numerator \"m\" is the sample third central moment.\n\nAnother common definition of the \"sample skewness\" is\n\nformula_12\n\nwhere formula_13 is the unique symmetric unbiased estimator of the third cumulant and formula_14 is the symmetric unbiased estimator of the second cumulant (i.e. the variance).\n\nIn general, the ratios formula_15 and formula_16 are both biased estimators of the population skewness formula_17; their expected values can even have the opposite sign from the true skewness. (For instance, a mixed distribution consisting of very thin Gaussians centred at −99, 0.5, and 2 with weights 0.01, 0.66, and 0.33 has a skewness of about −9.77, but in a sample of 3, formula_16 has an expected value of about 0.32, since usually all three samples are in the positive-valued part of the distribution, which is skewed the other way.) Nevertheless, formula_15 and formula_16 each have obviously the correct expected value of zero for any symmetric distribution with a finite third moment, including a normal distribution.\n\nUnder the assumption that the underlying random variable formula_21 is normally distributed, it can be shown that formula_22. The variance of the skewness of a random sample of size \"n\" from a normal distribution is\n\nAn approximate alternative is 6/\"n\", but this is inaccurate for small samples.\n\nIn normal samples, formula_15 has the smaller variance of the two estimators, with\n\nwhere \"m\" in the denominator is the (biased) sample second central moment.\n\nThe adjusted Fisher–Pearson standardized moment coefficient formula_26 is the version found in Excel and several statistical packages including Minitab, SAS and SPSS.\n\nSkewness is a descriptive statistic that can be used on conjunction with the histogram and the normal quantile plot to characterize the data or distribution.\n\nSkewness indicates which direction and a relative magnitude of how far a distribution deviates from normal. \n\nWith pronounced skewness, standard statistical inference procedures such as a confidence interval for a mean will be not only incorrect, in the sense of having true coverage level unequal to the nominal (e.g., 95%) level, but also with unequal error probabilities on each side.\n\nSkewness can be used to obtain approximate probabilities and quantiles of distributions (such as the value at risk in finance) via the Cornish-Fisher expansion. \n\nMany models assume normal distribution; i.e., data are symmetric about the mean. The normal distribution has a skewness of zero. But in reality, data points may not be perfectly symmetric. So, an understanding of the skewness of the dataset indicates whether deviations from the mean are going to be positive or negative.\n\nD'Agostino's K-squared test is a goodness-of-fit normality test based on sample skewness and sample kurtosis.\n\nOther measures of skewness have been used, including simpler calculations suggested by Karl Pearson (not to be confused with Pearson's moment coefficient of skewness, see above). These other measures are:\n\nThe Pearson mode skewness, or first skewness coefficient, is defined as\n\nThe Pearson median skewness, or second skewness coefficient, is defined as\n\nThe latter is a simple multiple of the nonparametric skew.\n\nBowley's measure of skewness (from 1901), also called Yule's coefficient (from 1912) is defined as: \nWhen writing it as formula_28, it is easier to see that the numerator is the average of the upper and lower quartiles (a measure of location) minus the median while the denominator is (Q3-Q1)/2 which (for symmetric distributions) is the MAD measure of dispersion.\n\nOther names for this measure are Galton's measure of skewness, the Yule–Kendall index and the quartile skewness ,\n\nA more general formulation of a skewness function was described by Groeneveld, R. A. and Meeden, G. (1984):\nwhere \"F\" is the cumulative distribution function. This leads to a corresponding overall measure of skewness defined as the supremum of this over the range 1/2 ≤ \"u\" < 1. Another measure can be obtained by integrating the numerator and denominator of this expression. The function \"γ\"(\"u\") satisfies −1 ≤ \"γ\"(\"u\") ≤ 1 and is well defined without requiring the existence of any moments of the distribution.\n\nBowley's measure of skewness is γ(\"u\") evaluated at \"u\" = 3/4. Kelley's measure of skewness uses \"u\" = 0.1.\n\nGroeneveld & Meeden have suggested, as an alternative measure of skewness,\n\nwhere \"μ\" is the mean, \"ν\" is the median, |…| is the absolute value, and \"E\"() is the expectation operator. This is closely related in form to Pearson's second skewness coefficient.\n\nUse of L-moments in place of moments provides a measure of skewness known as the L-skewness.\n\nA value of skewness equal to zero does not imply that the probability distribution is symmetric. Thus there is a need for another measure of asymmetry that has this property: such a measure was introduced in 2000. It is called distance skewness and denoted by dSkew. If \"X\" is a random variable taking values in the \"d\"-dimensional Euclidean space, \"X\" has finite expectation, \"X\" is an independent identically distributed copy of \"X\", and formula_31 denotes the norm in the Euclidean space, then a simple \"measure of asymmetry\" with respect to location parameter θ is\nand dSkew(\"X\") := 0 for \"X\" = θ (with probability 1). Distance skewness is always between 0 and 1, equals 0 if and only if \"X\" is diagonally symmetric with respect to θ (\"X\" and θ −\"X\" have the same probability distribution) and equals 1 if and only if X is a constant \"c\" (formula_33) with probability one. Thus there is a simple consistent statistical test of diagonal symmetry based on the sample distance skewness:\n\nThe medcouple is a scale-invariant robust measure of skewness, with a breakdown point of 25%. It is the median of the values of the kernel function\ntaken over all couples formula_36 such that formula_37, where formula_38 is the median of the sample formula_39. It can be seen as the median of all possible quantile skewness measures.\n\n\nAdjusting the Tests for Skewness and Kurtosis for Distributional Misspecifications.

{"id": "10159567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10159567", "title": "Spiking neural network", "text": "Spiking neural network\n\nSpiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural network models that more closely mimic natural neural networks. In addition to neuronal and synaptic state, SNNs also incorporate the concept of time into their operating model. The idea is that neurons in the SNN do not fire at each propagation cycle (as it happens with typical multi-layer perceptron networks), but rather fire only when a membrane potential – an intrinsic quality of the neuron related to its membrane electrical charge – reaches a specific value. When a neuron fires, it generates a signal which travels to other neurons which, in turn, increase or decrease their potentials in accordance with this signal.\n\nIn the context of spiking neural networks, the current activation level (modeled as some differential equation) is normally considered to be the neuron's state, with incoming spikes pushing this value higher, and then either firing or decaying over time. Various \"coding methods\" exist for interpreting the outgoing \"spike train\" as a real-value number, either relying on the frequency of spikes, or the timing between spikes, to encode information.\n\nThe first scientific model of a spiking neuron was proposed by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in 1952. This model describes how action potentials are initiated and propagated. Spikes, however, are not generally transmitted directly between neurons. Communication requires the exchange of chemical substances in the synaptic gap, called neurotransmitters. The complexity and variability of biological models have resulted in various neuron models, such as the integrate-and-fire (1907?), FitzHugh–Nagumo model (1961–1962) and Hindmarsh–Rose model (1984).\n\nFrom the information theory point of view, the problem is to propose a model that explains how information is encoded and decoded by a series of trains of pulses, i.e. action potentials. Thus, one of the fundamental questions of neuroscience is to determine if neurons communicate by a rate or temporal code. Temporal coding suggests that a single spiking neuron \"can replace hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net.\"\n\nThis kind of neural network can in principle be used for information processing applications the same way as traditional artificial neural networks. In addition, spiking neural networks can model the central nervous system of a virtual insect for seeking food without the prior knowledge of the environment. However, due to their more realistic properties, they can also be used to study the operation of biological neural circuits. Starting with a hypothesis about the topology of a biological neuronal circuit and its function, the electrophysiological recordings of this circuit can be compared to the output of the corresponding spiking artificial neural network simulated on computer, determining the plausibility of the starting hypothesis.\n\nIn practice, there is a major difference between the theoretical power of spiking neural networks and what has been demonstrated. They have proved useful in neuroscience, but not (yet) in engineering. Some large scale neural network models have been designed that take advantage of the pulse coding found in spiking neural networks, these networks mostly rely on the principles of reservoir computing. However, the real world application of large scale spiking neural networks has been limited because the increased computational costs associated with simulating realistic neural models have not been justified by commensurate benefits in computational power. As a result, there has been little application of large scale spiking neural networks to solve computational tasks of the order and complexity that are commonly addressed using rate coded (second generation) neural networks. In addition it can be difficult to adapt second generation neural network models into real time, spiking neural networks (especially if these network algorithms are defined in discrete time). It is relatively easy to construct a spiking neural network model and observe its dynamics. It is much harder to develop a model with stable behavior that computes a specific function.\n\nThere is diverse range of application software to simulate spiking neural networks. This software can be classified according to the use of the simulation:\n\nNeurogrid, built at Stanford University, is a board that can simulate spiking neural networks directly in hardware. SpiNNaker (Spiking Neural Network Architecture), designed at the University of Manchester, uses ARM processors as the building blocks of a massively parallel computing platform based on a six-layer thalamocortical model.\n\nAnother implementation is the TrueNorth processor from IBM. This processor contains 5.4 billion transistors, but is designed to consume very little power, only 70 milliwatts; most processors in personal computers contain about 1.4 billion transistors and require 35 watts or more. IBM refers to the design principle behind TrueNorth as neuromorphic computing. Its primary purpose is pattern recognition; while critics say the chip isn't powerful enough, its supporters point out that this is only the first generation, and the capabilities of improved iterations will become clear.\n\nThe first commercial implementation of a hardware-accelerated spiking neural network system, was introduced by BrainChip in September 2017. BrainChip Accelerator is an 8-lane, PCI-Express add-in card that increases the speed and accuracy of the object recognition function of BrainChip Studio software (see above) by up to six times. The processing is done by six BrainChip Accelerator cores in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Each core performs fast, user-defined image scaling, spike generation, and spiking neural network comparison to recognize objects. In combination with a CPU , BrainChip Accelerator can process 16 channels of video simultaneously, with an effective throughput of over 600 frames per second. The low-power characteristics of BrainChip’s spiking neural technology results in only 15 watts total consumption. It's particularly suited to aiding law enforcement and intelligence organizations to rapidly search vast amounts of video footage and identify patterns or faces. The SNN technology enables the Hardware Accelerator to work on low-resolution video and requires only a 24x24 pixel image to detect and classify faces.\n\nAnother hardware platform aimed at providing reconfigurable, general-purpose, real-time neural networks of spiking neurons is the Dynamic Neuromorphic Asynchronous Processor (DYNAP). DYNAP uses a unique combination of slow, low-power, inhomogeneous sub-thresholds analog circuits, and fast programmable digital circuits. This allow the implementation of real-time spike-based neural processing architectures in which memory and computation are co-localized, solving the von Neumann bottleneck problem and enabling real-time massively multiplexed communication of spiking events for realising massive networks. Recurrent networks, feed-forward networks, convolutional networks, attractor networks, echo-state networks, deep networks, and sensory fusion networks are few of the possibilities.\n\n\n"}

This is equivalent to saying that a unital is a 2-(\"n\" + 1, \"n\" + 1, 1) block design. Some unitals may be embedded in a projective plane of order \"n\" (the subsets of the design become sets of collinear points in the projective plane). In this case of \"embedded unitals\", every line of the plane intersects the unital in either 1 or \"n\" + 1 points. In the Desarguesian planes, PG(2,\"q\"), the classical examples of unitals are given by nondegenerate Hermitian curves. There are also many non-classical examples. The first and the only known unital with non prime power parameters, \"n\"=\"6\", was constructed by Bhaskar Bagchi and Sunanda Bagchi. It is still unknown if this unital can be embedded in a projective plane of order \"36\", if such a plane exists.\n\nWe review some terminology used in projective geometry.\n\nA correlation of a projective geometry is a bijection on its subspaces that reverses containment. In particular, a correlation interchanges points and hyperplanes.\n\nA correlation of order two is called a polarity.\n\nA polarity is called a unitary polarity if its associated sesquilinear form \"s\" with companion automorphism \"α\" satisfies:\n\nA point is called an absolute point of a polarity if it lies on the image of itself under the polarity.\n\nThe absolute points of a unitary polarity of the projective geometry PG(\"d\",\"F\"), for some \"d\" ≥ 2, is a nondegenerate Hermitian variety, and if \"d\" = 2 this variety is called a nondegenerate Hermitian curve.\n\nIn PG(2,\"q\") for some prime power \"q\", the set of points of a nondegenerate Hermitian curve form a unital, which is called a \"classical unital\".\n\nLet formula_1 be a nondegenerate Hermitian curve in formula_2 for some prime power formula_3. As all nondgenerate Hermitian curves in the same plane are projectively equivalent, formula_4 can be described in terms of homogeneous coordinates as follows:\n\nAnother family of unitals, based on Ree groups was constructed by H. Lüneburg. Let Γ = R(\"q\") be the Ree group of type G of order (\"q\" + 1)\"q\"(\"q\" − 1) where \"q\" = 3. Let \"P\" be the set of all \"q\" + 1 Sylow 3-subgroups of Γ. Γ acts doubly transitively on this set by conjugation (it will be convenient to think of these subgroups as \"points\" that Γ is acting on.) For any \"S\" and \"T\" in \"P\", the pointwise stabilizer, Γ is cyclic of order \"q\" - 1, and thus contains a unique involution, μ. Each such involution fixes exactly \"q\" + 1 points of \"P\". Construct a block design on the points of \"P\" whose blocks are the fixed point sets of these various involutions μ. Since Γ acts doubly transitively on \"P\", this will be a 2-design with parameters 2-(\"q\" + 1, \"q\" + 1, 1) called a Ree unital.\n\nLüneburg also showed that the Ree unitals can not be embedded in projective planes of order \"q\" (Desarguesian or not) such that the automorphism group Γ is induced by a collineation group of the plane. For \"q\" = 3, Grüning proved that a Ree unital can not be embedded in any projective plane of order 9.\n\nSince unitals are block designs, two unitals are said to be \"isomorphic\" if there is a design isomorphism between them, that is, a bijection between the point sets which maps blocks to blocks. This concept does not take into account the property of embeddability, so to do so we say that two unitals, embedded in the same ambient plane, are \"equivalent\" if there is a collineation of the plane which maps one unital to the other.\n\nThere are precisely four projective planes of order 9: the Desarguesian plane PG(2,9), the Hall plane of order 9, the dual Hall plane of order 9 and the Hughes plane of order 9. An exhaustive computer search by Penttila and Royle found 18 unitals (up to equivalence) with \"n\" = 3 in these four planes. Two in PG(2,9), four in the Hall plane, and so another four in the dual Hall plane, and eight in the Hughes plane. However, one of the unitals in the Hall plane is self-dual, and so, gets counted again in the dual Hall plane. Thus, there are 17 distinct embeddable unitals with \"n\" = 3. On the other hand, a nonexhaustive computer search found over 900 mutually nonisomorphic designs which are unitals with \"n\" = 3.\n\n"}
