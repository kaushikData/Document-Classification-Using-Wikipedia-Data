{"id": "21409717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21409717", "title": "Abelian sandpile model", "text": "Abelian sandpile model\n\nThe Abelian sandpile model, also known as the Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld model, was the first discovered example of a dynamical system displaying self-organized criticality. It was introduced by Per Bak, Chao Tang and Kurt Wiesenfeld in a 1987 paper.\n\nThe model is a cellular automaton. In its original formulation, each site on a finite grid has an associated value that corresponds to the slope of the pile. This slope builds up as \"grains of sand\" (or \"chips\") are randomly placed onto the pile, until the slope exceeds a specific threshold value at which time that site collapses transferring sand into the adjacent sites, increasing their slope. Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld considered process of successive random placement of sand grains on the grid; each such placement of sand at a particular site may have no effect, or it may cause a cascading reaction that will affect many sites.\n\nThe model has since been studied on the infinite lattice, on other (non-square) lattices, and on arbitrary graphs (including directed multigraphs).\n\nThe iteration rules for the model on the square lattice can be defined as follows:\n\nBegin with some nonnegative configuration formula_1 which is finite, in the sense that\n\nAny site formula_3 with\nis \"unstable\" and can \"topple\", sending one of its chips to each of its four neighbors:\n\nThe process is guaranteed to terminate given that the initial configuration was finite. Moreover, although there will often be many possible choices for the order in which to topple vertices, the final configuration does not depend on the chosen order; this is one sense in which the sandpile is \"Abelian\". The number of times each vertex topples in this process is also independent of the choice of toppling order.\n\nOn an arbitrary undirected graph, a special vertex called a \"sink\" is specified that is not allowed to topple. In the presence of a sink, the term \"chip configuration\" refers to a chip-counting vector (nonnegative and integral) indexed by the non-sink vertices. The rules are that any non-sink vertex formula_8 with \nis unstable; toppling again sends one of its chips to each of its neighbors:\nand, for each formula_11:\n\nMultiple toppling operations can be efficiently encoded by using the Laplacian matrix formula_13. Deleting the row and column of formula_13 corresponding with the sink yields the \"reduced Laplacian\" formula_15. If formula_16 is a nonnegative integral vector indexed by the non-sink vertices, then starting with a configuration formula_17 and toppling each vertex formula_8 a total of formula_19 times yields the configuration formula_20.\n\nThis and other models that involve a toppling operation are sometimes referred to as \"chip-firing models\" or \"chip-firing games\".\n\nGiven a configuration formula_17, toppling unstable non-sink vertices on a finite connected graph until no unstable non-sink vertex remains leads to a unique \"stable\" configuration formula_22, which is called the \"stabilization\" of formula_17.\n\nThe set of stable configurations forms a commutative monoid under the operation formula_24. The minimal ideal of this monoid is a group of \"recurrent\" configurations called the \"sandpile group\". A stable configuration is recurrent if it can be obtained from any other configuration by adding chips and stabilizing.\n\nThe sandpile group is isomorphic to the group of equivalence classes of configurations obtained by reducing modulo the toppling operation, which can be written\nwhere formula_26 is the number of vertices and formula_27 is the integer row-span of formula_15.\n\nThe order of the sandpile group is the determinant of formula_15, which by the matrix tree theorem is the number of spanning trees of the graph.\n\nThe original interest behind the model stemmed from the fact that in simulations on lattices, it is attracted to its critical state, at which point the correlation length of the system and the correlation time of the system go to infinity, without any fine tuning of a system parameter. This contrasts with earlier examples of critical phenomena, such as the phase transitions between solid and liquid, or liquid and gas, where the critical point can only be reached by precise tuning (e.g., of temperature). Hence, in the sandpile model we can say that the criticality is self-organized.\n\nOnce the sandpile model reaches its critical state there is no correlation between the system's response to a perturbation and the details of a perturbation. Generally this means that dropping another grain of sand onto the pile may cause nothing to happen, or it may cause the entire pile to collapse in a massive slide. The model also displays 1/\"ƒ\" noise, a feature common to many complex systems in nature.\n\nThis model only displays critical behaviour in two or more dimensions. The sandpile model can be expressed in 1D; however, instead of evolving to its critical state, the 1D sandpile model instead reaches a minimally stable state where every lattice site goes toward the critical slope.\n\nFor two dimensions, the associated conformal field theory is suggested to be symplectic fermions with central charge \"c\" = −2.\n\nThe sandpile model can be generalized to arbitrary directed multigraphs. The rules are that any vertex formula_8 with \nis unstable; toppling again sends chips to each of its neighbors, one along each outgoing edge:\nand, for each formula_33:\nwhere formula_35 is the number of edges from formula_8 to formula_37.\n\nIn this case the Laplacian matrix is not symmetric. If we specify a sink formula_38 such that there is a path from every other vertex to formula_38, then the stabilization operation on finite graphs is well-defined and the sandpile group can be written\nas before.\n\nThe order of the sandpile group is again the determinant of formula_15, which by the general version of the matrix tree theorem is the number of oriented spanning trees rooted at the sink.\n\nThe stabilization of chip configurations obeys a form of \"least action principle\": each vertex topples no more than necessary in the course of the stabilization. \nThis can be formalized as follows. Call a sequence of topples \"legal\" if it only topples unstable vertices, and \"stabilizing\" if it results in a stable configuration. The standard way of stabilizing the sandpile is to find a maximal legal sequence; i.e., by toppling so long as it is possible. Such a sequence is obviously stabilizing, and the Abelian property of the sandpile is that all such sequences are equivalent up to permutation of the toppling order; that is, for any vertex formula_8, the number of times formula_8 topples is the same in all legal stabilizing sequences. According to the least action principle, a minimal stabilizing sequence is also equivalent up to permutation of the toppling order to a legal (and still stabilizing) sequence. In particular, the configuration resulting from a minimal stabilizing sequence is the same as results from a maximal legal sequence.\n\nMore formally, if formula_44 is a vector such that formula_45 is the number of times the vertex formula_8 topples during the stabilization (via the toppling of unstable vertices) of a chip configuration formula_17, and formula_48 is an integral vector (not necessarily non-negative) such that formula_49 is stable, then formula_50 for all vertices formula_8.\n\nA strongly related model is the so called divisible sandpile model, introduced in \n, in which instead of a discrete amount of particles in each site formula_52, there is a real number formula_53 representing the amount of mass on the site. In case such mass is negative, one can understand it as a hole. The topple occurs whenever a site has mass larger than 1, it topples the excess evenly between its neighbors, this means that if a site is full at time formula_54, it will be full for all later times.\n\nThe Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile was mentioned on the Numb3rs episode \"Rampage,\" as mathematician Charlie Eppes explains to his colleagues a solution to a criminal investigation.\n\nThe computer game Hexplode is based around the Abelian sandpile model on a finite hexagonal grid where instead of random grain placement, grains are placed by players.\n\n"}

{"id": "4668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4668", "title": "Binomial coefficient", "text": "Binomial coefficient\n\nIn mathematics, any of the positive integers that occurs as a coefficient in the binomial theorem is a binomial coefficient. Commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers and is written formula_1 It is the coefficient of the term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial power , and it is given by the formula\n\nFor example: \nwhere formula_4, etc.\n\nArranging the numbers formula_5 in successive rows for formula_6 gives a triangular array called Pascal's triangle, satisfying the recurrence relation formula_7.\n\nThe binomial coefficients occur in many areas of mathematics, especially combinatorics.\nThe symbol formula_8 is usually read as \" choose \" because there are formula_8 ways to choose an (unordered) subset of elements from a fixed set of elements. For example, there are formula_10 ways to choose 2 elements from formula_11, namely formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, formula_17.\n\nMany properties of formula_18 also apply to the generalized binomial coefficients formula_19 for any complex number \"z\" and integer \"k\" ≥ 0.\n\nAndreas von Ettingshausen introduced the notation formula_18 in 1826, although the numbers were known centuries earlier (see Pascal's triangle). The earliest known detailed discussion of binomial coefficients is in a tenth-century commentary, by Halayudha, on an ancient Sanskrit text, Pingala's \"Chandaḥśāstra\". In about 1150, the Indian mathematician Bhaskaracharya gave an exposition of binomial coefficients in his book \"Līlāvatī\".\n\nAlternative notations include , , , , , and in all of which the stands for \"combinations\" or \"choices\". Many calculators use variants of the because they can represent it on a single-line display. In this form the binomial coefficients are easily compared to -permutations of, written as , etc.\n\nFor natural numbers (taken to include 0) \"n\" and \"k\", the binomial coefficient formula_18 can be defined as the coefficient of the monomial \"X\" in the expansion of . The same coefficient also occurs (if ) in the binomial formula\n\n(valid for any elements \"x\",\"y\" of a commutative ring),\nwhich explains the name \"binomial coefficient\".\n\nAnother occurrence of this number is in combinatorics, where it gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that \"k\" objects can be chosen from among \"n\" objects; more formally, the number of \"k\"-element subsets (or \"k\"-combinations) of an \"n\"-element set. This number can be seen as equal to the one of the first definition, independently of any of the formulas below to compute it: if in each of the \"n\" factors of the power one temporarily labels the term \"X\" with an index \"i\" (running from 1 to \"n\"), then each subset of \"k\" indices gives after expansion a contribution \"X\", and the coefficient of that monomial in the result will be the number of such subsets. This shows in particular that formula_18 is a natural number for any natural numbers \"n\" and \"k\". There are many other combinatorial interpretations of binomial coefficients (counting problems for which the answer is given by a binomial coefficient expression), for instance the number of words formed of \"n\" bits (digits 0 or 1) whose sum is \"k\" is given by formula_18, while the number of ways to write formula_24 where every \"a\" is a nonnegative integer is given by formula_25. Most of these interpretations are easily seen to be equivalent to counting \"k\"-combinations.\n\nSeveral methods exist to compute the value of formula_18 without actually expanding a binomial power or counting \"k\"-combinations.\n\nOne method uses the recursive, purely additive, formula\n\nwith initial/boundary values\n\nThe formula follows from considering the set {1,2,3,…,\"n\"} and counting separately (a) the \"k\"-element groupings that include a particular set element, say \"\"i\", in every group (since \"i\" is already chosen to fill one spot in every group, we need only choose \"k\" − 1 from the remaining \"n\" − 1) and (b) all the \"k\"-groupings that don't include \"i\"\"; this enumerates all the possible \"k\"-combinations of \"n\" elements. It also follows from tracing the contributions to \"X\" in . As there is zero \"X\" or \"X\" in , one might extend the definition beyond the above boundaries to include formula_18 = 0 when either \"k\" > \"n\" or \"k\" < 0. This recursive formula then allows the construction of Pascal's triangle, surrounded by white spaces where the zeros, or the trivial coefficients, would be.\n\nA more efficient method to compute individual binomial coefficients is given by the formula\n\nwhere the numerator of the first fraction formula_31 is expressed as a falling factorial power.\nThis formula is easiest to understand for the combinatorial interpretation of binomial coefficients.\nThe numerator gives the number of ways to select a sequence of \"k\" distinct objects, retaining the order of selection, from a set of \"n\" objects. The denominator counts the number of distinct sequences that define the same \"k\"-combination when order is disregarded.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the binomial coefficient with regard to \"k\" and \"n\"−\"k\", calculation may be optimised by setting the upper limit of the product above to the smaller of \"k\" and \"n\"−\"k\".\n\nFinally, though computationally unsuitable, there is the compact form, often used in proofs and derivations, which makes repeated use of the familiar factorial function:\n\nwhere \"n\"! denotes the factorial of \"n\". This formula follows from the multiplicative formula above by multiplying numerator and denominator by ; as a consequence it involves many factors common to numerator and denominator. It is less practical for explicit computation (in the case that \"k\" is small and \"n\" is large) unless common factors are first cancelled (in particular since factorial values grow very rapidly). The formula does exhibit a symmetry that is less evident from the multiplicative formula (though it is from the definitions)\n\nwhich leads to a more efficient multiplicative computational routine. Using the falling factorial notation,\n\nThe multiplicative formula allows the definition of binomial coefficients to be extended by replacing \"n\" by an arbitrary number \"α\" (negative, real, complex) or even an element of any commutative ring in which all positive integers are invertible:\n\nWith this definition one has a generalization of the binomial formula (with one of the variables set to 1), which justifies still calling the formula_35 binomial coefficients:\n\nThis formula is valid for all complex numbers \"α\" and \"X\" with |\"X\"| < 1. It can also be interpreted as an identity of formal power series in \"X\", where it actually can serve as definition of arbitrary powers of power series with constant coefficient equal to 1; the point is that with this definition all identities hold that one expects for exponentiation, notably\n\nIf \"α\" is a nonnegative integer \"n\", then all terms with \"k\" > \"n\" are zero, and the infinite series becomes a finite sum, thereby recovering the binomial formula. However, for other values of \"α\", including negative integers and rational numbers, the series is really infinite.\n\nPascal's rule is the important recurrence relation\n\nwhich can be used to prove by mathematical induction that formula_37 is a natural number for all \"n\" and \"k\", a fact that is not immediately obvious from formula (1).\n\nPascal's rule also gives rise to Pascal's triangle:\n\nRow number \"n\" contains the numbers formula_37 for \"k\" = 0,…,\"n\". It is constructed by starting with ones at the outside and then always adding two adjacent numbers and writing the sum directly underneath. This method allows the quick calculation of binomial coefficients without the need for fractions or multiplications. For instance, by looking at row number 5 of the triangle, one can quickly read off that\nThe differences between elements on other diagonals are the elements in the previous diagonal, as a consequence of the recurrence relation () above.\n\nBinomial coefficients are of importance in combinatorics, because they provide ready formulas for certain frequent counting problems:\n\nFor any nonnegative integer \"k\", the expression formula_45 can be simplified and defined as a polynomial divided by \"k\"!:\n\nthis presents a polynomial in \"t\" with rational coefficients.\n\nAs such, it can be evaluated at any real or complex number \"t\" to define binomial coefficients with such first arguments.\nThese \"generalized binomial coefficients\" appear in Newton's generalized binomial theorem.\n\nFor each \"k\", the polynomial formula_47 can be characterized as the unique degree \"k\" polynomial \"p\"(\"t\") satisfying \"p\"(0) = \"p\"(1) = ... = \"p\"(\"k\" − 1) = 0 and \"p\"(\"k\") = 1.\n\nIts coefficients are expressible in terms of Stirling numbers of the first kind:\nThe derivative of formula_47 can be calculated by logarithmic differentiation:\n\nOver any field of characteristic 0 (that is, any field that contains the rational numbers), each polynomial \"p\"(\"t\") of degree at most \"d\" is uniquely expressible as a linear combination formula_51 of binomial coefficients. The coefficient \"a\" is the \"k\"th difference of the sequence \"p\"(0), \"p\"(1), …, \"p\"(\"k\").\nExplicitly,\n\nEach polynomial formula_47 is integer-valued: it has an integer value at all integer inputs formula_53.\nTherefore, any integer linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials is integer-valued too.\nConversely, () shows that any integer-valued polynomial is an integer linear combination of these binomial coefficient polynomials.\nMore generally, for any subring \"R\" of a characteristic 0 field \"K\", a polynomial in \"K\"[\"t\"] takes values in \"R\" at all integers if and only if it is an \"R\"-linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials.\n\nThe integer-valued polynomial 3\"t\"(3\"t\" + 1)/2 can be rewritten as\n\nThe factorial formula facilitates relating nearby binomial coefficients. For instance, if \"k\" is a positive integer and \"n\" is arbitrary, then\n\nand, with a little more work,\nMoreover, the following may be useful:\nFor constant \"n\", we have the following recurrence:\n\nThe formula\n\nsays the elements in the \"n\" row of Pascal's triangle always add up to 2 raised to the \"n\" power. This is obtained from the binomial theorem () by setting \"x\" = 1 and \"y\" = 1. The formula also has a natural combinatorial interpretation: the left side sums the number of subsets of {1...,\"n\"} of sizes \"k\" = 0,1...,\"n\", giving the total number of subsets. (That is, the left side counts the power set of {1...,\"n\"}.) However, these subsets can also be generated by successively choosing or excluding each element 1...,\"n\"; the \"n\" independent binary choices (bit-strings) allow a total of formula_58 choices. The left and right sides are two ways to count the same collection of subsets, so they are equal. \n\nThe formulas\n\nand\nformula_59\nfollow from () after differentiating with respect to \"x\" (twice in the latter) and then substituting \"x\" = 1.\n\nThe Chu–Vandermonde identity, which holds for any complex-values \"m\" and \"n\" and any non-negative integer \"k\", is\n\nand can be found by examination of the coefficient of formula_60 in the expansion of (1 + \"x\") (1 + \"x\") = (1 + \"x\") using equation (). When \"m\" = 1, equation () reduces to equation (). In the special case \"n\" = 2\"m\", \"k\" = \"m\", using (), the expansion () becomes (as seen in Pascal's triangle at right)\nwhere the term on the right side is a central binomial coefficient.\n\nAnother form of the Chu–Vandermonde identity, which applies for any integers \"j\", \"k\", and \"n\" satisfying 0 ≤ \"j\" ≤ \"k\" ≤ \"n\", is\n\nThe proof is similar, but uses the binomial series expansion () with negative integer exponents.\nWhen \"j\" = \"k\", equation () gives the hockey-stick identity\n\nLet \"F\"(\"n\") denote the \"n\"-th Fibonacci number.\nThen\nThis can be proved by induction using () or by Zeckendorf's representation. A combinatorial proof is given below.\n\nFor integers \"s\" and \"t\" such that formula_63 series multisection gives the following identity for the sum of binomial coefficients:\n\nFor small \"s\", these series have particularly nice forms; for example,\n\nAlthough there is no closed formula for partial sums\n\nof binomial coefficients, one can again use () and induction to show that for \"k\" = 0, ..., \"n\" − 1,\n\nwith special case\n\nfor \"n\" > 0. This latter result is also a special case of the result from the theory of finite differences that for any polynomial \"P\"(\"x\") of degree less than \"n\",\nDifferentiating () \"k\" times and setting \"x\" = −1 yields this for\nformula_76,\nwhen 0 ≤ \"k\" < \"n\",\nand the general case follows by taking linear combinations of these.\n\nWhen \"P\"(\"x\") is of degree less than or equal to \"n\",\n\nwhere formula_77 is the coefficient of degree \"n\" in \"P\"(\"x\").\n\nMore generally for (),\nwhere \"m\" and \"d\" are complex numbers. This follows immediately applying () to the polynomial \"Q(x):=P(m + dx)\" instead of \"P(x)\", and observing that \"Q(x)\" has still degree less than or equal to \"n\", and that its coefficient of degree \"n\" is \"da\".\n\nThe series\nformula_79 is convergent for \"k\" ≥ 2. This formula is used in the analysis of the German tank problem. It follows from formula_80\nwhich is proved by induction on \"M\".\n\nMany identities involving binomial coefficients can be proved by combinatorial means. For example, for nonnegative integers formula_81, the identity\n\n(which reduces to () when \"q\" = 1) can be given a double counting proof, as follows. The left side counts the number of ways of selecting a subset of [\"n\"] = {1, 2, …, \"n\"} with at least \"q\" elements, and marking \"q\" elements among those selected. The right side counts the same thing, because there are formula_83 ways of choosing a set of \"q\" elements to mark, and formula_84 to choose which of the remaining elements of [\"n\"] also belong to the subset.\n\nIn Pascal's identity\nboth sides count the number of \"k\"-element subsets of [\"n\"]: the two terms on the right side group them into those that contain element \"n\" and those that do not.\n\nThe identity () also has a combinatorial proof. The identity reads\n\nSuppose you have formula_87 empty squares arranged in a row and you want to mark (select) \"n\" of them. There are formula_88 ways to do this. On the other hand, you may select your \"n\" squares by selecting \"k\" squares from among the first \"n\" and formula_89 squares from the remaining \"n\" squares; any \"k\" from 0 to \"n\" will work. This gives\nNow apply () to get the result.\n\nIf one denotes by the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, indexed so that , then the identity \nformula_91\nhas the following combinatorial proof. One may show by induction that counts the number of ways that a strip of squares may be covered by and tiles. On the other hand, if such a tiling uses exactly of the tiles, then it uses of the tiles, and so uses tiles total. There are formula_92 ways to order these tiles, and so summing this coefficient over all possible values of gives the identity.\n\nThe number of \"k\"-combinations for all \"k\", formula_93, is the sum of the \"n\"th row (counting from 0) of the binomial coefficients. These combinations are enumerated by the 1 digits of the set of base 2 numbers counting from 0 to formula_94, where each digit position is an item from the set of \"n\".\n\nDixon's identity is\n\nor, more generally,\n\nwhere \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" are non-negative integers.\n\nCertain trigonometric integrals have values expressible in terms of\nbinomial coefficients:\n\nFor formula_97\n\nThese can be proved by using Euler's formula to convert trigonometric functions to complex exponentials, expanding using the binomial theorem, and integrating term by term.\n\nFor a fixed , the ordinary generating function of the sequence formula_101 is\n\nFor a fixed , the ordinary generating function of the sequence formula_103 is\n\nThe bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients is\n\nAnother, symmetric, bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients is\n\nA symmetric exponential bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients is:\n\nIn 1852, Kummer proved that if \"m\" and \"n\" are nonnegative integers and \"p\" is a prime number, then the largest power of \"p\" dividing formula_108 equals \"p\", where \"c\" is the number of carries when \"m\" and \"n\" are added in base \"p\".\nEquivalently, the exponent of a prime \"p\" in formula_39\nequals the number of nonnegative integers \"j\" such that the fractional part of \"k\"/\"p\" is greater than the fractional part of \"n\"/\"p\". It can be deduced from this that formula_39 is divisible by \"n\"/gcd(\"n\",\"k\"). In particular therefore it follows that \"p\" divides formula_111 for all positive integers \"r\" and \"s\" such that \"s\" < \"p\". However this is not true of higher powers of \"p\": for example 9 does not divide formula_112.\n\nA somewhat surprising result by David Singmaster (1974) is that any integer divides almost all binomial coefficients. More precisely, fix an integer \"d\" and let \"f\"(\"N\") denote the number of binomial coefficients formula_39 with \"n\" < \"N\" such that \"d\" divides formula_39. Then\nSince the number of binomial coefficients formula_39 with \"n\" < \"N\" is \"N\"(\"N\" + 1) / 2, this implies that the density of binomial coefficients divisible by \"d\" goes to 1.\n\nBinomial coefficients have divisibility properties related to least common multiples of consecutive integers. For example:\n\nformula_117 divides formula_118.\n\nformula_117 is a multiple of formula_120.\n\nAnother fact:\nAn integer \"n\" ≥ 2 is prime if and only if\nall the intermediate binomial coefficients\nare divisible by \"n\".\n\nProof:\nWhen \"p\" is prime, \"p\" divides\nbecause formula_123 is a natural number and \"p\" divides the numerator but not the denominator.\nWhen \"n\" is composite, let \"p\" be the smallest prime factor of \"n\" and let \"k\" = n/p. Then 0 < \"p\" < \"n\" and\notherwise the numerator \"k\"(\"n\" − 1)(\"n\" − 2)×...×(\"n\" − \"p\" + 1) has to be divisible by \"n\" = \"k\"×\"p\", this can only be the case when (\"n\" − 1)(\"n\" − 2)×...×(\"n\" − \"p\" + 1) is divisible by \"p\".

It was invented by David G. Cantor and Hans Zassenhaus in 1981.\n\nIt is arguably the dominant algorithm for solving the problem, having replaced the earlier Berlekamp's algorithm of 1967. It is currently implemented in many computer algebra systems.\n\nThe Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm takes as input a squarefree polynomial formula_1 (i.e. one with no repeated factors) of degree \"n\" with coefficients in a finite field formula_2 whose irreducible polynomial factors are all of equal degree (algorithms exist for efficiently factoring arbitrary polynomials into a product of polynomials satisfying these conditions, for instance, formula_3 is a squarefree polynomial with the same factors as formula_1, so that the Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm can be used to factor arbitrary polynomials). It gives as output a polynomial formula_5 with coefficients in the same field such that formula_5 divides formula_1. The algorithm may then be applied recursively to these and subsequent divisors, until we find the decomposition of formula_1 into powers of irreducible polynomials (recalling that the ring of polynomials over any field is a unique factorisation domain).\n\nAll possible factors of formula_1 are contained within the factor ring\nformula_10. If we suppose that formula_1 has irreducible factors formula_12, all of degree \"d\", then this factor ring is isomorphic to the direct product of factor rings formula_13. The isomorphism from \"R\" to \"S\", say formula_14, maps a polynomial formula_15 to the \"s\"-tuple of its reductions modulo each of the formula_16, i.e. if:\n\nformula_17\n\nthen formula_18. It is important to note the following at this point, as it shall be of critical importance later in the algorithm: Since the formula_16 are each irreducible, each of the factor rings in this direct sum is in fact a field. These fields each have degree formula_20.\n\nThe core result underlying the Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm is the following: If formula_21 is a polynomial satisfying:\n\nwhere formula_24 is the reduction of formula_25 modulo formula_16 as before, and if any two of the following three sets is non-empty:\n\nthen there exist the following non-trivial factors of formula_1:\n\nThe Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm computes polynomials of the same type as formula_25 above using the isomorphism discussed in the Background section. It proceeds as follows, in the case where the field formula_2 is of odd-characteristic. The process can be generalised to characteristic 2 fields in a fairly straightforward way: Select a random polynomial formula_36 such that formula_37. Set formula_38 and compute formula_39. Since formula_14 is an isomorphism, we have (using our now-established notation):\n\nNow, each formula_42 is an element of a field of order formula_20, as noted earlier. The multiplicative subgroup of this field has order formula_44 and so, unless formula_45, we have formula_46 for each \"i\" and hence formula_47 for each \"i\". If formula_45, then of course formula_49. Hence formula_39 is a polynomial of the same type as formula_25 above. Further, since formula_52, at least two of the sets formula_53 and \"C\" are non-empty and by computing the above GCDs we may obtain non-trivial factors. Since the ring of polynomials over a field is a Euclidean domain, we may compute these GCDs using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nOne important application of the Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm is in computing discrete logarithms over finite fields of prime-power order. Computing discrete logarithms is an important problem in public key cryptography. For a field of prime-power order, the fastest known method is the index calculus method, which involves the factorisation of field elements. If we represent the prime-power order field in the usual way – that is, as polynomials over the prime order base field, reduced modulo an irreducible polynomial of appropriate degree – then this is simply polynomial factorisation, as provided by the Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm.\n\nThe Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm is implemented in the PARI/GP computer algebra system as the factorcantor() function.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "159280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159280", "title": "Change ringing", "text": "Change ringing\n\nChange ringing is the art of ringing a set of tuned bells in a controlled manner to produce variations in their striking sequences. This may be by method ringing in which the ringers commit to memory the rules for generating each change, or by call changes, where the ringers are instructed how to generate each new change by calls from a conductor. This creates a form of bell music which cannot be discerned as a conventional melody.\n\nChange ringing originated following the invention of English full-circle tower bell ringing in the early 17th century, when bell ringers found that swinging a bell through a much larger arc than that required for swing-chiming gave control over the time between successive strikes of the clapper. Ordinarily a bell will swing through a small arc only at a set speed governed by its size and shape in the nature of a simple pendulum, but by swinging through a larger arc approaching a full circle, control of the strike interval can be exercised by the ringer. This culminated in the technique of full circle ringing, which enabled ringers to independently change the speeds of their individual bells accurately to combine in ringing different mathematical permutations, known as \"changes\". \nSpeed control of a tower bell is exerted by the ringer only when each bell is mouth upwards and moving slowly near the balance point; this constraint and the intricate rope manipulation involved normally requires that each bell has its own ringer. The considerable weights of full-circle tower bells also means they cannot be easily stopped or started and the practical change of interval between successive strikes is limited. This places limitations on the rules for generating easily-rung changes; each bell must strike once in each change, but its position of striking in successive changes can only change by one place.\n\nChange ringing is practised worldwide, but it is by far most common on church bells in English churches, where it first developed. \nChange ringing is also performed on handbells, where conventionally each ringer holds two bells, and chimed on carillons and chimes of bells; though these are more commonly used to play conventional melodies.\n\nToday, some towers have as many as sixteen bells that can be rung together, though six or eight bells are more common. The highest pitch bell is known as the \"treble\", and the lowest is the \"tenor\". For convenience, the bells are referred to by number, with the treble being number 1 and the other bells numbered by their pitch—2,3,4, etc.—sequentially down the scale. (This system often seems counter-intuitive to musicians, who are used to a numbering that ascends with pitch.) The bells are usually tuned to a diatonic major scale, with the tenor bell being the tonic (or key) note of the scale. Some towers contain additional bells so that different subsets of the full number can be rung, still to a diatonic scale. For instance, many 12-bell towers have a \"flat sixth\", which if rung instead of the normal number 6 bell allows 2 to 9 to be rung as light diatonic octave; other variations are also possible.\n\nThe bells in a tower reside in the \"bell chamber\" or \"belfry\" usually with louvred windows to enable the sound to escape.\n\nThe bells are mounted within a \"bellframe\" of steel or wood. Each bell is suspended from a \"headstock\" fitted on trunnions (plain or non-friction bearings) mounted to the belfry framework so that the bell assembly can rotate. When stationary in the \"down\" position, the centre of mass of the bell and clapper is appreciably below the centreline of the trunnion supports, giving a pendulous effect to the assembly, and this dynamic is controlled by the ringer's rope. The headstock is fitted with a wooden \"stay\", which, in conjunction with a \"slider\", limits maximum rotational movement to a little less than 370 degrees. To the headstock a large wooden wheel is fitted and to which a rope is attached. The rope wraps and unwraps as the bell rotates backwards and forwards. This is full circle ringing and quite different from fixed or limited motion bells, which \"chime\". Within the bell the \"clapper\" is constrained to swing in the direction that the bell swings. The clapper is a rigid steel or wrought iron bar with a large ball to strike the bell. The thickest part of the mouth of bell is called the soundbow and it is against this that the ball strikes. Beyond the ball is a \"flight\", which controls the speed of the clapper. In very small bells this can be nearly as long as the rest of the clapper.\n\nBelow the bell chamber there may be one or more sound chambers, (one of which is likely to house the clock mechanism if the church has one) and through which the rope passes before it drops into the \"ringing chamber\" or room. Typically, the rope's length is such that it falls close to or on to the floor of the ringing chamber. About from the floor, the rope has a woolen grip called the \"sally\" (usually around long) while the lower end of the rope is doubled over to form an easily held \"tail-end\".\n\nUnattended bells are normally left hanging in the normal (\"down\") position but prior to being rung, the bells are \"rung up\". In the down position, the bells are safe if a person touches them or pulls a rope. A bell that is up is dangerous to be near, and only expert ringers should ever contemplate entering a bell chamber or touching a rope when the bells are up. The ringer pulls on the rope and starts the bell swinging. Each time the bell swings the ringer adds a little more energy to the system, similar to pushing a child's swing. Eventually there is enough energy for the bell to swing right up and be left over-centre just beyond the balance point with the stay resting against the slider.\n\nBellringers typically stand in a circle around the ringing chamber, each managing one rope. Bells and their attendant ropes are so mounted that the ropes are pulled in a circular sequence, usually clockwise, starting with the lightest (treble) bell and descending to the heaviest (tenor). To ring the bell, the ringer first pulls the sally towards the floor, upsetting the bell's balance and swinging it on its bearings. As the bell swings downwards the rope unwinds from the wheel and the ringer adds enough pull to counteract friction and air resistance. The bell winds the rope back onto the other side of the wheel as it rises and the ringer can slow (or \"check\") the rise of the bell if required.\n\nThe rope is attached to one side of the wheel so that a different amount of rope is wound on and off as it swings to and fro. The first stroke is the \"handstroke\" with a small amount of rope on the wheel. The ringer pulls on the sally and when the bell swings up it draws up more rope onto the wheel and the sally rises to, or beyond, the ceiling. The ringer keeps hold of the tail-end of the rope to control the bell. After a controlled pause with the bell, on or close to its balancing point, the ringer rings the \"backstroke\" by pulling the tail-end, causing the bell to swing back towards its starting position. As the sally rises, the ringer catches it to pause the bell at its balance position.\n\nIn English-style ringing the bell is rung up such that the clapper is resting on the lower edge of the bell when the bell is on the stay. During each swing, the clapper travels faster than the bell, eventually striking the soundbow and making the bell sound. The bell \"speaks\" roughly when horizontal as it rises, thus projecting the sound outwards. The clapper rebounds very slightly, allowing the bell to ring. At the balance point, the clapper passes over the top and rests against the soundbow.\n\nIn change ringing where the order the bells are struck in is constantly altered, it is necessary to time the swing so that this strike occurs with precise positioning within the overall pattern. Precision of striking is important at all times. To ring quickly, the bell must not complete the full 360 degrees before swinging back in the opposite direction, while ringing slowly the ringer waits with the bell held at the balance, before allowing it to swing back. To achieve this, the ringer must work with the bell's momentum, applying just the right amount of effort during the pull that the bell swings as far as required and no further. This allows two adjacent bells to reverse positions; the quicker bell passing the slower bell to establish a new pattern. Although ringing up certainly involves some physical exertion, actual ringing should rely more on practised skill than mere brute force. Even the smallest bell in a tower is much heavier than the person ringing it. The heaviest bell hung for full-circle ringing is in Liverpool Cathedral and weighs . Despite this colossal weight, it can be safely rung by one (experienced) ringer.\n\nThe simplest way to sound a ring of bells is by ringing \"rounds\". This is a repeated sequence of bells descending from the highest to lowest note, which is from the lightest to the heaviest bell. This was the original sequence used before change ringing was developed, and change ringing always starts and ends with this sequence.\n\nTwo forms of ringing changes have developed;\n\nMost ringers begin their ringing career with call change ringing; they can thus concentrate on learning the physical skills needed to handle their bells without needing to worry about \"methods\". There are also many towers where experienced ringers practise call change ringing as an art in its own right (and even exclusively), particularly in the English county of Devon.\n\nThe technique was probably developed in the early 17th century in the early days of change ringing.\n\nCall change ringing requires one ringer to give commands to change the order of the bells, as distinct from method ringing, where the ringers memorise the course of bells as part of a continuous pattern.\n\nIn \"call change ringing\" each different sequence of the bells, known as a \"row\", is specifically called out by one ringer, the \"conductor\", who instructs the other ringers how to change their bells' places from row to row. This command is known as a \"call\".\n\nThe change is made at the next \"handstroke\" (when the sally on the bell rope is pulled), after the call. In calling, the conductor usually has a strategy or plan to achieve the desired progression of rows, rather than remembering each call, and an example of these is shown in the example on eight bells. Conductors can space out the calls at will, but each row is normally struck twice at least because of the difficulty of calling continuous changes.\n\nCalls are usually of the form \"X to (or after) Y\" or \"X and Y\"; in which X and Y refer to two of the bells by their physical numbers in the tower (not by their positions in the row). All cause two bells to swap. The first form is used for \"calling up\" and \"calling down\", and the second form swaps the two bells mentioned.\n\nAs an example of calling up and down, consider the following sequence of rows, and the calls a conductor would use to call them:\n\nThus it can be seen how these ways of calling differ:\n\nIn all cases, the ringer of the bell immediately above (behind) the swapping pair must also be alert, as that bell follows a new bell after the swap. Rarer forms of change calling may name just one of the moving bells, call the moving bell by position rather than number, or call out the full change.\n\nThe example on the right shows called changes eight bells being called using the \"down\" system. The sequence of calls shown gives three well-known musical rows, which are Whittingtons, Queens, and Tittums.\n\n\nMethod ringing is the continuously changing form of change ringing, and gets its name from the use of a particular \"method\" to generate the changes.\n\nAfter starting in repetitive rounds, at a given command, the ringers vary the bells' order, to produce a series of distinct sequences known as \"rows\" or \"changes\". In this way permutation of the bells' striking order proceeds. For example \"123456\" can become \"214365\" in the next sequence.\n\nThe method is committed to memory by each ringer, so that only a few commands are given by the ringer in charge (the conductor). Learning the method does not consist of memorising the individual sequences, but using a variety of techniques such as:\n\nThere are thousands of different methods, and Plain Bob Minor, a method on six bells, is shown in the accompanying diagram below.\n\nIn method ringing, plain hunt is the simplest form of generating changing permutations in a continuous fashion, and is a fundamental building-block of many change ringing methods. The accompanying diagram shows plain hunt on six bells. The course of two bells only are shown for clarity. Each row in the diagram shows the order of striking after each change.\n\nPlain hunt consists of a plain undeviating course of a bell between the first and last places in the striking order, by moving a place in the sequence at each change, but with two strikes in the first and last position to enable a turn-around as the internal bells change over.\n\nThus each bell moves one position at each succeeding change, unless they reach the first or last position, where they remain for two changes then proceed to the other end of the sequence. All of the bells are doing this at every change, without any words of command.\n\nThis simple rule can be extended to any number of bells, however it repeats the sequence after twice the number of bells hunting.\n\nTo enable a greater number of changes to be rung without repetition, more advanced methods were developed, many based upon the plain hunt. \"Plain Bob\" is one of the oldest and simplest of these, and is shown as an example above.\n\nA \"plain course\" of plain bob minor is shown in diagrammatic form, which has the characteristics;\n\nThe red bell track shows the order of \"works\", which are deviations from the plain hunt.\nAnd then it repeats. Each bells starts at a different place in this cyclical order. \nA dodge means just that; two bells dodge round each other, thus changing their relationship to the treble, and giving rise to different changes.\n\nThe plain bob pattern can be extended beyond the constraints of the plain course of 60 changes, to the full unique 720 changes possible ( this is factorial 6 on 6 bells, which is 1×2×3×4×5×6 = 720 changes). To do this, at set points in the sequences one of the ringers, called the \"conductor\" calls out commands such as \"bob\" or \"single\", which introduce further variations. The conductor follows a \"composition\" which they have to commit to memory. This enables the other ringers to produce large numbers of unique changes without memorising huge quantities of data, without any written prompts.\n\nRingers can also ring different methods, with different \"works\" on different numbers of bells - so there is a huge variety of ways of ringing changes in method ringing.\n\nFor some people, the ultimate goal of this system is to ring \"all\" the permutations, to ring a tower's bells in every possible order without repeating – what is called an \"extent\" (or sometimes, formerly, a \"full peal\"). The feasibility of this depends on how many bells are involved: if a tower has \"n\" bells, they have \"n\"! (read factorial) possible permutations, a number that becomes quite large as \"n\" grows.\n\nFor example, while six bells have 720 permutations, eight bells have 40,320; furthermore, 10! = 3,628,800, and 12! = 479,001,600. Estimating two seconds for each change (a reasonable pace), one finds that while an extent on six bells can be accomplished in half an hour, an extent on eight bells should take nearly twenty-two and a half hours. (When in 1963 ringers in Loughborough became the only band in history to achieve this feat on tower bells, it took them just under 18 hours.) An extent on 12 bells would take over thirty years.\n\nSince extents are obviously not always practicable, ringers more often undertake shorter performances. Such ringing starts and ends with rounds, having meanwhile visited only a subset of the available permutations; but \"truth\" is still considered essential — no row can ever be repeated; to do so would make the ringing \"false\". A \"peal\" is an extended performance; it must last at least 5000 changes on eight or more bells and at least 5040 on seven or fewer bells (5040 being 7!, the length of a full extent on seven). A performance of 1250 (on 8 or more) or 1260 (on 7 or fewer) changes likewise makes a \"quarter peal\" (\"quarter\" for short); a peal or a quarter tends to last about three hours or 45 minutes, respectively.\n\nChange ringing can also be performed on handbells, and is quite popular in its own right. Many record-length peals, including the longest peal ever rung, are by handbell ringers.\n\nNormally each ringer has a bell in each hand and sit or stand in a circle (like tower ringers). The tower bell terms of \"handstroke\" and \"backstroke\" are retained, referring to an upwards and downwards ring of the bell respectively; and as in towers, the ringing proceeds in alternate rows of handstroke and backstroke.\n\nOccasionally, a technique called \"lapping\", or \"cross and stretch\" is used. Ringers stand or sit in a straight line at a single convenient table on which the bells are placed. They pick up a bell each time they ring it, and then put it down. As the bell sequence changes, however, the ringers physically swap the bells accordingly—so the bells move up and down the table and each row is rung in strict sequence from right to left. Ringers in cross and stretch thus do not have responsibility for their own personal bell, but handle each as it comes.\n\nSome handbell change ringers practice a hybrid of these two methods, known as \"body ringing\": ringers standing in a line each hold one bell, exchanging places in the line so that the changes sound correctly when the bells are rung in sequence from right to left.\n\nChange ringing as we know it today emerged in England in the 17th century. To that era we can trace the origins of the earliest ringing societies, such as the \"Lincoln Cathedral Guild\", which claims to date to 1612 or the \"Antient Society of Ringers of St Stephen\" in Bristol, which was founded in 1620 and lasted as a ringing society until the late 19th century. The recreation began to flourish in earnest in the Restoration era; an important milestone in the development of method ringing as a careful science was the 1668 publication by Richard Duckworth and Fabian Stedman of their book \"Tintinnalogia\", which promised in its subtitle to lay down \"plain and easie Rules for Ringing all sorts of Plain Changes.\" Stedman followed this in 1677 with another famous early guide, \"Campanalogia.\"\n\nThroughout the years since, the group theoretical underpinnings of change ringing have been pursued by mathematicians. \"Changes\" can be viewed as permutations; sets of permutations constitute mathematical groups, which in turn can be depicted via so-called Cayley graphs, which in turn can be mapped onto polyhedra. \n\nBells have been installed in towers around the world and many rings in the British Isles have been augmented to ten, twelve, fourteen, or even sixteen bells. Today change ringing is, particularly in England, a popular and commonplace sound, often issuing from a church tower before or after a service or wedding. While on these everyday occasions the ringers must usually content themselves with shorter \"touches,\" each lasting a few minutes, for special occasions they often attempt a quarter-peal or peal, lasting approximately 45 minutes or three hours respectively. If a peal attempt succeeds, towers sometimes mark the occasion with a peal board mounted on the wall of the ringing chamber; at St Peter Mancroft in Norwich there is one documenting what is generally considered to have been the first true peal: 5040 changes of \"Plain Bob Triples\" (a method still popular today), rung 2 May 1715. There is some evidence there may have been an earlier peal (also Plain Bob Triples), rung January 7, 1690 at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate in the City of London by the Ancient Society of College Youths. Today over 4000 peals are rung each year.\n\nThe Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, founded in 1891, is dedicated to representing change ringers around the world. Most regional and local ringing guilds are affiliated with the council. Its journal, \"The Ringing World\", has been published weekly since 1911; in addition to news and features relating to bellringing and the bellringing community, it publishes records of achievements such as peals and quarter-peals. Ringers generally adhere to the Council's rules and definitions governing change ringing.\n\nThe Central Council, by means of its peal records, also keeps track of record length peals, both on tower bells and handbells. (The record for tower bells remains the 1963 Loughborough extent of Plain Bob Major [40,320 changes]; for handbells it was set in 2007 in Willingham, Cambridgeshire, with 72,000 changes of 100 different Treble Dodging Minor methods, taking just over 24 hours to ring) More importantly, perhaps, along with keeping track of the first peal ever rung in a method, the Central Council controls the naming of new methods: it generally allows the first band to ring a method to name it.\n\nMuch ringing is carried out by bands of ringers meeting at their local tower to ring its bells. For the sake of variety, though, many ringers like to take occasional trips to make a \"tower grab\" ringing the bells of a less familiar tower. The setting, the church architecture, the chance to ring more bells than usual, the bells' unique tone, their ease or difficulty of ringing, and sometimes even the unusual means of accessing the ringing chamber can all be part of the attraction. The traditional means of finding bell towers, and still the most popular way today, is the book (and now internet database) \"Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers\".\n\nMethods of change ringing are named for the number of working bells, or the bells that switch order within the change. It takes a pair to switch, and commonly the largest bell (the tenor) does not change place. For example, there may be six bells, only five of which work, allowing for only two pairs. A method of ringing for these bells would be called \"doubles\". Doubles is the most common group of methods rung in the United Kingdom, since the majority of parish churches with bell towers in the UK are fitted with only six bells.\n\n\"Plain Bob Doubles\" is a method rung on five bells whereas \"Plain Bob Triples\" is the same method rung on seven working bells.\n\nThere are two separate ways to refer to the number of bells. One way is used for even numbers, the other for an odd number.\n\nThe name for 9 bells is pronounced \"kate-ers\" and comes from the French \"quatres\". The name for 11 bells also comes from the French and is pronounced \"sinks\" c.f. Cinque Ports.\n\nThe names refer to the number of bells which change places in each row. With three bells only one pair can change, and so it is singles. With seven bells there are clearly three pairs with the one left over not moving this row.\n\nMathematical abstraction though each row may be, some rows do have a musical or melodic meaning to the listener. Over the years, a number of these have acquired names — they are \"named changes\". Both the conductors directing call-change ringing and the \"composers\" coming up with plans for a bout of method ringing sometimes like to work their favourite named changes in. The table below lists some popular named changes on eight bells; many of these names are also applicable by extension on more or fewer bells.\n\nSuch names are often humorous; for example, the sequence 14235 on five bells is called \"weasels\" because it is the tune of the refrain to the children's song \"Pop Goes the Weasel\". This is particularly effective at the end of ringing down. The bells are in order, and so if not chimed leave a pause, the sequence becomes: 1..4..23.5 where a dot indicates a pause.\n\nCalled changes are listed at MAW Call Change Collection\n\nAlthough neither call change nor method ringing produces conventional tunes, it is still the aim of the ringers to produce a pleasant sound. One of the most important aspects of this is \"good striking\" — not only should the bells never \"clash\" by sounding at the same moment, the bells should sound to a perfect rhythm, tapping out a steady beat.\n\nIt is the custom to leave a pause of one beat after every alternate row, i.e., after the ringing of each ‘backstroke’ row. This is called 'open handstroke' ringing (or open handstroke leading). In Devon, Cornwall and parts of Yorkshire, this custom is not followed when call-change ringing; instead the bells strike steadily without the pause. This latter custom is known as the \"closed-hand\" or \"cartwheel\" arrangement. However for method ringing the universal practice is to ring with open handstrokes, even in the South West of England.\n\nStriking competitions are held where various bands of ringers attempt to ring with their best striking. They are judged on their number of \"faults\" (striking errors); the band with the fewest faults wins. These competitions are organized on regional and national levels, being particularly popular among the call-change ringers of Devon where it is customary to include the quality of the rise and lower of the bells as part of the judging criteria. Competitions for method ringers usually start \"off the stay\"—i.e., the bells are rung up before the competition begins. At the annual National 12 Bell Striking Contest the bands are ringing methods and producing a different change approximately every 2.5 seconds, with a gap between bells of 0.21 seconds. To an expert ringer's ear at this level of competition a variation of a tenth of this would be discernible as a striking fault.\n\nIn 2016 readers of \"The Ringing World\" magazine wrote to insist that bell ringing was \"an art and a sport\", as demonstrated by regular \"striking competitions.\" It was suggested that classification of change ringing as a sport by Sport England could save it from becoming obsolete. But the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers opposed the move, suggesting that it would jeopardise its relationship with church bodies, since bell ringing should be seen as part of Christian worship, not exercise. The council's president, Chris Mew, said: \"Where is the glamour of the sports field and where are the David Beckhams of the belfry?\"\n\nThe mystery novel \"The Nine Tailors\" by Dorothy L. Sayers (1934) contains a great deal of information on change-ringing. Her fictional detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, demonstrates his skill at ringing, and the solution to the central puzzle of the book rests in part upon his knowledge of the patterns of change ringing.\n\nConnie Willis, who frequently and overtly references Sayers in \"To Say Nothing of the Dog\" (1997), features bell ringers in her earlier novel \"Doomsday Book\" (1992); a group of American women led by a Mrs. Taylor frequently appears practising for or ringing both handbells and changes.\n\nThe British television series \"Midsomer Murders\" aired an episode in the fifth season on a series of murders within a bell-ringing team, in \"Ring Out Your Dead\".\n\nIn the science-fiction novel \"Anathem\" by Neal Stephenson (2008) changes are rung in a cloistered monastery for mathematicians to signal different ceremonies.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5244", "title": "Cipher", "text": "Cipher\n\nIn cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is \"encipherment\". To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, \"cipher\" is synonymous with \"code\", as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.\n\nCodes generally substitute different length strings of characters in the output, while ciphers generally substitute the same number of characters as are input. There are exceptions and some cipher systems may use slightly more, or fewer, characters when output versus the number that were input.\n\nCodes operated by substituting according to a large codebook which linked a random string of characters or numbers to a word or phrase. For example, \"UQJHSE\" could be the code for \"Proceed to the following coordinates.\" When using a cipher the original information is known as plaintext, and the encrypted form as ciphertext. The ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message, but is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it.\n\nThe operation of a cipher usually depends on a piece of auxiliary information, called a key (or, in traditional NSA parlance, a \"cryptovariable\"). The encrypting procedure is varied depending on the key, which changes the detailed operation of the algorithm. A key must be selected before using a cipher to encrypt a message. Without knowledge of the key, it should be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to decrypt the resulting ciphertext into readable plaintext.\n\nMost modern ciphers can be categorized in several ways\n\nThe word \"cipher\" (minority spelling \"cypher\") in former times meant \"zero\" and had the same origin: Middle French as ' and Medieval Latin as \"cifra,\" from the Arabic صفر\"' \"sifr\" = zero (see Zero—Etymology). \"Cipher\" was later used for any decimal digit, even any number. There are many theories about how the word \"cipher\" may have come to mean \"encoding\". In fact the more ancient source of word \"Cypher\" is the ancient Hebrew; there are more than 100 verses in the Hebrew Bible - Torah using word \"Cepher\": means (Book or Story telling), and in some of them the word \"Cipher\" literally means (Counting)-- (Numerical description)-- Example, Book 2 Samuel 24:10, Isaiah 33:18, and Jeremiah 52:25.\n\nIbrahim Al-Kadi concluded that the Arabic word \"sifr\", for the digit zero, developed into the European technical term for encryption.\n\nAs the decimal zero and its new mathematics spread from the Arabic world to Europe in the Middle Ages, words derived from \"sifr\" and \"zephyrus\" came to refer to calculation, as well as to privileged knowledge and secret codes. According to Ifrah, \"in thirteenth-century Paris, a 'worthless fellow' was called a , i.e., an 'arithmetical nothing'.\" Cipher was the European pronunciation of sifr, and cipher came to mean a message or communication not easily understood.\n\nIn non-technical usage, a \"(secret) code\" typically means a \"cipher\". Within technical discussions, however, the words \"code\" and \"cipher\" refer to two different concepts. Codes work at the level of meaning—that is, words or phrases are converted into something else and this chunking generally shortens the message.\n\nAn example of this is the Commercial Telegraph Code which was used to shorten long telegraph messages which resulted from entering into commercial contracts using exchanges of Telegrams.\n\nAnother example is given by whole word ciphers, which allow the user to replace an entire word with a symbol or character, much like the way Japanese utilize Kanji (Japanese) characters to supplement their language. ex \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" becomes \"The quick brown 狐 jumps 过 the lazy 狗\".\n\nCiphers, on the other hand, work at a lower level: the level of individual letters, small groups of letters, or, in modern schemes, individual bits and blocks of bits. Some systems used both codes and ciphers in one system, using superencipherment to increase the security. In some cases the terms codes and ciphers are also used synonymously to substitution and transposition.\n\nHistorically, cryptography was split into a dichotomy of codes and ciphers; and coding had its own terminology, analogous to that for ciphers: \"\"encoding\", \"codetext\", \"decoding\"\" and so on.\n\nHowever, codes have a variety of drawbacks, including susceptibility to cryptanalysis and the difficulty of managing a cumbersome codebook. Because of this, codes have fallen into disuse in modern cryptography, and ciphers are the dominant technique.\n\nThere are a variety of different types of encryption. Algorithms used earlier in the history of cryptography are substantially different from modern methods, and modern ciphers can be classified according to how they operate and whether they use one or two keys.\n\nHistorical pen and paper ciphers used in the past are sometimes known as classical ciphers. They include simple substitution ciphers (such as Rot 13) and transposition ciphers (such as a Rail Fence Cipher). For example, \"GOOD DOG\" can be encrypted as \"PLLX XLP\" where \"L\" substitutes for \"O\", \"P\" for \"G\", and \"X\" for \"D\" in the message. Transposition of the letters \"GOOD DOG\" can result in \"DGOGDOO\". These simple ciphers and examples are easy to crack, even without plaintext-ciphertext pairs.\n\nSimple ciphers were replaced by polyalphabetic substitution ciphers (such as the Vigenère) which changed the substitution alphabet for every letter. For example, \"GOOD DOG\" can be encrypted as \"PLSX TWF\" where \"L\", \"S\", and \"W\" substitute for \"O\". With even a small amount of known or estimated plaintext, simple polyalphabetic substitution ciphers and letter transposition ciphers designed for pen and paper encryption are easy to crack. It is possible to create a secure pen and paper cipher based on a one-time pad though, but the usual disadvantages of one-time pads apply.\n\nDuring the early twentieth century, electro-mechanical machines were invented to do encryption and decryption using transposition, polyalphabetic substitution, and a kind of \"additive\" substitution. In rotor machines, several rotor disks provided polyalphabetic substitution, while plug boards provided another substitution. Keys were easily changed by changing the rotor disks and the plugboard wires. Although these encryption methods were more complex than previous schemes and required machines to encrypt and decrypt, other machines such as the British Bombe were invented to crack these encryption methods.\n\nModern encryption methods can be divided by two criteria: by type of key used, and by type of input data.\n\nBy type of key used ciphers are divided into:\n\nIn a symmetric key algorithm (e.g., DES and AES), the sender and receiver must have a shared key set up in advance and kept secret from all other parties; the sender uses this key for encryption, and the receiver uses the same key for decryption. The Feistel cipher uses a combination of substitution and transposition techniques. Most block cipher algorithms are based on this structure. In an asymmetric key algorithm (e.g., RSA), there are two separate keys: a \"public key\" is published and enables any sender to perform encryption, while a \"private key\" is kept secret by the receiver and enables only him to perform correct decryption.\n\nCiphers can be distinguished into two types by the type of input data:\n\nIn a pure mathematical attack, (i.e., lacking any other information to help break a cipher) two factors above all count:\n\nSince the desired effect is computational difficulty, in theory one would choose an algorithm and desired difficulty level, thus decide the key length accordingly.\n\nAn example of this process can be found at Key Length which uses multiple reports to suggest that a symmetric cipher with 128 bits, an asymmetric cipher with 3072 bit keys, and an elliptic curve cipher with 512 bits, all have similar difficulty at present.\n\nClaude Shannon proved, using information theory considerations, that any theoretically unbreakable cipher must have keys which are at least as long as the plaintext, and used only once: one-time pad.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "324863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324863", "title": "Formalism (philosophy)", "text": "Formalism (philosophy)\n\nThe term formalism describes an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the arts, literature, or philosophy. A practitioner of formalism is called a formalist. A formalist, with respect to some discipline, holds that there is no transcendent meaning to that discipline other than the literal content created by a practitioner. For example, formalists within mathematics claim that mathematics is no more than the symbols written down by the mathematician, which is based on logic and a few elementary rules alone. This is as opposed to non-formalists, within that field, who hold that there are some things inherently true, and are not, necessarily, dependent on the symbols within mathematics so much as a greater truth. Formalists within a discipline are completely concerned with \"the rules of the game,\" as there is no other external truth that can be achieved beyond those given rules. In this sense, formalism lends itself well to disciplines based upon axiomatic systems.\n\nFormalism in religion means an emphasis on ritual and observance over their meanings. Within Christianity, the term legalism is a derogatory term that is loosely synonymous to religious formalism.\n\nFormalism is a school of thought in law and jurisprudence which assumes that the law is a system of rules that can determine the outcome of any case, without reference to external norms. For example, formalism animates the commonly heard criticism that \"judges should apply the law, not make it.\" To formalism's rival, legal realism, this criticism is incoherent, because legal realism assumes that, at least in difficult cases, all applications of the law will require that a judge refer to external (i.e. non-legal) sources, such as the judge's conception of justice, or commercial norms.\n\nIn general in the study of the arts and literature, \"formalism\" refers to the style of criticism that focuses on artistic or literary techniques in themselves, in separation from the work's social and historical context. \n\nGenerally speaking, formalism is the concept which everything necessary in a work of art is contained within it. The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, is not considered to be significant. Examples of formalist aestheticians are Clive Bell, Jerome Stolnitz, and Edward Bullough.\n\nIn contemporary discussions of literary theory, the school of criticism of I. A. Richards and his followers, traditionally the New Criticism, has sometimes been labelled 'formalist'. The formalist approach, in this sense, is a continuation of aspects of classical rhetoric. \n\nRussian formalism was a twentieth century school, based in Eastern Europe, with roots in linguistic studies and also theorising on fairy tales, in which content is taken as secondary since the tale 'is' the form, the princess 'is' the fairy-tale princess.\n\nIn modern poetry, \"Formalist poets\" may be considered as the opposite of writers of free verse. These are only labels, and rarely sum up matters satisfactorily. 'Formalism' in poetry represents an attachment to poetry that recognises and uses schemes of rhyme and rhythm to create poetic effects and to innovate. To distinguish it from archaic poetry the term 'neo-formalist' is sometimes used.\n\nSee for example:\n\nIn film studies, formalism is a trait in filmmaking, which overtly uses the language of film, such as editing, shot composition, camera movement, set design, etc., so as to emphasise graphical (as opposed to diegetic) qualities of the image. Strict formalism, condemned by realist film theorists such as André Bazin, has declined substantially in popular usage since the 1950s, though some more postmodern filmmakers reference it to suggest the artificiality of the film experience. \n\nExamples of formalist films may include Resnais's \"Last Year at Marienbad\" and Parajanov's \"The Color of Pomegranates\".\n\nFormalism can be applied to a set of notations and rules for manipulating them which yield results in agreement with experiment or other techniques of calculation. These rules and notations may or may not have a corresponding mathematical semantics. In the case no mathematical semantics exists, the calculations are often said to be \"purely formal\". See for example scientific formalism.\n\nIn the foundations of mathematics, formalism is associated with a certain rigorous mathematical method: see formal system. In common usage, \"a\" formalism means the out-turn of the effort towards formalisation of a given limited area. In other words, matters can be formally discussed once captured in a formal system, or commonly enough within something \"formalisable\" with claims to be one. Complete formalisation is in the domain of computer science.\n\nFormalism also more precisely refers to a certain school in the philosophy of mathematics, stressing axiomatic proofs through theorems, specifically associated with David Hilbert. In the philosophy of mathematics, therefore, a formalist is a person who belongs to the school of formalism, which is a certain mathematical-philosophical doctrine descending from Hilbert.\n\nIn economic anthropology, formalism is the theoretical perspective that the principles of neoclassical economics can be applied to our understanding of all human societies.\n\n"}

{"id": "12420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12420", "title": "Gödel's ontological proof", "text": "Gödel's ontological proof\n\nGödel's ontological proof is a formal argument by the mathematician Kurt Gödel (1906–1978) for God's existence. More precisely, it presupposes the notion of \"positive\" and \"negative\" properties, and proves the necessary existence of an object which each positive property, but no negative property, applies to.\n\nThe argument is in a line of development that goes back to Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109). St. Anselm's ontological argument, in its most succinct form, is as follows: \"God, by definition, is that for which no greater can be conceived. God exists in the understanding. If God exists in the understanding, we could imagine Him to be greater by existing in reality. Therefore, God must exist.\" A more elaborate version was given by Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716); this is the version that Gödel studied and attempted to clarify with his ontological argument.\n\nGödel left a fourteen-point outline of his philosophical beliefs in his papers. Points relevant to the ontological proof include\n\nThe first version of the ontological proof in Gödel's papers is dated \"around 1941\". Gödel is not known to have told anyone about his work on the proof until 1970, when he thought he was dying. In February, he allowed Dana Scott to copy out a version of the proof, which circulated privately. In August 1970, Gödel told Oskar Morgenstern that he was \"satisfied\" with the proof, but Morgenstern recorded in his diary entry for 29 August 1970, that Gödel would not publish because he was afraid that others might think \"that he actually believes in God, whereas he is only engaged in a logical investigation (that is, in showing that such a proof with classical assumptions (completeness, etc.) correspondingly axiomatized, is possible).\" Gödel died January 14, 1978. Another version, slightly different from Scott's, was found in his papers. It was finally published, together with Scott's version, in 1987.\n\nMorgenstern's diary is an important and usually reliable source for Gödel's later years, but the implication of the August 1970 diary entry—that Gödel did not believe in God—is not consistent with the other evidence. In letters to his mother, who was not a churchgoer and had raised Kurt and his brother as freethinkers, Gödel argued at length for a belief in an afterlife. He did the same in an interview with a skeptical Hao Wang, who said: \"I expressed my doubts as G spoke [...] Gödel smiled as he replied to my questions, obviously aware that his answers were not convincing me.\" Wang reports that Gödel's wife, Adele, two days after Gödel's death, told Wang that \"Gödel, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning.\" In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, Gödel described his religion as \"baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is \"theistic\", not pantheistic, following Leibniz rather than Spinoza.\"\n\nThe proof uses modal logic, which distinguishes between \"necessary\" truths and \"contingent\" truths. In the most common semantics for modal logic, many \"possible worlds\" are considered. A truth is \"necessary\" if it is true in all possible worlds. By contrast, a truth is \"contingent\" if it just happens to be the case. For instance, \"more than half of this planet is covered by water\" is a contingent truth, that relies upon which planet \"this planet\" is. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is false in another world, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some world (not necessarily our own) is called a \"possible\" truth.\n\nFurthermore, the proof uses higher-order (modal) logic because the definition of God employs an explicit quantification over properties.\n\nFirst, Gödel axiomatizes the notion of a \"positive property\": for each property \"φ\", either \"φ\" or its negation ¬\"φ\" must be positive, but not both (axiom 2). If a positive property \"φ\" implies a property \"ψ\" in each possible world, then \"ψ\" is positive, too (axiom 1). Gödel then argues that each positive property is \"possibly exemplified\", i.e. applies at least to some object in some world (theorem 1). Defining an object to be Godlike if it has all positive properties (definition 1), and requiring that property to be positive itself (axiom 3), Gödel shows that in \"some\" possible world a Godlike object exists (theorem 2), called \"God\" in the following. Gödel proceeds to prove that a Godlike object exists in \"every\" possible world.\n\nTo this end, he defines \"essences\": if \"x\" is an object in some world, then a property \"φ\" is said to be an essence of \"x\" if \"φ\"(\"x\") is true in that world and if \"φ\" necessarily entails all other properties that \"x\" has in that world (definition 2). Requiring positive properties being positive in every possible world (axiom 4), Gödel can show that Godlikeness is an essence of a Godlike object (theorem 3). Now, \"x\" is said to \"exist necessarily\" if, for every essence \"φ\" of \"x\", there is an element \"y\" with property \"φ\" in every possible world (definition 3). Axiom 5 requires necessary existence to be a positive property.\n\nHence, it must follow from Godlikeness. Moreover, Godlikeness is an essence of God, since it entails all positive properties, and any non-positive property is the negation of some positive property, so God cannot have any non-positive properties. Since necessary existence is also a positive property (axiom 5), it must be a property of every Godlike object, as every Godlike object has all the positive properties (definition 1). Since any Godlike object is necessarily existent, it follows that any Godlike object in one world is a Godlike object in all worlds, by the definition of necessary existence. Given the existence of a Godlike object in one world, proven above, we may conclude that there is a Godlike object in every possible world, as required (theorem 4). Besides axiom 1-5 and definition 1-3, a few other axioms from modal logic were tacitly used in the proof.\n\nFrom these hypotheses, it is also possible to prove that there is only one God in each world by Leibniz's law, the identity of indiscernibles: two or more objects are identical (the same) if they have all their properties in common, and so, there would only be one object in each world that possesses property G. Gödel did not attempt to do so however, as he purposely limited his proof to the issue of existence, rather than uniqueness.\n\nformula_1\n\nThere is an ongoing open-source effort to formalize Gödel's proof to a level that is suitable for automated theorem proving or at least computer verification via proof assistants. The effort made headlines in German newspapers. According to the authors of this effort, they were inspired by Melvin Fitting's book.\n\nMost criticism of Gödel's proof is aimed at its axioms: As with any proof in any logical system, if the axioms the proof depends on are doubted, then the conclusions can be doubted. This is particularly applicable to Gödel's proof – because it rests on five axioms, some of which are questionable. A proof does not necessitate that the conclusion be correct, but rather that by accepting the axioms, the conclusion follows logically.\n\nMany philosophers have questioned the axioms. The first layer of attack is simply that there are no arguments presented that give reasons why the axioms are true. A second layer is that these particular axioms lead to unwelcome conclusions. This line of thought was argued by Jordan Howard Sobel, showing that if the axioms are accepted, they lead to a \"modal collapse\" where every statement that is true is necessarily true, i.e. the sets of necessary, of contingent, and of possible truths all coincide (provided there are accessible worlds at all). According to Koons, Sobel suggested that Gödel might have welcomed modal collapse.\n\nThere are suggested amendments to the proof, presented by C. Anthony Anderson, but argued to be refutable by Anderson and Michael Gettings. Sobel's proof of modal collapse has been questioned by Robert Koons, but a counter-defence by Sobel has been given. In 2014, Christoph Benzmüller and Bruno Woltzenlogel-Paleo gave a computer-checked proof of modal collapse. In the same paper, they suspected Gödel's original version of the axioms to be inconsistent; in 2016, they gave a computer proof that this version implies formula_2, i.e. is inconsistent in every modal logic with a reflexive or symmetric accessibility relation.\n\nGödel's proof has also been questioned by Graham Oppy, asking whether lots of other almost-gods would also be \"proven\" by Gödel's axioms. This counter-argument has been questioned by Gettings, who agrees that the axioms might be questioned, but disagrees that Oppy's particular counter-example can be shown from Gödel's axioms.\n\nReligious scholars such as Fr. Robert J. Spitzer have accepted Gödel's proof, calling it \"an improvement over the Anselmian Ontological Argument (which does not work).\"\n\nThere are, however, many more criticisms, most focusing on the philosophically interesting question of whether these axioms \"must\" be rejected to avoid odd conclusions. The broader criticism is that even if the axioms cannot be shown to be false, that does not mean that they are true. Hilbert's famous remark about interchangeability of the primitives' names applies to those in Gödel's ontological axioms (\"\"positive\", \"god-like\", \"essence\") as well as to those in Hilbert's geometry axioms (\"point\", \"line\", \"plane\"\"). According to André Fuhrmann (2005) it remains to show that the dazzling notion prescribed by traditions and often believed to be essentially mysterious satisfies Gödel's axioms. This is not a mathematical, but merely a theological task. It is this task which decides which religion's god has been proven to exist.\n\nA humorous variant of Gödel's ontological proof is mentioned in Quentin Canterel's novel \"The Jolly Coroner\".\nThe proof is also mentioned in the TV series \"Hand of God\".\n\n\n\n"}

The constant \"k\" is called the degree of homogeneity.\n\nMore generally, if is a function between two vector spaces over a field \"F\", and \"k\" is an integer, then \"ƒ\" is said to be homogeneous of degree \"k\" if\n\nfor all nonzero and . When the vector spaces involved are over the real numbers, a slightly less general form of homogeneity is often used, requiring only that () hold for all α > 0.\n\nHomogeneous functions can also be defined for vector spaces with the origin deleted, a fact that is used in the definition of sheaves on projective space in algebraic geometry. More generally, if \"S\" ⊂ \"V\" is any subset that is invariant under scalar multiplication by elements of the field (a \"cone\"), then a homogeneous function from \"S\" to \"W\" can still be defined by ().\n\nThe function formula_4 is homogeneous of degree 2:<br>\nformula_5<br>\nFor example, suppose x = 2, y = 4 and t = 5.

It follows that the \"n\"-th differential of a function between two Banach spaces \"X\" and \"Y\" is homogeneous of degree \"n\".\n\nMonomials in \"n\" variables define homogeneous functions .

For example,\nis a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5. Homogeneous polynomials also define homogeneous functions.\n\nGiven a homogeneous polynomial of degree \"k\", it is possible to get a homogeneous function of degree 1 by raising to the power 1/\"k\". So for example, for every \"k\" the following function is homogeneous of degree 1:\n\nFor every set of weights formula_14, the following functions are homogeneous of degree 1:\n\nA multilinear function from the \"n\"-th Cartesian product of \"V\" with itself to the underlying field \"F\" gives rise to a homogeneous function by evaluating on the diagonal:\nThe resulting function \"ƒ\" is a polynomial on the vector space \"V\".\n\nConversely, if \"F\" has characteristic zero, then given a homogeneous polynomial \"ƒ\" of degree \"n\" on \"V\", the polarization of \"ƒ\" is a multilinear function on the \"n\"-th Cartesian product of \"V\". The polarization is defined by:\nformula_18\nThese two constructions, one of a homogeneous polynomial from a multilinear form and the other of a multilinear form from a homogeneous polynomial, are mutually inverse to one another. In finite dimensions, they establish an isomorphism of graded vector spaces from the symmetric algebra of \"V\" to the algebra of homogeneous polynomials on \"V\".\n\nRational functions formed as the ratio of two \"homogeneous\" polynomials are homogeneous functions off of the affine cone cut out by the zero locus of the denominator. Thus, if \"f\" is homogeneous of degree \"m\" and \"g\" is homogeneous of degree \"n\", then \"f\"/\"g\" is homogeneous of degree \"m\" − \"n\" away from the zeros of \"g\".\n\nThe natural logarithm formula_19 scales additively and so is not homogeneous.\n\nThis can be demonstrated with the following examples: formula_20, formula_21, and formula_22. This is because there is no formula_2 such that formula_24.\n\nAffine functions (the function formula_25 is an example) do not scale multiplicatively.\n\nIn the special case of vector spaces over the real numbers, the notion of positive homogeneity often plays a more important role than homogeneity in the above sense. A function is positively homogeneous of degree \"k\" if\n\nfor all . Here \"k\" can be any real number. A (nonzero) continuous function homogeneous of degree \"k\" on R \\ {0} extends continuously to R if and only if .\n\nPositively homogeneous functions are characterized by Euler's homogeneous function theorem. Suppose that the function is continuously differentiable. Then \"ƒ\" is positively homogeneous of degree \"k\" if and only if\n\nThis result follows at once by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to α, applying the chain rule, and choosing to be 1. The converse holds by integrating. Specifically, let\nformula_28.\nSince formula_29,\nThus, formula_31.\nThis implies formula_32.\nTherefore, formula_33: \"ƒ\" is positively homogeneous of degree \"k\".\n\nAs a consequence, suppose that is differentiable and homogeneous of degree \"k\". Then its first-order partial derivatives formula_34 are homogeneous of degree \"k\" − 1. The result follows from Euler's theorem by commuting the operator formula_35 with the partial derivative.\n\nOne can specialise the theorem to the case of a function of a single real variable (\"n\" = 1), in which case the function satisfies the ordinary differential equation\nThis equation may be solved using an integrating factor approach, with solution formula_37, where formula_38.\n\nA continuous function ƒ on R is homogeneous of degree \"k\" if and only if\nfor all compactly supported test functions formula_40; and nonzero real \"t\".

{"id": "45199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45199", "title": "Inverse element", "text": "Inverse element\n\nIn abstract algebra, the idea of an inverse element generalises concepts of a negation (sign reversal) in relation to addition, and a reciprocal in relation to multiplication. The intuition is of an element that can 'undo' the effect of combination with another given element. While the precise definition of an inverse element varies depending on the algebraic structure involved, these definitions coincide in a group.\n\nThe word 'inverse' is derived from that means 'turned upside down', 'overturned'.\n\nLet formula_1 be a set closed under a binary operation formula_2 (i.e., a magma). If formula_3 is an identity element of formula_4 (i.e., \"S\" is a unital magma) and formula_5, then formula_6 is called a left inverse of formula_7 and formula_7 is called a right inverse of formula_6. If an element formula_10 is both a left inverse and a right inverse of formula_11, then formula_10 is called a two-sided inverse, or simply an inverse, of formula_11. An element with a two-sided inverse in formula_1 is called invertible in formula_1. An element with an inverse element only on one side is left invertible, resp. right invertible. A unital magma in which all elements are invertible is called a loop. A loop whose binary operation satisfies the associative law is a group.\n\nJust like formula_4 can have several left identities or several right identities, it is possible for an element to have several left inverses or several right inverses (but note that their definition above uses a \"two-sided\" identity formula_3). It can even have several left inverses \"and\" several right inverses.\n\nIf the operation formula_2 is associative then if an element has both a left inverse and a right inverse, they are equal. In other words, in a monoid (an associative unital magma) every element has at most one inverse (as defined in this section). In a monoid, the set of (left and right) invertible elements is a group, called the group of units of formula_1, and denoted by formula_20 or \"H\".\n\nA left-invertible element is left-cancellative, and analogously for right and two-sided.\n\nThe definition in the previous section generalizes the notion of inverse in group relative to the notion of identity. It's also possible, albeit less obvious, to generalize the notion of an inverse by dropping the identity element but keeping associativity, i.e., in a semigroup.\n\nIn a semigroup \"S\" an element \"x\" is called (von Neumann) regular if there exists some element \"z\" in \"S\" such that \"xzx\" = \"x\"; \"z\" is sometimes called a pseudoinverse. An element \"y\" is called (simply) an inverse of \"x\" if \"xyx\" = \"x\" and \"y\" = \"yxy\". Every regular element has at least one inverse: if \"x\" = \"xzx\" then it is easy to verify that \"y\" = \"zxz\" is an inverse of \"x\" as defined in this section. Another easy to prove fact: if \"y\" is an inverse of \"x\" then \"e\" = \"xy\" and \"f\" = \"yx\" are idempotents, that is \"ee\" = \"e\" and \"ff\" = \"f\". Thus, every pair of (mutually) inverse elements gives rise to two idempotents, and \"ex\" = \"xf\" = \"x\", \"ye\" = \"fy\" = \"y\", and \"e\" acts as a left identity on \"x\", while \"f\" acts a right identity, and the left/right roles are reversed for \"y\". This simple observation can be generalized using Green's relations: every idempotent \"e\" in an arbitrary semigroup is a left identity for \"R\" and right identity for \"L\". An intuitive description of this fact is that every pair of mutually inverse elements produces a local left identity, and respectively, a local right identity.\n\nIn a monoid, the notion of inverse as defined in the previous section is strictly narrower than the definition given in this section. Only elements in the Green class \"H\" have an inverse from the unital magma perspective, whereas for any idempotent \"e\", the elements of \"H\" have an inverse as defined in this section. Under this more general definition, inverses need not be unique (or exist) in an arbitrary semigroup or monoid. If all elements are regular, then the semigroup (or monoid) is called regular, and every element has at least one inverse. If every element has exactly one inverse as defined in this section, then the semigroup is called an inverse semigroup. Finally, an inverse semigroup with only one idempotent is a group. An inverse semigroup may have an absorbing element 0 because 000 = 0, whereas a group may not.\n\nOutside semigroup theory, a unique inverse as defined in this section is sometimes called a quasi-inverse. This is generally justified because in most applications (e.g., all examples in this article) associativity holds, which makes this notion a generalization of the left/right inverse relative to an identity.\n\nA natural generalization of the inverse semigroup is to define an (arbitrary) unary operation ° such that (\"a\"°)° = \"a\" for all \"a\" in \"S\"; this endows \"S\" with a type 2,1 algebra. A semigroup endowed with such an operation is called a \"U\"-semigroup. Although it may seem that \"a\"° will be the inverse of \"a\", this is not necessarily the case. In order to obtain interesting notion(s), the unary operation must somehow interact with the semigroup operation. Two classes of \"U\"-semigroups have been studied:\n\n\nClearly a group is both an \"I\"-semigroup and a *-semigroup. A class of semigroups important in semigroup theory are completely regular semigroups; these are \"I\"-semigroups in which one additionally has \"aa\"° = \"a\"°\"a\"; in other words every element has commuting pseudoinverse \"a\"°. There are few concrete examples of such semigroups however; most are completely simple semigroups. In contrast, a subclass of *-semigroups, the *-regular semigroups (in the sense of Drazin), yield one of best known examples of a (unique) pseudoinverse, the Moore–Penrose inverse. In this case however the involution \"a\"* is not the pseudoinverse. Rather, the pseudoinverse of \"x\" is the unique element \"y\" such that \"xyx\" = \"x\", \"yxy\" = \"y\", (\"xy\")* = \"xy\", (\"yx\")* = \"yx\". Since *-regular semigroups generalize inverse semigroups, the unique element defined this way in a *-regular semigroup is called the generalized inverse or Penrose–Moore inverse.\n\nAll examples in this section involve associative operators, thus we shall use the terms left/right inverse for the unital magma-based definition, and quasi-inverse for its more general version.\n\nEvery real number formula_10 has an additive inverse (i.e., an inverse with respect to addition) given by formula_22. Every nonzero real number formula_10 has a multiplicative inverse (i.e., an inverse with respect to multiplication) given by formula_24 (or formula_25). By contrast, zero has no multiplicative inverse, but it has a unique quasi-inverse, \"formula_26\" itself.\n\nA function formula_27 is the left (resp. right) inverse of a function formula_28 (for function composition), if and only if formula_29 (resp. formula_30) is the identity function on the domain (resp. codomain) of formula_28. The inverse of a function formula_28 is often written formula_33, but this notation is sometimes ambiguous. Only bijections have two-sided inverses, but \"any\" function has a quasi-inverse, i.e., the full transformation monoid is regular. The monoid of partial functions is also regular, whereas the monoid of injective partial transformations is the prototypical inverse semigroup.\n\nThe lower and upper adjoints in a (monotone) Galois connection, \"L\" and \"G\" are quasi-inverses of each other, i.e. \"LGL\" = \"L\" and \"GLG\" = \"G\" and one uniquely determines the other. They are not left or right inverses of each other however.\n\nA square matrix formula_34 with entries in a field formula_35 is invertible (in the set of all square matrices of the same size, under matrix multiplication) if and only if its determinant is different from zero. If the determinant of formula_34 is zero, it is impossible for it to have a one-sided inverse; therefore a left inverse or right inverse implies the existence of the other one. See invertible matrix for more.\n\nMore generally, a square matrix over a commutative ring formula_37 is invertible if and only if its determinant is invertible in formula_37.\n\nNon-square matrices of full rank have several one-sided inverses:\n\nThe left inverse can be used to determine the least norm solution of formula_43, which is also the least squares formula for regression and is given by formula_44\n\nNo rank deficient matrix has any (even one-sided) inverse. However, the Moore–Penrose inverse exists for all matrices, and coincides with the left or right (or true) inverse when it exists.\n\nAs an example of matrix inverses, consider:\n\nSo, as \"m\" < \"n\", we have a right inverse, formula_46 By components it is computed as\n\nThe left inverse doesn't exist, because\n\nwhich is a singular matrix, and cannot be inverted.\n\n\n"}

Thomas Penyngton Kirkman in 1850 as Query VI in \"The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary\" (pg.48). The problem states:\nFifteen young ladies in a school walk out three abreast for seven days in succession: it is required to arrange them daily so that no two shall walk twice abreast.\nIf the girls are numbered from 01 to 15, the following arrangement is one solution:\n\nA solution to this problem is an example of a \"Kirkman triple system\", which is a Steiner triple system having a \"parallelism\", that is, a partition of the blocks of the triple system into parallel classes which are themselves partitions of the points into disjoint blocks.\n\nThere are seven non-isomorphic solutions to the schoolgirl problem. Two of these can be visualized as relations between a tetrahedron and its vertices, edges, and faces.\nAn approach using projective geometry of three dimensions over GF(2) is given below.\n\nThe first solution was published by Arthur Cayley. This was shortly followed by Kirkman's own solution which was given as a special case of his considerations on combinatorial arrangements published three years prior. J. J. Sylvester also investigated the problem and ended up declaring that Kirkman stole the idea from him. The puzzle appeared in several recreational mathematics books at the turn of the century by Lucas, Rouse Ball, Ahrens, and Dudeney.\n\nKirkman often complained about the fact that his substantial paper was totally eclipsed by the popular interest in the schoolgirl problem.\n\nIn 1910 the problem was addressed using Galois geometry by George Conwell\n\nThe Galois field GF(2) with two elements is used with four homogeneous coordinates to form PG(3,2) which has 15 points, 3 points to a line, 7 points and 7 lines in a plane. A plane can be considered a complete quadrilateral together with the line through its diagonal points. Each point is on 7 lines, and there are 35 lines in all.\n\nThe lines of PG(3,2) are identified by their Plücker coordinates in PG(5,2) with 63 points, 35 of which represent lines of PG(3,2). These 35 points form the surface \"S\" known as the Klein quadric. For each of the 28 points off \"S\" there are 6 lines through it which do not intersect \"S\".\n\nAs there are seven days in a week, the heptad is an important part of the solution:\nA heptad is determined by any two of its points. Each of the 28 points off \"S\" lies in two heptads. There are 8 heptads. The projective linear group PGL(3,2) is isomorphic the alternating group on the 8 heptads.\n\nThe schoolgirl problem consists in finding seven lines in the 5-space which do not intersect and such that any two lines always have a heptad in common.\n\nA partition of points into lines is called a ', and the partition of the spreads of a geometry is called a '. When Hirschfeld considered the problem in his \"Finite Projective Spaces of Three Dimensions\" (1985), he noted that a solution corresponds to a packing of PG(3,2), essentially as described by Conwell above.\n\nThe problem can be generalized to formula_1 girls, where formula_1 must be an odd multiple of 3 (that is formula_3), walking in triplets for formula_4 days, with the requirement, again, that no pair of girls walk in the same row twice. The solution to this generalisation is a Steiner triple system, an S(2, 3, 6\"t\" + 3) with parallelism (that is, one in which each of the 6\"t\" + 3 elements occurs exactly once in each block of 3-element sets), known as a \"Kirkman triple system\". It is this generalization of the problem that Kirkman discussed first, while the famous special case formula_5 was only proposed later. A complete solution to the general case was published by D. K. Ray-Chaudhuri and R. M. Wilson in 1968, though it had already been solved by Lu Jiaxi () in 1965, but had not been published at that time.\n\nMany variations of the basic problem can be considered. Alan Hartman solves a problem of this type with the requirement that no trio walks in a row of four more than once using Steiner quadruple systems.\n\nMore recently a similar problem known as the Social Golfer Problem has gained interest that deals with 20 golfers who want to get to play with different people each day in groups of 4.\n\nAs this is a regrouping strategy where all groups are orthogonal, this process within the problem of organising a large group into smaller groups where no two people share the same group twice can be referred to as orthogonal regrouping. However, this term is currently not commonly used and evidence suggests that there is no common name for the process.\n\nThe Oberwolfach problem, of decomposing a complete graph into edge-disjoint copies of a given 2-regular graph, also generalizes Kirkman's schoolgirl problem. Kirkman's problem is the special case of the Oberwolfach problem in which the 2-regular graph consists of five disjoint triangles.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37165960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37165960", "title": "Matroid representation", "text": "Matroid representation\n\nIn the mathematical theory of matroids, a matroid representation is a family of vectors whose linear independence relation is the same as that of a given matroid. Matroid representations are analogous to group representations; both types of representation provide abstract algebraic structures (matroids and groups respectively) with concrete descriptions in terms of linear algebra.\n\nA linear matroid is a matroid that has a representation, and an \"F\"-linear matroid (for a field \"F\") is a matroid that has a representation using a vector space over \"F\". Matroid representation theory studies the existence of representations and the properties of linear matroids.\n\nA (finite) matroid formula_1 is defined by a finite set formula_2 (the elements of the matroid) and a family formula_3 of the subsets of formula_2, called the independent sets of the matroid. It is required to satisfy the properties that every subset of an independent set is itself independent, and that if one independent set formula_5 is larger than a second independent set formula_6 then there exists an element formula_7 that can be added to formula_6 to form a larger independent set. One of the key motivating examples in the formulation of matroids was the notion of linear independence of vectors in a vector space: if formula_2 is a finite set or multiset of vectors, and formula_3 is the family of linearly independent subsets of formula_2, then formula_1 is a matroid.\n\nMore generally, if formula_1 is any matroid, then a representation of formula_1 may be defined as a function formula_15 that maps formula_2 to a vector space formula_17, with the property that a subset formula_5 of formula_2 is independent if and only if formula_20 is linearly independent. A matroid with a representation is called a linear matroid, and if formula_17 is a vector space over field \"F\" then the matroid is called an \"F\"-linear matroid. Thus, the linear matroids are exactly the matroids that are isomorphic to the matroids defined from sets or multisets of vectors. The function formula_15 will be one-to-one if and only if the underlying matroid is simple (having no two-element dependent sets).\nMatroid representations may also be described more concretely using matrices over a field \"F\", with one column per matroid element and with a set of elements being independent in the matroid if and only if the corresponding set of matrix columns is linearly independent.\nThe rank function of a linear matroid is given by the matrix rank of submatrices of this matrix, or equivalently by the dimension of the linear span of subsets of vectors.\n\nNot every matroid is linear; the eight-element Vámos matroid is one of the smallest matroids that is unrepresentable over all fields. If a matroid is linear, it may be representable over some but not all fields.\nFor instance, the nine-element rank-three matroid defined by the Perles configuration is representable over the real numbers but not over the rational numbers.\n\nBinary matroids are the matroids that can be represented over the finite field GF(2); they are exactly the matroids that do not have the uniform matroid formula_23 as a minor. The unimodular or regular matroids are the matroids that can be represented over all fields; they can be characterized as the matroids that have none of formula_23, the Fano plane (a binary matroid with seven elements), or the dual matroid of the Fano plane as minors. Alternatively, a matroid is regular if and only if it can be represented by a totally unimodular matrix.\n\nRota's conjecture states that, for every finite field \"F\", the \"F\"-linear matroids can be characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors, similar to the characterizations described above for the binary and regular matroids. As of 2012, it has been proven only for fields of four or fewer elements. For infinite fields (such as the field of the real numbers) no such characterization is possible.\n\nFor every algebraic number field and every finite field \"F\" there is a matroid \"M\" for which \"F\" is the minimal subfield of its algebraic closure over which \"M\" can be represented: \"M\" can be taken to be of rank 3.\n\nThe characteristic set of a linear matroid is defined as the set of characteristics of the fields over which it is linear. For every prime number \"p\" there exist infinitely many matroids whose characteristic set is the singleton set {\"p\"}, and for every finite set of prime numbers there exists a matroid whose characteristic set is the given finite set.\n\nIf the characteristic set of a matroid is infinite, it contains zero; and if it contains zero then it contains all but finitely many primes. Hence the only possible characteristic sets are finite sets not containing zero, and cofinite sets containing zero. Indeed, all such sets do occur.\n\nA uniform matroid formula_25 has formula_26 elements, and its independent sets consist of all subsets of up to formula_27 of the elements. Uniform matroids may be represented by sets of vectors in general position in an formula_27-dimensional vector space. The field of representation must be large enough for there to exist formula_26 vectors in general position in this vector space, so uniform matroids are \"F\"-linear for all but finitely many fields \"F\". The same is true for the partition matroids, the direct sums of the uniform matroids, as the direct sum of any two \"F\"-linear matroids is itself \"F\"-linear.\n\nA graphic matroid is the matroid defined from the edges of an undirected graph by defining a set of edges to be independent if and only if it does not contain a cycle. Every graphic matroid is regular, and thus is \"F\"-linear for every field \"F\".\n\nThe rigidity matroids describe the degrees of freedom of mechanical linkages formed by rigid bars connected at their ends by flexible hinges. A linkage of this type may be described as a graph, with an edge for each bar and a vertex for each hinge, and for one-dimensional linkages the rigidity matroids are exactly the graphic matroids. Higher-dimensional rigidity matroids may be defined using matrices of real numbers with a structure similar to that of the incidence matrix of the underlying graph, and hence are formula_30-linear.\n\nLike uniform matroids and partition matroids, the gammoids, matroids representing reachability in directed graphs, are linear over every sufficiently large field. More specifically, a gammoid with formula_26 elements may be represented over every field that has at least formula_32 elements.\n\nThe algebraic matroids are matroids defined from sets of elements of a field extension using the notion of algebraic independence. Every linear matroid is algebraic, and for fields of characteristic zero (such as the real numbers) linear and algebraic matroids coincide, but for other fields there may exist algebraic matroids that are not linear.\n"}
{"id": "2580834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2580834", "title": "Motor variable", "text": "Motor variable\n\nIn mathematics, a function of a motor variable is a function with arguments and values in the split-complex number plane, much as functions of a complex variable involve ordinary complex numbers. William Kingdon Clifford coined the term motor for a kinematic operator in his \"Preliminary Sketch of Biquaternions\" (1873). He used split-complex numbers for scalars in his split-biquaternions. \"Motor variable\" is used here in place of \"split-complex variable\" for euphony and tradition.\n\nFor example,\nFunctions of a motor variable provide a context to extend real analysis and provide compact representation of mappings of the plane. However, the theory falls well short of function theory on the ordinary complex plane. Nevertheless, some of the aspects of conventional complex analysis have an interpretation given with motor variables.\n\nLet D = formula_2, the split-complex plane. The following exemplar functions \"f\" have domain and range in D:\n\nThe action of a hyperbolic versor formula_3 is combined with translation to produce the affine transformation\n\nThe squaring function has no analogy in ordinary complex arithmetic. Let\nThe result is that the four quadrants are mapped into one, the identity component:\n\nNote that formula_8 forms the unit hyperbola formula_9. Thus the \nreciprocation\ninvolves the hyperbola as curve of reference as opposed to the circle in C.\n\nOn the extended complex plane one has the class of functions called Möbius transformations:\nUsing the concept of a projective line over a ring, the projective line P(D) is formed and acted on by the group of homographies GL(2,D). The construction uses homogeneous coordinates with split-complex number components.\n\nOn the ordinary complex plane, the Cayley transform carries the upper half-plane to the unit disk, thus bounding it. A mapping of the identity component U into a rectangle provides a comparable bounding action:\nwhere T = {z = x + jy : |y| < x < 1 or |y| < x − 1 when 1<x<2}.\n\nThe exponential function carries the whole plane \"D\" into \"U\":\nThus when \"x\" = \"b\"j, then e is a hyperbolic versor. For the general motor variable \"z\" = \"a\" + \"b\"j, one has\n\nIn the theory of functions of a motor variable special attention should be called to the square root and logarithm functions. In particular, the plane of split-complex numbers consists of four connected components and the set of singular points that have no inverse: the diagonals \"z\" = \"x\" ± \"x\" j, \"x\" ∈ R. The identity component, namely {\"z\" : \"x\" > |\"y\"| }, is the range of the squaring function and the exponential. Thus it is the domain of the square root and logarithm functions. The other three quadrants do not belong in the domain because square root and logarithm are defined as one-to-one inverses of the squaring function and the exponential function.\n\nGraphic description of the logarithm of D is given by Motter & Rosa in their article \"Hyperbolic Calculus\" (1998).\n\nThe Cauchy–Riemann equations that characterize holomorphic functions on a domain in the complex plane have an analogue for functions of a motor variable. An approach to D-holomorphic functions using a Wirtinger derivative was given by Motter & Rossa: \nThe function \"f\" = \"u\" + j \"v\" is called D-holomorphic when\nBy considering real and imaginary components, a D-holomorphic function satisfies\nThese equations were published in 1893 by Georg Scheffers, so they have been called \"Scheffers' conditions\"\n\nThe comparable approach in harmonic function theory can be viewed in a text by Peter Duren\nIt is apparent that the components \"u\" \nand \"v\" of a D-holomorphic function \"f\" satisfy the wave equation, associated with \nD'Alembert, whereas components of C-holomorphic functions satisfy Laplace's equation.\n\nAt the National University of La Plata in 1935, J.C. Vignaux, an expert in convergence of infinite series, contributed four articles on the motor variable to the university’s annual periodical. He is the sole author of the introductory one, and consulted with his department head A. Durañona y Vedia on the others. In \"Sobre las series de numeros complejos hiperbolicos\" he says (p. 123):\nHe then proceeds, for example, to generalize theorems due to Cauchy, Abel, Mertens, and Hardy to the domain of the motor variable.\n\nIn the primary article, cited below, he considers D-holomorphic functions, and the satisfaction of d’Alembert’s equation by their components. He calls a rectangle with sides parallel to the diagonals \"y\" = \"x\" and \"y\" = − \"x\", an \"isotropic rectangle\" since its sides are on isotropic lines.\nHe concludes his abstract with these words:\n\nVignaux completed his series with a six-page note on the approximation of D-holomorphic functions in a unit isotropic rectangle by Bernstein polynomials.While there are some typographical errors as well as a couple of technical stumbles in this series, Vignaux succeeded in laying out the main lines of the theory that lies between real and ordinary complex analysis. The text is especially impressive as an instructive document for students and teachers due to its exemplary development from elements. Furthermore, the entire excursion is rooted in \"its relation to Émile Borel’s geometry\" so as to underwrite its motivation.\n\nIn 1892 Corrado Segre recalled the tessarine algebra as \"bicomplex numbers\". Naturally the subalgebra of real tessarines arose and came to be called the bireal numbers.\n\nIn 1946 U. Bencivenga published an essay on the dual numbers and the split-complex numbers where he used the term bireal number. He also described some of the function theory of the bireal variable. The essay was studied at University of British Columbia in 1949 when Geoffrey Fox wrote his master’s thesis \"Elementary function theory of a hypercomplex variable and the theory of conformal mapping in the hyperbolic plane\". On page 46 Fox reports \"Bencivenga has shown that a function of a bireal variable maps the hyperbolic plane into itself in such a manner that, at those points for which the derivative of a function exists and does not vanish, hyperbolic angles are preserved in the mapping\".\n\nG. Fox proceeds to provide the polar decomposition of a bireal variable and discusses hyperbolic orthogonality. Starting from a different definition he proves on page 57\nFox focuses on \"bilinear transformations\" formula_18, where formula_19 are bireal constants. To cope with singularity he augments the plane with a single point at infinity (page 73).\n\nAmong his novel contributions to function theory is the concept of an \"interlocked system\". Fox shows that for a bireal \"k\" satisfying \nthe hyperbolas \ndo not intersect (form an interlocked system). He then shows that this property is preserved by bilinear transformations of a bireal variable.\n\nTwo staples of introductory algebra include factorization of polynomials and the fundamental theorem of algebra. With the adoption of motor variables the traditional expectations are countered. The reason is that (D, +, × ) does \"not\" form a unique factorization domain. Substitute structures for the motor plane were provided by Poodiack and LeClair in 2009. They prove three versions of the fundamental theorem of algebra where a polynomial of degree \"n\" has \"n\" roots counting multiplicity. To provide an appropriate concept for multiplicity, they construct a matrix which contains all the roots of a polynomial. Furthermore, their method allows derivation of a similar theorem for polynomials with tessarine coefficients. The article in The College Mathematics Journal uses the term \"perplex number\" for a motor variable, and the term \"hyperbolic number\" for a tessarine. A basic example of the non-unique factorization is\nexhibiting the set {1, −1, j, −j } of four roots to the second degree polynomial.\nAnother example is\nIn general, a quadratic polynomial with two real roots can be factored in two ways as follows:\n\nThe multiplicative inverse function is so important that extreme measures are taken to include it in the mappings of differential geometry. For instance, the complex plane is rolled up to the Riemann sphere for ordinary complex arithmetic. For split-complex arithmetic a hyperboloid is used instead of a sphere: formula_23 As with the Riemann sphere, the method is stereographic projection from \"P\" = (0, 0, 1) through \"z\" = (\"x\", \"y\", 0) to the hyperboloid. The line \"L\" = \"Pz\" is parametrized by \"s\" in formula_24 so that it passes \"P\" when \"s\" is zero and \"z\" when \"s\" is one.\n\nFrom \"H\" ∩ \"L\" it follows that\nformula_25\n\nIf \"z\" is on the null cone, then \"s\" = 2 and (2\"x\", ±2\"x\", – 1) is on \"H\", the opposite points (2\"x\", ±2\"x\", 1) make up the light cone at infinity that is the image of the null cone under inversion.\n\nNote that for \"z\" with formula_26 \"s\" is negative. The implication is that the back-ray through \"P\" to \"z\" provides the point on \"H\". These points \"z\" are above and below the hyperbola conjugate to the unit hyperbola.\n\nThe compactification must be completed in PR with homogeneous coordinates (\"w, x, y, z\") where \"w\" = 1 specifies the affine space (\"x, y, z\") used so far. Hyperboloid \"H\" is absorbed into the projective conic formula_27 which is a compact space.\n\nWalter Benz performed the compactification by using a mapping due to Hans Beck. Isaak Yaglom illustrated a two-step compactification as above, but with the split-complex plane tangent to the hyperboloid. In 2015 Emanuello & Nolder performed the compactification by first embedding the motor plane into a torus, and then making it projective by identifying antipodal points.\n\n"}

Both Fuller and the Coxes were illiterate. The Coxes owned 16 slaves, and appeared to value Fuller the most; he expressed gratitude for not being sold.\n\nStories of his abilities abounded through the Eastern seaboard. His skill was even used as proof that enslaved Blacks were equal to whites in intelligence, which fueled some pro-abolitionist discussion.\n\nWhen Fuller was about 70 years old, William Hartshorne and Samuel Coates of Pennsylvania were in Alexandria and, having heard of Fuller's powers, sent for him. They asked him two questions which satisfied their curiosity.\n\nFirst, when they asked him how many seconds there were in a year and a half, he answered in about two minutes, 47,304,000. Second, when they asked how many seconds a man has lived who is 70 years, 17 days and 12 hours old, he answered in a minute and a half 2,210,500,800. One of the men was working out the problems on paper, and informed Fuller that he was wrong, because the answer was much smaller. Fuller hastily replied, \"'Top, massa, you forget de leap year.\" When the leap year was added in, the sums matched.\n\nDespite Fuller's perfect answers, it appeared to Hartshorne and Coates that his mental abilities must have once been greater. They wrote:\n\nHe was gray-headed, and exhibited several other marks of the weakness of old age. He had worked hard upon a farm during the whole of life but had never been intemperate in the use of spirituous liquors. He spoke with great respect of his mistress, and mentioned in a particular manner his obligations to her for refusing to sell him, which she had been tempted to by offers of large sums of money from several persons.\n\nOne of the gentlemen, Mr. Coates, having remarked in his presence that it was a pity he had not an education equal to his genius, he said, \"No, Massa, it is best I had no learning, for many learned men be great fools.\"\n"}

Because a vertical line has infinite slope, a function whose graph has a vertical tangent is not differentiable at the point of tangency.\n\nA function ƒ has a vertical tangent at \"x\" = \"a\" if the difference quotient used to define the derivative has infinite limit:\n\nThe first case corresponds to an upward-sloping vertical tangent, and the second case to a downward-sloping vertical tangent. Informally speaking, the graph of ƒ has a vertical tangent at \"x\" = \"a\" if the derivative of ƒ at \"a\" is either positive or negative infinity.\n\nFor a continuous function, it is often possible to detect a vertical tangent by taking the limit of the derivative. If\n\nthen ƒ must have an upward-sloping vertical tangent at \"x\" = \"a\". Similarly, if\n\nthen ƒ must have a downward-sloping vertical tangent at \"x\" = \"a\". In these situations, the vertical tangent to ƒ appears as a vertical asymptote on the graph of the derivative.\n\nClosely related to vertical tangents are vertical cusps. This occurs when the one-sided derivatives are both infinite, but one is positive and the other is negative. For example, if\n\nthen the graph of ƒ will have a vertical cusp that slopes up on the left side and down on the right side.\n\nAs with vertical tangents, vertical cusps can sometimes be detected for a continuous function by examining the limit of the derivative. For example, if \nthen the graph of ƒ will have a vertical cusp that slopes down on the left side and up on the right side. This corresponds to a vertical asymptote on the graph of the derivative that goes to formula_6 on the left and formula_7 on the right.\n\nThe function\nhas a vertical tangent at \"x\" = 0, since it is continuous and\nSimilarly, the function\nhas a vertical cusp at \"x\" = 0, since it is continuous,\nand\n\nVertical Tangents and Cusps.
