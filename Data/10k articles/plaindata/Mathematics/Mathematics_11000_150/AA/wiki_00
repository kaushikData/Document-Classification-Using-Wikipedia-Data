These are also the three discrete distributions among the six members of the natural exponential family with quadratic variance functions (NEF–QVF). \n\nMore general distributions can be defined by fixing some initial values of \"p\" and applying the recursion to define subsequent values. This can be of use in fitting distributions to empirical data. However, some further well-known distributions are available if the recursion above need only hold for a restricted range of values of \"k\": for example the logarithmic distribution and the discrete uniform distribution.\n\nThe (\"a\", \"b\", 0) class of distributions has important applications in actuarial science in the context of loss models.\n\nSundt proved that only the binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution and the negative binomial distribution belong to this class of distributions, with each distribution being represented by a different sign of \"a\". Furthermore, it was shown by Fackler that there is a universal formula for all three distributions, called the (united) Panjer distribution.\n\nThe more usual parameters of these distributions are determined by both \"a\" and \"b\". The properties of these distributions in relation to the present class of distributions are summarised in the following table. Note that formula_5 denotes the probability generating function.\n\nNote that the Panjer distribution reduces to the Poisson distribution in the limit case formula_6; it coincides with the negative binomial distribution for positive, finite real numbers formula_7, and it equals the binomial distribution for negative integers formula_8.\n\nAn easy way to quickly determine whether a given sample was taken from a distribution from the (\"a\",\"b\",0) class is by graphing the ratio of two consecutive observed data (multiplied by a constant) against the \"x\"-axis.\n\nBy multiplying both sides of the recursive formula by formula_9, you get\n\nwhich shows that the left side is obviously a linear function of formula_9. When using a sample of formula_12 data, an approximation of the formula_13's need to be done. If formula_14 represents the number of observations having the value formula_9, then formula_16 is an unbiased estimator of the true formula_13.\n\nTherefore, if a linear trend is seen, then it can be assumed that the data is taken from an (\"a\",\"b\",0) distribution. Moreover, the slope of the function would be the parameter formula_3, while the ordinate at the origin would be formula_4.\n"}

Every matroid with a linear representation of this type may also be represented as an algebraic matroid, by choosing an indeterminate for each row of the matrix, and by using the matrix coefficients within each column to assign each matroid element a linear combination of these transcendentals.

It is a ternary (base 3) number system in which the digits have the values –1, 0, and 1, in contrast to the standard (unbalanced) ternary system, in which digits have values 0, 1 and 2. \nBalanced ternary can represent all integers without using a separate minus sign; the value of the leading non-zero digit of a number has the sign of the number itself.\n\nDifferent sources use different glyphs used to represent the three digits in balanced ternary. In this article, T (which resembles a ligature of the minus sign and 1) represents −1, while 0 and 1 represent themselves. Other conventions include using '−' and '+' to represent −1 and 1 respectively, or using Greek letter theta (Θ), which resembles a minus sign in a circle, to represent −1. In publications about the Setun computer, −1 is represented as overturned 1: \"\".\n\nBalanced ternary makes an early appearance in Michael Stifel's book \"Arithmetica Integra\" (1544). It also occurs in the works of Johannes Kepler and Léon Lalanne. Related signed-digit schemes in other bases have been discussed by John Colson, John Leslie, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, and possibly even the ancient Indian Vedas.\n\nIn the early days of computing, a few experimental Soviet computers were built with balanced ternary instead of binary, the most famous being the Setun, built by Nikolay Brusentsov and Sergei Sobolev. The notation has a number of computational advantages over traditional binary and ternary. Particularly, the plus–minus consistency cuts down the carry rate in multi-digit multiplication, and the rounding–truncation equivalence cuts down the carry rate in rounding on fractions. The one-digit multiplication table has no carries in balanced ternary, and the addition table has only two symmetric carries instead of three.\n\nIn the balanced ternary system the value of a digit \"n\" places left of the radix point is the product of the digit and 3. This is useful when converting between decimal and balanced ternary. In the following the strings denoting balanced ternary carry the suffix, \"bal3\". For instance,\n\nSimilarly, the first place to the right of the radix point holds 3 = 1/3, the second place holds 3 = 1/9, and so on. For instance,\n\nAn integer is divisible by three if and only if the digit in the units place is zero.\n\nWe may check the parity of a balanced ternary integer by checking the parity of the sum of all trits. This sum has the same parity as the integer itself.\n\nBalanced ternary can also be extended to fractional numbers similar to how decimal numbers are written to the right of the radix point.\nIn decimal or binary, integer values and terminating fractions have multiple representations. For example, formula_1 = 0.1 = 0.10 = 0.09. And, formula_2 = 0.1 = 0.10 = 0.01. Some balanced ternary fractions have multiple representations too. For example, formula_3 = 0.1T = 0.01. Certainly, in the decimal and binary, we may omit the rightmost trailing infinite 0s after the radix point and gain a representations of integer or terminating fraction. But, in balanced ternary, we can't omit the rightmost trailing infinite –1s after the radix point in order to gain a representations of integer or terminating fraction.\n\nDonald Knuth has pointed out that truncation and rounding are the same operation in balanced ternary — they produce exactly the same result (a property shared with other balanced numeral systems). The number is not exceptional; it has two equally valid representations, and two equally valid truncations: 0.1 (round to 0, and truncate to 0) and 1.T (round to 1, and truncate to 1).\n\nThe basic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—are done as in regular ternary. Multiplication by two can be done by adding a number to itself, or subtracting itself after a-trit-left-shifting.\n\nAn arithmetic shift left of a balanced ternary number is the equivalent of multiplication by a (positive, integral) power of 3; and an arithmetic shift right of a balanced ternary number is the equivalent of division by a (positive, integral) power of 3.\n\nThe conversion of a repeating balanced ternary number to a fraction is analogous to converting a repeating decimal. For example (because of formula_4):\n\nAs in any other integer base, algebraic irrationals and transcendental numbers do not terminate or repeat. For example: \n\nUnbalanced ternary can be converted to balanced ternary notation in two ways: \nIf the three values of ternary logic are \"false\", \"unknown\" and \"true\", and these are mapped to balanced ternary as T, 0 and 1 and to conventional unsigned ternary values as 0, 1 and 2, then balanced ternary can be viewed as a biased number system analogous to the offset binary system.\nIf the ternary number has formula_7 trits, then the bias formula_8 is formula_9 which is represented as all ones in either conventional or biased form.\n\nAs a result, if these two representations are used for balanced and unsigned ternary numbers, an unsigned formula_7-trit positive ternary value can be converted to balanced form by adding the bias formula_8 and a positive balanced number can be converted to unsigned form by subtracting the bias formula_8. Furthermore, if formula_13 and formula_14 are balanced numbers, their balanced sum is formula_15 when computed using conventional unsigned ternary arithmetic. Similarly, if formula_13 and formula_14 are conventional unsigned ternary numbers, their sum is formula_18 when computed using balanced ternary arithmetic.\n\nWe may convert to balanced ternary with the following formula:\n\nwhere,\n\nFor instance,\n\nThe single-trit addition, subtraction, multiplication and division tables are shown below. For subtraction and division, which are not commutative, the first operand is given to the left of the table, while the second is given at the top. For instance, the answer to 1-T = 1T is found in the bottom left corner of the subtraction table.\n\nMulti-trit addition and subtraction is analogous to that of binary and decimal. Add and subtract trit by trit, and add the carry appropriately.\nFor example:\n\nMulti-trit multiplication is analogous to that in decimal and binary.\n\nBalanced ternary division is analogous to decimal or binary division.\n\nHowever, 0.5 = 0.1111 ... or 1.TTTT ... . If the dividend over the plus or minus half divisor, the trit of the quotient must be 1 or T. If the dividend is between the plus and minus of half the divisor, the trit of the quotient is 0. The magnitude of the dividend must be compared with that of half the divisor before setting the quotient trit. For example,\n\nAnother example,\nAnother example,\n\nThe process of extracting the square root in balanced ternary is analogous to that in decimal or binary. \n\nAs in division, we should check the value of half the divisor first. For example,\nExtraction of the cube root in balanced ternary is similarly analogous to extraction in decimal or binary: \nLike division, we should check the value of half the divisor first too.\nFor example:\nHence = 1.259921 = 1.1T1 000 111 001 T01 00T 1T1 T10 111.\n\nBalanced ternary has other applications besides computing. For example, a classical two-pan balance, with one weight for each power of 3, can weigh relatively heavy objects accurately with a small number of weights, by moving weights between the two pans and the table. For example, with weights for each power of 3 through 81, a 60-gram object (60 = 1T1T0) will be balanced perfectly with an 81 gram weight in the other pan, the 27 gram weight in its own pan, the 9 gram weight in the other pan, the 3 gram weight in its own pan, and the 1 gram weight set aside.\n\nSimilarly, consider a currency system with coins worth 1¤, 3¤, 9¤, 27¤, 81¤. If the buyer and the seller each have only one of each kind of coin, any transaction up to 121¤ is possible. For example, if the price is 7¤ (7 = 1T1), the buyer pays 1¤ + 9¤ and receives 3¤ in change.\n\n\n"}

This model can explain that nodes with different characteristics acquire links at different rates. It predicts that a node's growth depends on its fitness and can calculate the degree distribution. The Bianconi–Barabási model is named after its inventors Ginestra Bianconi and Albert-László Barabási. This model is a variant of the Barabási–Albert model.\n\nThe Barabási–Albert (BA) model uses two concepts: growth and preferential attachment. Here, growth indicates the increase in the number of nodes in the network with time, and preferential attachment means that more connected nodes receive more links. The Bianconi–Barabási model, on top of these two concepts, uses another new concept called the fitness. This model makes use of an analogy with evolutionary models. It assigns an intrinsic fitness value to each node, which embodies all the properties other than the degree. The higher the fitness, the higher the probability of attracting new edges. Fitness can be defined as the ability to attract new links – \"a quantitative measure of a node's ability to stay in front of the competition\".\n\nWhile the Barabási–Albert (BA) model explains the \"first mover advantage\" phenomenon, the Bianconi–Barabási model explains how latecomers also can win. In a network where fitness is an attribute, a node with higher fitness will acquire links at a higher rate than less fit nodes. This model explains that age is not the best predictor of a node's success, rather latecomers also have the chance to attract links to become a hub.\n\nThe Bianconi–Barabási model can reproduce the degree correlations of the Internet Autonomous Systems. This model can also show condensation phase transitions in the evolution of complex network.\n\nWhile the BA model is useful in growing networks, the Bianconi–Barabási model also works in case of static networks where the number of nodes is fixed. The BB model can predict the topological properties of Internet.\n\nThe fitness network begins with a fixed number of interconnected nodes. They have different fitness, which can be described with fitness parameter, formula_1 which is chosen from a fitness distribution \"ρ\"(\"η\").\n\nThe assumption here is that a node’s fitness is independent of time, and is fixed. \nA new node \"j\" with \"m\" links and a fitness formula_1 is added with each time-step.\n\nThe probability Πi that a new node connects to one of the existing links to a node i in the network depends on the number of edges, formula_3, and on the fitness formula_4 of node \"i\", such that,\n\nEach node’s evolution with time can be predicted using the continuum theory. If initial number of node is \"m\", then the degree of node \"i\" changes at the rate:\n\nAssuming the evolution of formula_7 follows a power law with a fitness exponent formula_8\n\nHere, formula_10\n\nIf all fitnesses are equal in a fitness network, the Bianconi–Barabási model reduces to the Barabási–Albert model.\n\nWhen fitnesses are equal, the probability formula_11 that the new node is connected to node formula_12 when formula_7 is the degree of node formula_12 is,\n\nDegree distribution of the Bianconi–Barabási model depends on the fitness distribution ρ(η). There are two scenarios that can happen based on the probability distribution. If the fitness distribution has a finite domain, then the degree distribution will have a power-law just like the BA model. In the second case, if the fitness distribution has an infinite domain, then the node with the highest fitness value will attract a large number of nodes and show a winners-take-all scenario. As the Bianconi–Barabási model does not always show the power-law distribution, it has certain advantages such that this model can be used in non-heterogeneous networks such as World Trade Web.\n\nMeasuring node fitnesses from empirical network data\n\nThere are various statistical methods to measure node fitnesses formula_16 in the Bianconi–Barabási model from real-world network data. From the measurement, one can investigate the fitness distribution ρ(η) or compare the Bianconi–Barabási model with various competing network models in that particular network.\n\nIn 1999, Albert-László Barabási requested his student Bianconi to investigate evolving networks where nodes have a fitness parameter. Barabási was interested in finding out how Google, a latecomer in the search engine market, became a top player. Google’s toppling of previous top search engines went against Barabási's BA model, which states that first mover has an advantage. In the scale-free network if a node appears first it will be most connected because it had the longest time to attract links. Bianconi's work showed that when fitness parameter is present, the \"early bird\" is not always the winner. Bianconi and Barabási's research showed that fitness is what creates or breaks the hub. Google's superior PageRank algorithm helped them to beat other top players. Later on Facebook came and dethroned Google as Internet's most linked website. In all these cases fitness mattered which was first showed in Bianconi and Barabási's research. In 2001, Ginestra Bianconi and Albert-László Barabási published the model in the Europhysics Letters. In another paper, substituting fitness for energy, nodes for energy level and links for particles, Bianconi and Barabási were able to map the fitness model with Bose gas.\n\n\n"}

An \"ordinary transition process\" is characterized by asymptotic approach of the dynamical system from the state defined by its initial conditions to the state corresponding to its stable stationary regime in the basin of attraction of which the system found itself. However, near the bifurcation boundary can be observed two types of transition processes: passing through the place of the vanished stationary regime, the dynamic system slows down its asymptotic motion temporarily, \"as if recollecting the defunct orbit\", with the number of revolutions of the phase trajectory in this area of bifurcation memory depending on proximity of the corresponding parameter of the system to its bifurcation value, — and only then the phase trajectory rushes to the state that corresponds to stable stationary regime of the system.\n\nIn the literature, the effect of bifurcation memory is associated with a dangerous \"bifurcation of merging\".\n\nThe twice repeated bifurcation memory effects in dynamical systems were also described in literature; they were observed, when parameters of the dynamical system under consideration were chosen in the area of either crossing two different bifurcation boundaries, or their close neighbourhood.\n\nIt is claimed that the term \"bifurcation memory\":\n\nThe earliest of those described on this subject in the scientific literature should be recognized, perhaps, the result presented in 1973, which was obtained under the guidance of , a Soviet academician, and which initiated then a number of foreign studies of the mathematical problem known as \"stability loss delay for dynamical bifurcations\".\n\nA new wave of interest in the study of the strange behaviour of dynamic systems in a certain region of the state space has been caused by the desire to explain the non-linear effects revealed during the getting out of controllability of ships.\n\nSubsequently, similar phenomena were also found in biological systems — in the system of blood coagulation and in one of the mathematical models of myocardium.\n\nThe topicality of scientific studies of the bifurcation memory is obviously driven by the desire to prevent conditions of reduced controllability of the vehicle.\n\nIn addition, the special sort of tachycardias connected with the effects of bifurcation memory are considered in cardiophysics.\n\n"}

The performance of the closed loop system is monitored by the coefficient diagram. \n\nThe most considerable advantages of CDM can be listed as follows:\n\n1. The design procedure is easily understandable, systematic and useful. Therefore, the coefficients of the\nCDM controller polynomials can be determined more easily than those of the PID or other types of controller. This creates the possibility of an easy realisation for a new designer to control any kind of system.\n\n2. There are explicit relations between the performance parameters specified before the design and the coefficients of the controller polynomials as described in. For this reason, the designer can easily realize many control systems having different performance properties for a given control problem in a wide range of freedom.\n\n3. The development of different tuning methods is required for time delay processes of different properties\nin PID control. But it is sufficient to use the single design procedure in the CDM technique. This is an outstanding advantage.\n\n4. It is particularly hard to design robust controllers realizing the desired performance properties for unstable, integrating and oscillatory processes having poles near the imaginary axis. It has been reported that successful designs can be achieved even in these cases by using CDM.\n\n5. It is theoretically proven that CDM design is equivalent to LQ design with proper state augmentation. Thus, CDM can be considered an ‘‘improved LQG’’, because the order of the controller is smaller and weight selection rules are also given.\n\nIt is usually required that the controller for a given plant should be designed under some practical limitations.\nThe controller is desired to be of minimum degree, minimum phase (if possible) and stable. It must have enough bandwidth and power rating limitations. If the controller is designed without considering these limitations, the robustness property will be very poor, even though the stability and time response requirements are met. CDM controllers designed while considering all these problems is of the lowest degree, has a convenient bandwidth and results with a unit step time response without an overshoot. These properties guarantee the robustness, the sufficient damping of the disturbance effects and the low economic property. \n\nAlthough the main principles of CDM have been known since the 1950s, the first systematic method was proposed by Shunji Manabe. He developed a new method that easily builds a target characteristic polynomial to meet the desired time response. CDM is an algebraic approach combining classical and modern control theories and uses polynomial representation in the mathematical expression. The advantages of the classical and modern control techniques are integrated with the basic principles of this method, which is derived by making use of the previous experience and knowledge of the controller design. Thus, an efficient and fertile control method has appeared as a tool with which control systems can be designed without needing much experience and without confronting many problems.\n\nMany control systems have been designed successfully using CDM. It is very easy to design a controller under the conditions of stability, time domain performance and robustness. The close relations between these conditions and coefficients of the characteristic polynomial can be simply determined. This means that CDM is effective not only for control system design but also for controller parameters tuning.\n\n\n"}

In other words, \"G\"/\"N\" is abelian if and only if \"N\" contains the commutator subgroup. So in some sense it provides a measure of how far the group is from being abelian; the larger the commutator subgroup is, the \"less abelian\" the group is.\n\nFor elements \"g\" and \"h\" of a group \"G\", the commutator of \"g\" and \"h\" is formula_1. The commutator formula_2 is equal to the identity element \"e\" if and only if formula_3 , that is, if and only if \"g\" and \"h\" commute. In general, formula_4.\n\nHowever, the notation is somewhat arbitrary and there is a non-equivalent variant definition for the commutator that has the inverses on the right hand side of the equation: formula_5 in which case formula_6 but instead formula_7.\n\nAn element of \"G\" which is of the form formula_2 for some \"g\" and \"h\" is called a commutator. The identity element \"e\" = [\"e\",\"e\"] is always a commutator, and it is the only commutator if and only if \"G\" is abelian.\n\nHere are some simple but useful commutator identities, true for any elements \"s\", \"g\", \"h\" of a group \"G\":\n\n\nThe first and second identities imply that the set of commutators in \"G\" is closed under inversion and conjugation. If in the third identity we take \"H\" = \"G\", we get that the set of commutators is stable under any endomorphism of \"G\". This is in fact a generalization of the second identity, since we can take \"f\" to be the conjugation automorphism on \"G\", formula_17, to get the second identity.\n\nHowever, the product of two or more commutators need not be a commutator. A generic example is [\"a\",\"b\"][\"c\",\"d\"] in the free group on \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\". It is known that the least order of a finite group for which there exists two commutators whose product is not a commutator is 96; in fact there are two nonisomorphic groups of order 96 with this property.\n\nThis motivates the definition of the commutator subgroup formula_18 (also called the derived subgroup, and denoted formula_19 or formula_20) of \"G\": it is the subgroup generated by all the commutators.\n\nIt follows from the properties of commutators that any element of formula_18 is of the form\n\nfor some natural number formula_23, where the \"g\" and \"h\" are elements of \"G\". Moreover, since formula_24, the commutator subgroup is normal in \"G\". For any homomorphism \"f\": \"G\" → \"H\",\n\nso that formula_26.\n\nThis shows that the commutator subgroup can be viewed as a functor on the category of groups, some implications of which are explored below. Moreover, taking \"G\" = \"H\" it shows that the commutator subgroup is stable under every endomorphism of \"G\": that is, [\"G\",\"G\"] is a fully characteristic subgroup of \"G\", a property which is considerably stronger than normality.\n\nThe commutator subgroup can also be defined as the set of elements \"g\" of the group which have an expression as a product \"g\" = \"g\" \"g\" ... \"g\" that can be rearranged to give the identity.\n\nThis construction can be iterated:\nThe groups formula_29 are called the second derived subgroup, third derived subgroup, and so forth, and the descending normal series\nis called the derived series. This should not be confused with the lower central series, whose terms are formula_31.\n\nFor a finite group, the derived series terminates in a perfect group, which may or may not be trivial. For an infinite group, the derived series need not terminate at a finite stage, and one can continue it to infinite ordinal numbers via transfinite recursion, thereby obtaining the transfinite derived series, which eventually terminates at the perfect core of the group.\n\nGiven a group formula_32, a quotient group formula_33 is abelian if and only if formula_34.\n\nThe quotient formula_35 is an abelian group called the abelianization of formula_32 or formula_32 made abelian. It is usually denoted by formula_38 or formula_39.\n\nThere is a useful categorical interpretation of the map formula_40. Namely formula_41 is universal for homomorphisms from formula_32 to an abelian group formula_43: for any abelian group formula_43 and homomorphism of groups formula_45 there exists a unique homomorphism formula_46 such that formula_47. As usual for objects defined by universal mapping properties, this shows the uniqueness of the abelianization \"G\" up to canonical isomorphism, whereas the explicit construction formula_48 shows existence.\n\nThe abelianization functor is the left adjoint of the inclusion functor from the category of abelian groups to the category of groups. The existence of the abelianization functor Grp → Ab makes the category Ab a reflective subcategory of the category of groups, defined as a full subcategory whose inclusion functor has a left adjoint. \n\nAnother important interpretation of formula_38 is as formula_50, the first homology group of formula_32 with integral coefficients.\n\nA group \"G\" is an abelian group if and only if the derived group is trivial: [\"G\",\"G\"] = {\"e\"}. Equivalently, if and only if the group equals its abelianization. See above for the definition of a group's abelianization.\n\nA group \"G\" is a perfect group if and only if the derived group equals the group itself: [\"G\",\"G\"] = \"G\". Equivalently, if and only if the abelianization of the group is trivial. This is \"opposite\" to abelian.\n\nA group with formula_52 for some \"n\" in N is called a solvable group; this is weaker than abelian, which is the case \"n\" = 1.\n\nA group with formula_53 for all \"n\" in N is called a non-solvable group.\n\nA group with formula_54 for some ordinal number, possibly infinite, is called a hypoabelian group; this is weaker than solvable, which is the case α is finite (a natural number).\n\n\nSince the derived subgroup is characteristic, any automorphism of \"G\" induces an automorphism of the abelianization. Since the abelianization is abelian, inner automorphisms act trivially, hence this yields a map\n\n\n"}

Unlike internal and external validity, ecological validity is not necessary to the overall validity of a study.\n\nEcological validity is often confused with external validity—the property of a measurement process that reflects our ability to generalize from a study's results to circumstances beyond the research setting. While the two forms of validity are closely related, they are independent—a study may possess external validity but not ecological validity, and vice versa. For example, mock-jury research is designed to study how people might act if they were jurors during a trial, but many mock-jury studies simply provide written transcripts or summaries of trials, and do so in classroom or office settings. Such experiments do not approximate the actual look, feel and procedure of a real courtroom trial, and therefore lack ecological validity. The better recognized concern is that of external validity: if the results from such a mock-jury study are reproduced in trials where the conditions are better controlled, then the measurement process may be deemed externally valid. However, an ecologically valid measurement of a variable in a simulated environment is intended to yield results that can be generalized to real-life situations. Improving the ecological validity of an experiment typically improves the external validity as well.\n\nThe original meaning of 'ecological validity' defines it more narrowly as a property of stimuli in perceptual experiments. The popular use, broadly equivalent to 'realism', has overtaken it, at least in A Level Psychology circles. 'Representative design' captures the popular usage of ecological validity and can be used in its place.\n"}

Without the Higgs mechanism, all bosons (one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions) would be considered massless, but measurements show that the W, W, and Z bosons actually have relatively large masses of around 80 GeV/c. The Higgs field resolves this conundrum. The simplest description of the mechanism adds a quantum field (the Higgs field) that permeates all space, to the Standard Model. Below some extremely high temperature, the field causes spontaneous symmetry breaking during interactions. The breaking of symmetry triggers the Higgs mechanism, causing the bosons it interacts with to have mass. In the Standard Model, the phrase \"Higgs mechanism\" refers specifically to the generation of masses for the W, and Z weak gauge bosons through electroweak symmetry breaking. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN announced results consistent with the Higgs particle on 14 March 2013, making it extremely likely that the field, or one like it, exists, and explaining how the Higgs mechanism takes place in nature.\n\nThe mechanism was proposed in 1962 by Philip Warren Anderson, following work in the late 1950s on symmetry breaking in superconductivity and a 1960 paper by Yoichiro Nambu that discussed its application within particle physics.\n\nA theory able to finally explain mass generation without \"breaking\" gauge theory was published almost simultaneously by three independent groups in 1964: by Robert Brout and François Englert; by Peter Higgs; and by Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, and Tom Kibble. The Higgs mechanism is therefore also called the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism, or Englert-Brout-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble mechanism, Anderson-Higgs mechanism, Anderson-Higgs-Kibble mechanism, Higgs-Kibble mechanism by Abdus Salam and ABEGHHK'tH mechanism [for Anderson, Brout, Englert, Guralnik, Hagen, Higgs, Kibble, and 't Hooft] by Peter Higgs.\n\nOn 8 October 2013, following the discovery at CERN's Large Hadron Collider of a new particle that appeared to be the long-sought Higgs boson predicted by the theory, it was announced that Peter Higgs and François Englert had been awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nThe Higgs mechanism was incorporated into modern particle physics by Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam, and is an essential part of the standard model.\n\nIn the standard model, at temperatures high enough that electroweak symmetry is unbroken, all elementary particles are massless. At a critical temperature, the Higgs field becomes tachyonic; the symmetry is spontaneously broken by condensation, and the W and Z bosons acquire masses (also called “electroweak symmetry breaking”, or \"EWSB\".)\n\nFermions, such as the leptons and quarks in the Standard Model, can also acquire mass as a result of their interaction with the Higgs field, but not in the same way as the gauge bosons.\n\nIn the standard model, the Higgs field is an SU(2) doublet (i.e. the standard representation with two complex components called isospin), which is a scalar under Lorentz transformations. Its electric charge is zero; its weak isospin is ; its weak hypercharge (the charge for the U(1) gauge group) is 1 . Under U(1) rotations, it is multiplied by a phase, which thus mixes the real and imaginary parts of the complex spinor into each other, combining to the standard two-component complex representation of the group U(2).\n\nThe Higgs field, through the interactions specified (summarized, represented, or even simulated) by its potential, induces spontaneous breaking of three out of the four generators (\"directions\") of the gauge group U(2). This is often written as SU(2) × U(1), (which is strictly speaking only the same on the level of infinitesimal symmetries) because the diagonal phase factor also acts on other fields – quarks in particular. Three out of its four components would ordinarily resolve as Goldstone bosons, if they were not coupled to gauge fields.\n\nHowever, after symmetry breaking, these three of the four degrees of freedom in the Higgs field mix with the three W and Z bosons (, and ), and are only observable as components of these weak bosons, which are made massive by their inclusion; only the single remaining degree of freedom becomes a new scalar particle: the Higgs boson.\n\nThe gauge group of the electroweak part of the standard model is SU(2) × U(1). The group SU(2) is the group of all 2-by-2 unitary matrices with unit determinant; all the orthonormal changes of coordinates in a complex two dimensional vector space.\n\nRotating the coordinates so that the second basis vector points in the direction of the Higgs boson makes the vacuum expectation value of \"H\" the spinor (0, \"v\"). The generators for rotations about the \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\" axes are by half the Pauli matrices \"σ\", \"σ\", and \"σ\", so that a rotation of angle \"θ\" about the \"z\"-axis takes the vacuum to\n\nWhile the \"T\" and \"T\" generators mix up the top and bottom components of the spinor, the \"T\" rotations only multiply each by opposite phases. This phase can be undone by a U(1) rotation of angle \"θ\". Consequently, under both an SU(2) \"T\"-rotation and a U(1) rotation by an amount \"θ\", \"the vacuum is invariant\".\n\nThis combination of generators\n\ndefines the unbroken part of the gauge group, where \"Q\" is the electric charge, \"T\" is the generator of rotations around the z-axis in the SU(2) and \"Y\" is the hypercharge generator of the U(1). This combination of generators (a \"z\" rotation in the SU(2) and a simultaneous U(1) rotation by half the angle) preserves the vacuum, and defines the unbroken gauge group in the standard model, namely \"the electric charge\" group. The part of the gauge field in this direction stays massless, and amounts to the physical photon.\n\nIn spite of the introduction of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the mass terms preclude chiral gauge invariance. For these fields, the mass terms should always be replaced by a gauge-invariant \"Higgs\" mechanism. One possibility is some kind of \"Yukawa coupling\" (see below) between the fermion field \"ψ\" and the Higgs field Φ, with unknown couplings \"G\", which after symmetry breaking (more precisely: after expansion of the Lagrange density around a suitable ground state) again results in the original mass terms, which are now, however (i.e., by introduction of the Higgs field) written in a gauge-invariant way. The Lagrange density for the Yukawa interaction of a fermion field \"ψ\" and the Higgs field Φ is\n\nwhere again the gauge field \"A\" only enters \"D\" (i.e., it is only indirectly visible). The quantities \"γ\" are the Dirac matrices, and \"G\" is the already-mentioned Yukawa coupling parameter. Now the mass-generation follows the same principle as above, namely from the existence of a finite expectation value formula_4. Again, this is crucial for the existence of the property \"mass\".\n\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking offered a framework to introduce bosons into relativistic quantum field theories. However, according to Goldstone's theorem, these bosons should be massless. The only observed particles which could be approximately interpreted as Goldstone bosons were the pions, which Yoichiro Nambu related to chiral symmetry breaking.\n\nA similar problem arises with Yang–Mills theory (also known as non-Abelian gauge theory), which predicts massless spin-1 gauge bosons. Massless weakly-interacting gauge bosons lead to long-range forces, which are only observed for electromagnetism and the corresponding massless photon. Gauge theories of the weak force needed a way to describe massive gauge bosons in order to be consistent.\n\nThat breaking gauge symmetries did not lead to massless particles was observed in 1961 by Julian Schwinger, but he did not demonstrate massive particles would eventuate. This was done in Philip Warren Anderson's 1962 paper but only in non-relativistic field theory; it also discussed consequences for particle physics but did not work out an explicit relativistic model. The relativistic model was developed in 1964 by three independent groups:\nSlightly later, in 1965, but independently from the other publications the mechanism was also proposed by Alexander Migdal and Alexander Polyakov, at that time Soviet undergraduate students. However, their paper was delayed by the editorial office of JETP, and was published late, in 1966.\n\nThe mechanism is closely analogous to phenomena previously discovered by Yoichiro Nambu involving the \"vacuum structure\" of quantum fields in superconductivity. A similar but distinct effect (involving an affine realization of what is now recognized as the Higgs field), known as the Stueckelberg mechanism, had previously been studied by Ernst Stueckelberg.\n\nThese physicists discovered that when a gauge theory is combined with an additional field that spontaneously breaks the symmetry group, the gauge bosons can consistently acquire a nonzero mass. In spite of the large values involved (see below) this permits a gauge theory description of the weak force, which was independently developed by Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam in 1967. Higgs's original article presenting the model was rejected by Physics Letters. When revising the article before resubmitting it to Physical Review Letters, he added a sentence at the end, mentioning that it implies the existence of one or more new, massive scalar bosons, which do not form complete representations of the symmetry group; these are the Higgs bosons.\n\nThe three papers by Brout and Englert; Higgs; and Guralnik, Hagen, and Kibble were each recognized as \"milestone letters\" by \"Physical Review Letters\" in 2008. While each of these seminal papers took similar approaches, the contributions and differences among the 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers are noteworthy. All six physicists were jointly awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics for this work.\n\nBenjamin W. Lee is often credited with first naming the \"Higgs-like\" mechanism, although there is debate around when this first occurred. One of the first times the \"Higgs\" name appeared in print was in 1972 when Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus J. G. Veltman referred to it as the \"Higgs–Kibble mechanism\" in their Nobel winning paper.\n\nThe Higgs mechanism occurs whenever a charged field has a vacuum expectation value. In the nonrelativistic context, this is the Landau model of a charged Bose–Einstein condensate, also known as a superconductor. In the relativistic condensate, the condensate is a scalar field, and is relativistically invariant.\n\nThe Higgs mechanism is a type of superconductivity which occurs in the vacuum. It occurs when all of space is filled with a sea of particles which are charged, or, in field language, when a charged field has a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Interaction with the quantum fluid filling the space prevents certain forces from propagating over long distances (as it does in a superconducting medium; e.g., in the Ginzburg–Landau theory).\n\nA superconductor expels all magnetic fields from its interior, a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect. This was mysterious for a long time, because it implies that electromagnetic forces somehow become short-range inside the superconductor. Contrast this with the behavior of an ordinary metal. In a metal, the conductivity shields electric fields by rearranging charges on the surface until the total field cancels in the interior. But magnetic fields can penetrate to any distance, and if a magnetic monopole (an isolated magnetic pole) is surrounded by a metal the field can escape without collimating into a string. In a superconductor, however, electric charges move with no dissipation, and this allows for permanent surface currents, not just surface charges. When magnetic fields are introduced at the boundary of a superconductor, they produce surface currents which exactly neutralize them. The Meissner effect is due to currents in a thin surface layer, whose thickness, the London penetration depth, can be calculated from a simple model\n(the Ginzburg–Landau theory).\n\nThis simple model treats superconductivity as a charged Bose–Einstein condensate. Suppose that a superconductor contains bosons with charge \"q\". The wavefunction of the bosons can be described by introducing a quantum field, \"ψ\", which obeys the Schrödinger equation as a field equation (in units where the reduced Planck constant, \"ħ\", is set to 1):\n\nThe operator \"ψ\"(\"x\") annihilates a boson at the point \"x\", while its adjoint \"ψ\" creates a new boson at the same point. The wavefunction of the Bose–Einstein condensate is then the expectation value \"ψ\" of \"ψ\"(\"x\"), which is a classical function that obeys the same equation. The interpretation of the expectation value is that it is the phase that one should give to a newly created boson so that it will coherently superpose with all the other bosons already in the condensate.\n\nWhen there is a charged condensate, the electromagnetic interactions are screened. To see this, consider the effect of a gauge transformation on the field. A gauge transformation rotates the phase of the condensate by an amount which changes from point to point, and shifts the vector potential by a gradient:\n\nWhen there is no condensate, this transformation only changes the definition of the phase of \"ψ\" at every point. But when there is a condensate, the phase of the condensate defines a preferred choice of phase.\n\nThe condensate wave function can be written as\n\nwhere \"ρ\" is real amplitude, which determines the local density of the condensate. If the condensate were neutral, the flow would be along the gradients of \"θ\", the direction in which the phase of the Schrödinger field changes. If the phase \"θ\" changes slowly, the flow is slow and has very little energy. But now \"θ\" can be made equal to zero just by making a gauge transformation to rotate the phase of the field.\n\nThe energy of slow changes of phase can be calculated from the Schrödinger kinetic energy,\n\nand taking the density of the condensate \"ρ\" to be constant,\n\nFixing the choice of gauge so that the condensate has the same phase everywhere, the electromagnetic field energy has an extra term,\n\nWhen this term is present, electromagnetic interactions become short-ranged. Every field mode, no matter how long the wavelength, oscillates with a nonzero frequency. The lowest frequency can be read off from the energy of a long wavelength \"A\" mode,\n\nwhere now the non-Abelian field A is contained in the covariant derivative \"D\" and in the tensor components formula_12 and formula_13 (the relation between A and those components is well-known from the Yang–Mills theory).\n\nIt is exactly analogous to the Abelian Higgs model. Now the field \"φ\" is in a representation of the gauge group, and the gauge covariant derivative is defined by the rate of change of the field minus the rate of change from parallel transport using the gauge field A as a connection.\n\nAgain, the expectation value of Φ defines a preferred gauge where the vacuum is constant, and fixing this gauge, fluctuations in the gauge field A come with a nonzero energy cost.\n\nDepending on the representation of the scalar field, not every gauge field acquires a mass. A simple example is in the renormalizable version of an early electroweak model due to Julian Schwinger. In this model, the gauge group is SO(3) (or SU(2) − there are no spinor representations in the model), and the gauge invariance is broken down to U(1) or SO(2) at long distances. To make a consistent renormalizable version using the Higgs mechanism, introduce a scalar field \"φ\" which transforms as a vector (a triplet) of SO(3). If this field has a vacuum expectation value, it points in some direction in field space. Without loss of generality, one can choose the \"z\"-axis in field space to be the direction that \"φ\" is pointing, and then the vacuum expectation value of \"φ\" is , where \"A\" is a constant with dimensions of mass (formula_15).\n\nRotations around the \"z\"-axis form a U(1) subgroup of SO(3) which preserves the vacuum expectation value of \"φ\", and this is the unbroken gauge group. Rotations around the \"x\" and \"y\"-axis do not preserve the vacuum, and the components of the SO(3) gauge field which generate these rotations become massive vector mesons. There are two massive W mesons in the Schwinger model, with a mass set by the mass scale \"A\", and one massless U(1) gauge boson, similar to the photon.\n\nThe Schwinger model predicts magnetic monopoles at the electroweak unification scale, and does not predict the Z meson. It doesn't break electroweak symmetry properly as in nature. But historically, a model similar to this (but not using the Higgs mechanism) was the first in which the weak force and the electromagnetic force were unified.\n\nErnst Stueckelberg discovered a version of the Higgs mechanism by analyzing the theory of quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon. Effectively, Stueckelberg's model is a limit of the regular Mexican hat Abelian Higgs model, where the vacuum expectation value \"H\" goes to infinity and the charge of the Higgs field goes to zero in such a way that their product stays fixed. The mass of the Higgs boson is proportional to \"H\", so the Higgs boson becomes infinitely massive and decouples, so is not present in the discussion. The vector meson mass, however, equals to the product \"eH\", and stays finite.\n\nThe interpretation is that when a U(1) gauge field does not require quantized charges, it is possible to keep only the angular part of the Higgs oscillations, and discard the radial part. The angular part of the Higgs field \"θ\" has the following gauge transformation law:\n\nThe gauge covariant derivative for the angle (which is actually gauge invariant) is:\n\nIn order to keep \"θ\" fluctuations finite and nonzero in this limit, \"θ\" should be rescaled by H, so that its kinetic term in the action stays normalized. The action for the theta field is read off from the Mexican hat action by substituting formula_18.\n\nsince \"eH\" is the gauge boson mass. By making a gauge transformation to set , the gauge freedom in the action is eliminated, and the action becomes that of a massive vector field:\n\nTo have arbitrarily small charges requires that the U(1) is not the circle of unit complex numbers under multiplication, but the real numbers R under addition, which is only different in the global topology. Such a U(1) group is \"non-compact\". The field \"θ\" transforms as an affine representation of the gauge group. Among the allowed gauge groups, only non-compact U(1) admits affine representations, and the U(1) of electromagnetism is experimentally known to be compact, since charge quantization holds to extremely high accuracy.\n\nThe Higgs condensate in this model has infinitesimal charge, so interactions with the Higgs boson do not violate charge conservation. The theory of quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon is still a renormalizable theory, one in which electric charge is still conserved, but magnetic monopoles are not allowed. For non-Abelian gauge theory, there is no affine limit, and the Higgs oscillations cannot be too much more massive than the vectors.\n\n\n\n"}

This is effective because even though the attacker is equally likely to see any given plaintext, most plaintexts are extremely unlikely to be legitimate i.e. the distribution of legitimate plaintexts is \"non-\"uniform. Honey encryption defeats such attacks by first transforming the plaintext into a space such that the distribution of legitimate plaintexts \"is\" uniform. Thus an attacker guessing keys will see legitimate-looking plaintexts frequently and random-looking plaintexts infrequently. This makes it difficult to determine when the correct key has been guessed. In effect, honey encryption \"[serves] up fake data in response to every incorrect guess of the password or encryption key.\"\n\nThe security of honey encryption relies on the fact that the probability of an attacker judging a plaintext to be legitimate can be calculated (by the encrypting party) at the time of encryption. This makes honey encryption difficult to apply in certain applications e.g. where the space of plaintexts is very large or the distribution of plaintexts is unknown. It also means that honey encryption can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks if this probability is miscalculated. For example, it is vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks: if the attacker has a crib that a plaintext must match in order to be legitimate, they will be able to brute-force even Honey Encrypted data if the encryption did not take the crib into account.\n\nAn encrypted credit card number is susceptible to brute-force attacks because not every string of digits is equally likely. The number of digits can range from 13-19, though 16 is the most common. Additionally it must have a valid IIN and the last digit must match the checksum. An attacker can also take into account the popularity of various services: an IIN from MasterCard is probably more likely than an IIN from Diners Club Carte Blanche.\n\nHoney encryption can protect against these attacks by first mapping credit card numbers to a larger space where they match their likelihood of legitimacy. Numbers with invalid IINs and checksums are not mapped at all (i.e. have probability 0 of legitimacy). Numbers from large brands like MasterCard and Visa map to large regions of this space, while less popular brands map to smaller regions, etc. An attacker brute-forcing such an encryption scheme would only see legitimate-looking credit card numbers when they brute-force, and the numbers would appear with the frequency the attacker would expect from the real world.\n\nJuels and Ristenpart aim to use honey encryption to protect data stored on password manager services. Juels stated that \"password managers are a tasty target for criminals,\" and worries that \"if criminals get a hold of a large collection of encrypted password vaults they could probably unlock many of them without too much trouble.\"\n\nHristo Bojinov, CEO and founder of Anfacto, noted that \"Honey Encryption could help reduce their vulnerability. But he notes that not every type of data will be easy to protect this way. … Not all authentication or encryption system yield themselves to being honeyed.\"\n\n"}

For the nonnegative rank, it is required that the vectors must have nonnegative entries, and also that the coefficients in the linear combinations are nonnegative.\n\nThere are several equivalent definitions, all modifying the definition of the linear rank slightly. Apart from the definition given above, there is the following: The nonnegative rank of a nonnegative \"m×n\"-matrix \"A\" is equal to the smallest number \"q\" such there exists a nonnegative \"m×q\"-matrix \"B\" and a nonnegative \"q×n\"-matrix \"C\" such that \"A = BC\" (the usual matrix product).

The first product integral (\"Type I\" below) was developed by the mathematician Vito Volterra in 1887 to solve systems of linear differential equations. Other examples of product integrals are the geometric integral (\"Type II\" below), the bigeometric integral (\"Type III\" below), and some other integrals of non-Newtonian calculus.\n\nProduct integrals have found use in areas from epidemiology (the Kaplan–Meier estimator) to stochastic population dynamics using multiplication integrals (multigrals), analysis and quantum mechanics. The geometric integral, together with the geometric derivative, is useful in image analysis and in the study of growth/decay phenomena (e.g., in economic growth, bacterial growth, and radioactive decay). The bigeometric integral, together with the bigeometric derivative, is useful in some applications of fractals, and in the theory of elasticity in economics.\n\nThis article adopts the \"product\" formula_1 notation for product integration instead of the \"integral\" formula_2 (usually modified by a superimposed \"times\" symbol or letter P) favoured by Volterra and others. An arbitrary classification of types is also adopted to impose some order in the field.\n\nThe classical Riemann integral of a function formula_3 can be defined by the relation\n\nwhere the limit is taken over all partitions of the interval formula_5 whose norms approach zero.\n\nRoughly speaking, product integrals are similar, but take the limit of a product instead of the limit of a sum. They can be thought of as \"continuous\" versions of \"discrete\" products.\n\nThe most popular product integrals are the following:\n\nThe type I product integral corresponds to Volterra's original definition. The following relationship exists for scalar functions formula_7:\n\nwhich is not a multiplicative operator. (So the concepts of product integral and multiplicative integral are not the same). \n\nThe Volterra product integral is most useful when applied to matrix-valued functions or functions with values in a Banach algebra, where the last equality is no longer true (see the references below).\n\nFor scalar functions, the derivative in the Volterra system is the logarithmic derivative, and so the Volterra system is not a multiplicative calculus and is not a non-Newtonian calculus.\n\nwhich is called the geometric integral and is a multiplicative operator.\n\nThis definition of the product integral is the continuous analog of the discrete product operator\n(with formula_11) and the multiplicative analog to the (normal/standard/additive) integral\n(with formula_13):\n\nIt is very useful in stochastics, where the log-likelihood (i.e. the logarithm of a product integral of independent random variables) equals the integral of the logarithm of these (infinitesimally many) random variables:\n\nwhere \"r\" = ln \"a\", and \"s\" = ln \"b\".\n\nThe type III product integral is called the bigeometric integral and is a multiplicative operator.\n\n\nThe following results are for the type II product integral (the geometric integral). Other types produce other results.\n\nThe geometric integral (type II above) plays a central role in the geometric calculus, which is a multiplicative calculus.\n\n\nwhere formula_21 is the geometric derivative.\n\n\n\n\nwhere X is a random variable with probability distribution \"F\"(\"x\").\n\nCompare with the standard law of large numbers:\n\nJust like the Lebesgue version of (classical) integrals, one can compute product integrals by approximating them with the product integrals of simple functions. Each type of product integral has a different form for simple functions.\n\nBecause simple functions generalize step functions, in what follows we will only consider the special case of simple functions that are step functions. This will also make it easier to compare the Lebesgue definition with the Riemann definition.\n\nGiven a step function formula_26 with corresponding partition formula_27 and a tagged partition \n\none approximation of the \"Riemann definition\" of the type I product integral is given by\n\nThe (type I) product integral was defined to be, roughly speaking, the limit of these products by Ludwig Schlesinger in a 1931 article.\n\nAnother approximation of the \"Riemann definition\" of the type I product integral is defined as\n\nWhen formula_31 is a constant function, the limit of the first type of approximation is equal to the second type of approximation. Notice that in general, for a step function, the value of the second type of approximation doesn't depend on the partition, as long as the partition is a refinement of the partition defining the step function, whereas the value of the first type of approximation \"does\" depend on the fineness of the partition, even when it is a refinement of the partition defining the step function. \n\nIt turns out that that for \"any\" product-integrable function formula_31, the limit of the first type of approximation equals the limit of the second type of approximation. Since, for step functions, the value of the second type of approximation doesn't depend on the fineness of the partition for partitions \"fine enough\", it makes sense to define the \"Lebesgue (type I) product integral\" of a step function as\n\nwhere formula_34 is a tagged partition, and again formula_27 is the partition corresponding to the step function formula_31. (In contrast, the corresponding quantity would not be unambiguously defined using the first type of approximation.)\n\nThis generalizes to arbitrary measure spaces readily. If formula_37 is a measure space with measure formula_38, then for any product-integrable simple function formula_39 (i.e. a conical combination of the indicator functions for some disjoint measurable sets formula_40), its type I product integral is defined to be\n\nsince formula_42 is the value of formula_31 at any point of formula_44. In the special case where formula_45, formula_46 is Lebesgue measure, and all of the measurable sets formula_44 are intervals, one can verify that this is equal to the definition given above for that special case. Analogous to the theory of Lebesgue (classical) integrals, the Volterra product integral of any product-integrable function formula_31 can be written as the limit of an increasing sequence of Volterra product integrals of product-integrable simple functions.\n\nTaking logarithms of both sides of the above definition, one gets that for any product-integrable simple function formula_31:\n\nwhere we used the definition of integral for simple functions. Moreover, because continuous functions like formula_52 can be interchanged with limits, and the product integral of any product-integrable function formula_31 is equal to the limit of product integrals of simple functions, it follows that the relationship\n\nholds generally for \"any\" product-integrable formula_31. This clearly generalizes the property mentioned above.\n\nThe Volterra product integral is multiplicative as a set function, which can be shown using the above property. More specifically, given a product-integrable function formula_31 one can define a set function formula_57 by defining, for every measurable set formula_58, \n\nwhere formula_60 denotes the indicator function of formula_61. Then for any two \"disjoint\" measurable sets formula_62 one has\n\nThis property can be contrasted with measures, which are \"additive\" set functions.\n\nHowever the Volterra product integral is \"not\" multiplicative as a functional. Given two product-integrable functions formula_64, and a measurable set formula_65, it is generally the case that\n\nIf formula_37 is a measure space with measure formula_38, then for any product-integrable simple function formula_39 (i.e. a conical combination of the indicator functions for some disjoint measurable sets formula_40), its type II product integral is defined to be\n\nThis can be seen to generalize the definition given above.\n\nTaking logarithms of both sides, we see that for any product-integrable simple function formula_31:\n\nwhere we have used the definition of the Lebesgue integral for simple functions. This observation, analogous to the one already made above, allows one to entirely reduce the \"Lebesgue theory of geometric integrals\" to the Lebesgue theory of (classical) integrals. In other words, because continuous functions like formula_52 and formula_75 can be interchanged with limits, and the product integral of any product-integrable function formula_31 is equal to the limit of some increasing sequence of product integrals of simple functions, it follows that the relationship\n\nholds generally for \"any\" product-integrable formula_31.

Moriarty is a machiavellian criminal mastermind whom Holmes describes as the \"Napoleon of crime\". Doyle lifted the phrase from a Scotland Yard inspector who was referring to Adam Worth, a real-life criminal mastermind and one of the individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based. The character was introduced primarily as a narrative device to enable Doyle to kill Sherlock Holmes, and only featured in two of the Sherlock Holmes stories. However, in adaptations, he has often been given a greater prominence and treated as Sherlock Holmes' archenemy.\n\nMoriarty's first and only appearance occurred in \"The Adventure of the Final Problem\", in which Holmes, on the verge of delivering a fatal blow to Moriarty's criminal organization, is forced to flee to continental Europe to escape Moriarty's retribution. The criminal mastermind follows, and the pursuit ends on top of the Reichenbach Falls, an encounter that apparently ends with both Holmes and Moriarty falling to their deaths. In this story, Moriarty is introduced as a criminal mastermind who protects nearly all of the criminals of England in exchange for their obedience and a share in their profits. Holmes, by his own account, was originally led to Moriarty by his perception that many of the crimes he investigated were not isolated incidents, but instead the machinations of a vast and subtle criminal organization.\n\nMoriarty plays a direct role in only one other Holmes story, \"The Valley of Fear\", set before \"The Final Problem\" but written afterwards. In \"The Valley of Fear\", Holmes attempts to prevent Moriarty's agents from committing a murder. In an episode in which Moriarty is being interviewed by a policeman, a painting by Jean-Baptiste Greuze is described as hanging on the wall; Holmes remarks on another work by the same painter to show it could not have been purchased on a professor's salary. The work referred to is \"La jeune fille à l'agneau\"; some commentators have described this as a pun by Doyle on the Thomas Agnew and Sons art gallery, which had a famous \"Portrait of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire\" stolen by Adam Worth, but were unable to prove the claim.\n\nHolmes mentions Moriarty reminiscently in five other stories: \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" (the immediate sequel to \"The Final Problem\"), \"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\", \"The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\", \"The Adventure of the Illustrious Client\", and \"His Last Bow\". More obliquely, a 1908 mystery by Doyle that was named \"The Lost Special\" features a criminal genius who could be Moriarty and a detective who could be Holmes, although neither is mentioned by name. \n\nDoctor Watson, even when narrating, never meets Moriarty (only getting distant glimpses of him in \"The Final Problem\"), and relies upon Holmes to relate accounts of the detective's feud with the criminal. Doyle is inconsistent on Watson's familiarity with Moriarty. In \"The Final Problem\", Watson tells Holmes he has never heard of Moriarty, while in \"The Valley of Fear\", set earlier on, Watson already knows of him as \"the famous scientific criminal\".\n\nIn \"The Empty House\", Holmes states that Moriarty had commissioned a powerful air gun from a blind German mechanic surnamed von Herder, which was used by Moriarty's employee/acolyte Colonel Moran. It closely resembled a cane, allowing for easy concealment, was capable of firing revolver bullets at long range, and made very little noise when fired, making it ideal for sniping. Moriarty also has a marked preference for organizing \"accidents\". His attempts to kill Holmes include falling masonry and a speeding horse-drawn vehicle. He is also responsible for stage-managing the death of Birdy Edwards, making it appear that he was lost overboard while sailing to South Africa.\n\nMoriarty is highly ruthless, shown by his steadfast vow to Sherlock Holmes that \"if you are clever enough to bring destruction upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you\". Moriarty is categorised by Holmes as an extremely powerful criminal mastermind who is purely adept at committing any atrocity to perfection without losing any sleep over it. It is stated in \"The Final Problem\" that Moriarty does not directly participate in the activities he plans, but only orchestrates the events. As Holmes states below, what makes Moriarty so dangerous is his extremely cunning intellect:\n\nHolmes described Moriarty as follows: \n\nHolmes echoes and expounds this sentiment in \"The Valley of Fear\" stating: \n\nMoriarty has respect for Holmes's intelligence, stating that \"It has been an intellectual treat for me to see the manner in which you [Holmes] have grappled with this case\" and that \"it would be a grief for me to take an extreme measure.\" Nevertheless, he makes numerous attempts upon Holmes's life through his agents. He shows a fiery disposition, becoming enraged when his plans are thwarted and he is placed \"in positive danger of losing my liberty\" as well as furiously elbowing aside passengers in the train station in his pursuit of the disguised Holmes. Moriarty also shows a fiercely independent streak, pursuing Holmes to Switzerland alone, while by contrast Holmes takes Watson with him everywhere he goes.\n\nThe \"smaller university\" involved has been claimed to be one of the colleges that later comprised the University of Leeds; but in \"Sherlock Holmes: The Unauthorized Biography\", the \"smaller university\" is said to be Durham University.\n\nDoyle's original motive in creating Moriarty was evidently his intention to kill Holmes off. \"The Final Problem\" was intended to be exactly what its title says; Doyle sought to sweeten the pill by letting Holmes go in a blaze of glory, having rid the world of a criminal so powerful and dangerous any further task would be trivial in comparison (as Holmes says in the story itself). Eventually, however, public pressure and financial troubles impelled Doyle to bring Holmes back.\n\n\"Moriarty\" is an ancient Irish name as is Moran, the surname of Moriarty's henchman, Sebastian Moran. Doyle himself was of Irish Catholic descent, educated at Stonyhurst College, although he abandoned his family's religious tradition, neither marrying nor raising his children in the Catholic faith, nor cleaving to any politics that his ethnic background might presuppose. Doyle is known to have used his former school, Stonyhurst College, as inspiration for details of the Holmes series; among his contemporaries at the school were two boys surnamed Moriarty.\n\nThe stories give contradictory indications about Moriarty's family. In his first appearance in \"The Final Problem\", Moriarty is referred to as \"Professor Moriarty\" — no forename is mentioned. Watson does, however, refer to the name of another family member when he writes of \"the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother\". In \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Holmes refers to Moriarty on one occasion as \"Professor James Moriarty\". This is the only time Moriarty is given a first name, and oddly, it is the same as that of his purported brother; to wit \"The Valley of Fear\" (written after the preceding two stories, but set earlier), Holmes says of Professor Moriarty: \"He is unmarried. His younger brother is a station master in the west of England.\" In \"Sherlock Holmes: A Drama in Four Acts\", a stage play of which Doyle was a co-author, he is named Professor Robert Moriarty.\n\nln addition to the master criminal Adam Worth, there has been much speculation among astronomers and Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts that Doyle based his fictional character Moriarty on the Canadian-American astronomer Simon Newcomb. Newcomb was revered as a multitalented genius, with a special mastery of mathematics, and he had become internationally famous in the years before Doyle began writing his stories. More to the point, Newcomb had earned a reputation for spite and malice, apparently seeking to destroy the careers and reputations of rival scientists.\n\nMoriarty may have been inspired in part by two real-world mathematicians. If the characterisations of Moriarty's academic papers are reversed, they describe real mathematical events. Carl Friedrich Gauss wrote a famous paper on the dynamics of an asteroid in his early 20s, and was appointed to a chair partly on the strength of this result. Srinivasa Ramanujan wrote about generalisations of the binomial theorem, and earned a reputation as a genius by writing articles that confounded the best extant mathematicians. Gauss's story was well known in Doyle's time, and Ramanujan's story unfolded at Cambridge from early 1913 to mid 1914; \"The Valley of Fear\", which contains the comment about maths so abstruse that no one could criticise it, was published in September 1914. Irish mathematician Des MacHale has suggested George Boole may have been a model for Moriarty.\n\nJane Stanford, in \"That Irishman\", suggests that Doyle borrowed some of the traits and background of the Fenian John O'Connor Power for his portrayal of Moriarty. In \"Moriarty Unmasked: Conan Doyle and an Anglo-Irish Quarrel\", 2017, Stanford explores Doyle's relationship with the Irish literary and political community in London. She suggests that Moriarty, Ireland's Napoleon, represents the Fenian threat at the heart of the British Empire. It is averred that surviving Jesuit priests at the preparatory school Hodder Place, Stonyhurst, instantly recognised the physical description of Moriarty as that of the Rev. Thomas Kay, SJ, Prefect of Discipline, under whose authority Doyle fell as a wayward pupil. According to this hypothesis, Doyle as a private joke has Inspector MacDonald describe Moriarty: \"He'd have made a grand meenister with his thin face and grey hair and his solemn-like way of talking.\"\n\nThe model which Doyle himself cited (through Sherlock Holmes) in \"The Valley of Fear\" is the London arch-criminal of the 18th century, Jonathan Wild. He mentions this when seeking to compare Moriarty to a real-world character that Inspector Alec MacDonald might know, but it is in vain as MacDonald is not so well read as Holmes.\n\n"}

It culminates at the state championship held at Cranston High School West. Top schools from the state championship are invited to the New England Association of Math Leagues (NEAML) championship.\n\nEach meet consists of five rounds and a team round. Each team consists of five students, and each school may have as many as six teams. However, each team may have a maximum of two seniors and four sophomores/juniors. At least one sophomore or freshman must be on each team (or the team may compete with an empty slot). Three students from each team participate in a round. Therefore, each student participates in three rounds and the team round. The first five rounds consist of three questions each. Beginning in 2007, one of the five rounds is designated as \"calculator-free,\" and in 2008, this number was increased to two. The first question in each round is worth one point, the second two points, and the third three points. Each student works on the questions independently in the ten minutes allotted. All answers must be presented in simplified and rationalized form unless specified otherwise. After the completion of the first five rounds, there is a team round. All five players from each team collaborate on five questions worth two points each. The maximum score for one team is 100 points, and the maximum score for one student is 18 points.\n\nAt the first meet the rounds are as follows:\n\nRound 1: Arithmetic and Number Theory\n\nRound 2: Algebra I\n\nRound 3: Geometry\n\nRound 4: Algebra II\n\nRound 5: Statistics and Probability\n\nTeam Round\n\nAt the second meet the rounds are as follows:\n\nRound 1: Arithmetic and Number Theory\n\nRound 2: Algebra I\n\nRound 3: Geometry\n\nRound 4: Algebra II\n\nRound 5: Trigonometry\n\nTeam Round\n\nAt the third meet the rounds are as follows:\n\nRound 1: Statistics and Probability\n\nRound 2: Algebra I\n\nRound 3: Geometry\n\nRound 4: Algebra II\n\nRound 5: Trigonometry\n\nTeam Round\n\nAt the fourth meet the rounds are as follows:\n\nRound 1: Matrices\n\nRound 2: Algebra I\n\nRound 3: Geometry\n\nRound 4: Algebra II\n\nRound 5: Conic Sections and Analytical geometry\n\nTeam Round\n\nAt the playoff meet the rounds are as follows:\n\nRound 1: Arithmetic\n\nRound 2: Statistics, Probability, and Matrices\n\nRound 3: Algebra I\n\nRound 4: Geometry\n\nRound 5: Algebra II\n\nRound 6: Algebra II, Trigonometry, Conic Sections, and Analytical geometry\n\nAt the end of the six rounds, a relay round will occur, where 4 people from a team of 6 will participate. In this round, four questions are given, and you must use the answer from the previous question to answer the next one.\n\nAt the end of this, there will be a team round, where 4 people from the team will compete to answer 5 questions together.\n\nAs of the 2018-2019 year, calculators have been prohibited on all rounds, including the team rounds.\n\nThe 2007-08, and 2008-09 league champion was Wheeler School. Wheeler School ranked third among small schools at the 2006 and 2007 New England championships. In 2009 two seniors from Wheeler, Matthew Halpern and Karan Takhar, tied for first in the state.

SSP produces a higher rate of errors during attempted eavesdropping, thus making it easier to detect errors, as an eavesdropper must choose the right basis from three possible bases (Haitjema, 2016). Higher dimensional systems such as this have been proven to provide a higher level of security (Bruß & Macchiavello, 2002).\n\nSix-state protocol can be implemented without a quantum computer using only optical technologies.

The probability of using one of the bases equals 1/3. After receiving the string of qubits, Bob also randomly chooses one of three bases for measuring the state of each qubits. Using classical insecure, but authenticated, channel Alice and Bob communicate and discard measurements where Bob used the different basis for measure the state of the qubit than basis that Alice used for encoding.
