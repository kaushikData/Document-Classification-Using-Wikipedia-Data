{"id": "3975814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3975814", "title": "Ancient Egyptian multiplication", "text": "Ancient Egyptian multiplication\n\nIn mathematics, ancient Egyptian multiplication (also known as Egyptian multiplication, Ethiopian multiplication, Russian multiplication, or peasant multiplication), one of two multiplication methods used by scribes, was a systematic method for multiplying two numbers that does not require the multiplication table, only the ability to multiply and divide by 2, and to add. It decomposes one of the multiplicands (preferably the smaller) into a sum of powers of two and creates a table of doublings of the second multiplicand. This method may be called mediation and duplation, where mediation means halving one number and duplation means doubling the other number. It is still used in some areas.\n\nThe second Egyptian multiplication and division technique was known from the hieratic Moscow and Rhind Mathematical Papyri written in the seventeenth century B.C. by the scribe Ahmes.\n\nAlthough in ancient Egypt the concept of base 2 did not exist, the algorithm is essentially the same algorithm as long multiplication after the multiplier and multiplicand are converted to binary. The method as interpreted by conversion to binary is therefore still in wide use today as implemented by binary multiplier circuits in modern computer processors.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians had laid out tables of a great number of powers of two, rather than recalculating them each time. The decomposition of a number thus consists of finding the powers of two which make it up. The Egyptians knew empirically that a given power of two would only appear once in a number. For the decomposition, they proceeded methodically; they would initially find the largest power of two less than or equal to the number in question, subtract it out and repeat until nothing remained. (The Egyptians did not make use of the number zero in mathematics.)\n\nTo find the largest power of 2 keep doubling your answer starting with number 1, for example\n\nExample of the decomposition of the number 25:\n\nAfter the decomposition of the first multiplicand, it is necessary to construct a table of powers of two times the second multiplicand (generally the smaller) from one up to the largest power of two found during the decomposition. In the table, a line is obtained by multiplying the preceding line by two.\n\nFor example, if the largest power of two found during the decomposition is 16 (as in the case of the decomposition of 25, see example above), and the second multiplicand is 7, the table is created as follows:\nThe result is obtained by adding the numbers from the second column for which the corresponding power of two makes up part of the decomposition of the first multiplicand.\n\nThe main advantage of this technique is that it makes use of only addition, subtraction, and multiplication by two.\n\nHere, in actual figures, is how 238 is multiplied by 13. The lines are multiplied by two, from one to the next. A check mark is placed by the powers of two in the decomposition of 238.\n\nSince 238 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 32 + 64 + 128, distribution of multiplication over addition gives:\nIn the Russian peasant method, the powers of two in the decomposition of the multiplicand are found by writing it on the left and progressively halving the left column, discarding any remainder, until the value is 1 (or −1, in which case the eventual sum is negated), while doubling the right column as before. Lines with even numbers on the left column are struck out, and the remaining numbers on the right are added together.\n\nSince the 1880s, as formalized in the 1920s, an incomplete view has defined Egyptian multiplication. Springer's on-line encyclopedia summarizes the 1920s view:\n\nThe art of computation arose and developed long before the times of the oldest written records extant. The oldest mathematical records are the Cahoon papyri and the famous Rhind papyrus, which is believed to date back to about 2000 B.C.. An additive hieroglyphic system for the representation of numbers (cf. Numbers, representations of) enabled the ancient Egyptians to perform addition and subtraction operations on natural numbers in a relatively simple manner. Multiplication was carried out by doubling, i.e. the factors were decomposed into sums of powers of two, the individual summands were multiplied, and the components added. Operations on fractions (cf. Fraction) were reduced in Ancient Egypt to operations on aliquot fractions, i.e. on fractions of the type formula_1. More complicated fractions were decomposed with the aid of tables into a sum of aliquot fractions.\n\nThe 1920s conclusions properly decoded an incomplete additive version of Egyptian multiplication. The 1920s historians had not followed up an 1895 report that suggested a second form of multiplication method was present in Ahmes' RMP 2/n table and RMP 36. The second method included aliquot parts, as Springer suggested. Aliquot part were reported by F. Hultsch in 1895. Hultsch parsed Ahmes' 2/n table revealing aliquot part patterns. Yet, Springer's Egyptian multiplication encyclopedia entry did not specify critical aliquot part operational details that are required to translate the information into modern arithmetic statements. Sadly, 1920s math historians had skipped over several operational details, such as of F. Hultsch's 1895 aliquot part discussion points, thereby improperly concluding that aliquot part patterns had not been seen in Ahmes' 2/n table.\n\nThe aliquot part story line remained an unsolved issue until the 21st century. Shortly after 2002 the Kahun Papyrus and the RMP 2/n table revealed two aliquot part operational methods: (1) new inverse multiplication and division methods, and (2) a LCM number method written in red (RMP 38). The multiplication and division methods had been hidden Hultsch's aliquot part operational steps, including red auxiliary numbers steps that selected 'optimized' divisors of the LCM. In 2006, the 1895 Hultsch-Bruins method was confirmed from a second direction, detailing a common aliquot method used in the RMP and Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll. This method scaled the conversion of 1/p, 1/pq, 2/p, 2/pq, n/p and n/pq rational numbers by an LCM m, written as m/m.\n\nAhmes' aliquot part division steps, sensed in the 19th century, not decoded during the 20th century began to release its secrets after 2001, increasingly by 2006 and 2009 (by RMP 36). Two reasons had misdirected 1920s math historians. The first prematurely closed the subject of Egyptian fraction arithmetic operations by concluding Egyptian multiplication contained only additive steps. Second, scribal division was suggested have followed a non-inverse process called 'single false position'.\n\nMoreover, Springer followed the traditional 1920s definition of Egyptian division by suggesting: \"Division was carried out by subtracting from the number to be divided the numbers obtained by successive doubling of the divisor.\" Math historians call the 1920s proposed Egyptian division method 'single false position', although it was first documented in 800 AD. Later Arab texts improved its root finding 'double false position' method.\n\nSpringer's definition of Egyptian division was historically incomplete. To complete a definition of Egyptian division the first six RMP problems, a division by 10 labor rate (defined earlier in the Reisner Papyrus) set of problems are consulted. In addition, RMP algebra problems and methods are consulted. For example, Ahmes divided 28 by 97, in RMP 31 (confirmed in RMP 34) by solving: x + (2/3 + 1/2 + 1/7) x = 33 and x + (2/3 + 1/2 + 1/7) x = 37 as other vulgar fraction problems were solved in the Kahun Papyrus and Rhind Papyrus 2/n tables. Aliquot part steps were hidden in theoretical multiplication and division operations for over 100 years.\n\nAhmes did not mention 'single false position' in algebra problems, a valid point made by Robins-Shute in 1987. The inaccurate 1920s supposition has been replaced by parsing large vulgar fractions by stripping away the unit fraction notation. For example, 28/97, in RMP 31, and RMP 23 expose Ahmes' LCM multiplication method. In RMP 23 where a 45 multiplier was introduced to solve most of the problem. Yet, to read the complete problem LCM 360 was needed as other RMP algebra problems were solved.\n\nIn the 21st century, Ahmes is becoming clearly reported by converting vulgar fractions into optimized unit fractions series within a LCM method. The LCM method also applied aliquot parts of the denominator to solve 2/97 in RMP 31, and in 2/n table. Ahmes converted 28/97 into two problems, 2/97 and 26/97, selecting two LCM multipliers such that:\n\n\nformula_2<br>and,\n\nformula_3\n\nformula_4\n\nsuch that:\n\nformula_5\n\nand,\n\nformula_6\n\nas RMP 36 converted 30/53 by 2/53 + 28/53 with 2/53 scaled by (30/30) and 28/53 scaled by (2/2).\n\nOne implication is that 'single false position' represented a 20th-century supposition that failed to historically read Ahmes' additive numerators written in multiplication problems. Ahmes division operations, described by aliquot part steps in over 20 algebra problems, embed ancient and modern division methods, as inverse to Egyptian multiplications. Egyptian scribes applied several modern theoretical ideas, mostly arithmetic ones, as recorded in Ahmes math tool box.\n\nA second implication is contained in RMP 38. It details Ahmes multiplying 320 ro, one hekat, by 35/11 times 1/10 = 7/22, obtaining 101 + 9/11. Ahmes proved that 101 + 9/11 was correct by multiplying by the inverse of 7/22, or 22/7. Egyptian division generally applied an inverse of Egyptian multiplication in the 1900 BCE Akhmim Wooden Tablet (AWT) and all other Middle Kingdom mathematical texts. The AWT, for example. divided one hekat, (64/64), by n = 3, 7, 10, 11 and 13. Quotient and remainder answers were multiplied by divisor inverses, 1/3, 1/7, 1/10, 1/11 and 1/13, exactly returning the beginning rational number (64/64).\n\nFinally, the red numerator numerators implied by the 2/n table were directly discussed in RMP 36. Ahmes converted, 2/53, 3/53, 5/53, 15/53, 28/53 and 30/53 by two rules. The first rule scaled 2/53*(30/30) = 60/1590, 3/53(20/20) = 60/1060, 5/53*(12/12) = 60/636, 15/53*(4/4) = 60/212, 28/53*(2/2) = 56/106. The second rule converted 30/53 by parsing 30/53 into 2/53 + 28/53. as Ahmes has converted 28/97 by parsing 29/97 into 2/97 + 26/97.\n\nConclusion: To understand ancient Egyptian multiplication and division, Ahmes' 2/n table aliquot part arithmetic operational steps must be translated into modern arithmetic statements. Ahmes multiplication and division methods were inverse to each other, with RMP 38, and the AWT provided vivid examples of the arithmetic relationships. RMP 36 the details of two rational number conversion methods were detailed, one for n/p, n/pq, 2/p and 2/pq and another for hard to convert n/p rational numbers that were parsed into solvable 2/p and (n-2)/p statements.\n\nEgyptian multiplication contained two aspects, a theoretical side, and a practical side. Egyptian division by a rational number was Egyptian multiplication by an inverse of the rational number. Early Egyptian scholars had not considered the theoretical aspects of the RMP and other Egyptian texts until the 21st century. Theoretical definitions had been hidden in conversion of rational numbers by scaled multipliers applied in an aliquot part rule. RMP 38 multiplied a hekat, stated as 320 ro, by 7/22, and returned 320 ro by multiplying the answer by 22/7. Egyptian division was quotient and remainder based, theoretical aspects that scholars are increasingly studying in terms of aliquot parts, 2/n tables, and other ancient scribal applications after 2005.\n\n\n\n"}

It is named after Greek mathematician Apollonius of Perga.\n\nAn Apollonian gasket can be constructed as follows. Start with three circles \"C\", \"C\" and \"C\", each one of which is tangent to the other two (in the general construction, these three circles can be any size, as long as they have common tangents). Apollonius discovered that there are two other non-intersecting circles, \"C\" and \"C\", which have the property that they are tangent to all three of the original circles – these are called \"Apollonian circles\". Adding the two Apollonian circles to the original three, we now have five circles.\n\nTake one of the two Apollonian circles – say \"C\". It is tangent to \"C\" and \"C\", so the triplet of circles \"C\", \"C\" and \"C\" has its own two Apollonian circles. We already know one of these – it is \"C\" – but the other is a new circle \"C\".\n\nIn a similar way we can construct another new circle \"C\" that is tangent to \"C\", \"C\" and \"C\", and another circle \"C\" from \"C\", \"C\" and \"C\". This gives us 3 new circles. We can construct another three new circles from \"C\", giving six new circles altogether. Together with the circles \"C\" to \"C\", this gives a total of 11 circles.\n\nContinuing the construction stage by stage in this way, we can add 2·3 new circles at stage \"n\", giving a total of 3 + 2 circles after \"n\" stages. In the limit, this set of circles is an Apollonian gasket.\n\nThe sizes of the new circles are determined by Descartes' theorem. Let \"k\" (for \"i\" = 1, ..., 4) denote the curvatures of four mutually tangent circles. Then Descartes' Theorem states\n\nThe Apollonian gasket has a Hausdorff dimension of about 1.3057.\n\nThe curvature of a circle (bend) is defined to be the inverse of its radius.\n\n\nAn Apollonian gasket can also be constructed by replacing one of the generating circles by a straight line, which can be regarded as a circle passing through the point at infinity.\n\nAlternatively, two of the generating circles may be replaced by parallel straight lines, which can be regarded as being tangent to one another at infinity. In this construction, the additional circles form a family of Ford circles.\n\nThe three-dimensional equivalent of the Apollonian gasket is the Apollonian sphere packing.\n\nIf two of the original generating circles have the same radius and the third circle has a radius that is two-thirds of this, then the Apollonian gasket has two lines of reflective symmetry; one line is the line joining the centres of the equal circles; the other is their mutual tangent, which passes through the centre of the third circle. These lines are perpendicular to one another, so the Apollonian gasket also has rotational symmetry of degree 2; the symmetry group of this gasket is \"D\".\n\nIf all three of the original generating circles have the same radius then the Apollonian gasket has three lines of reflective symmetry; these lines are the mutual tangents of each pair of circles. Each mutual tangent also passes through the centre of the third circle and the common centre of the first two Apollonian circles. These lines of symmetry are at angles of 60 degrees to one another, so the Apollonian gasket also has rotational symmetry of degree 3; the symmetry group of this gasket is \"D\".\n\nThe three generating circles, and hence the entire construction, are determined by the location of the three points where they are tangent to one another. Since there is a Möbius transformation which maps any three given points in the plane to any other three points, and since Möbius transformations preserve circles, then there is a Möbius transformation which maps any two Apollonian gaskets to one another.\n\nMöbius transformations are also isometries of the hyperbolic plane, so in hyperbolic geometry all Apollonian gaskets are congruent. In a sense, there is therefore only one Apollonian gasket, up to (hyperbolic) isometry.\n\nThe Apollonian gasket is the limit set of a group of Möbius transformations known as a Kleinian group.\n\nIf any four mutually tangent circles in an Apollonian gasket all have integer curvature then all circles in the gasket will have integer curvature.\nSince the equation relating curvatures in an Apollonian gasket, integral or not, is\nit follows that one may move from one quadruple of curvatures to another by Vieta jumping, just as when finding a new Markov number.\nThe first few of these integral Apollonian gaskets are listed in the following table. The table lists the curvatures of the largest circles in the gasket. Only the first three curvatures (of the five displayed in the table) are needed to completely describe each gasket – all other curvatures can be derived from these three.\n\nIf none of the curvatures are repeated within the first five, the gasket contains no symmetry, which is represented by symmetry group \"C\"; the gasket described by curvatures (−10, 18, 23, 27) is an example.\n\nWhenever two of the largest five circles in the gasket have the same curvature, that gasket will have \"D\" symmetry, which corresponds to a reflection along a diameter of the bounding circle, with no rotational symmetry.\n\nIf two different curvatures are repeated within the first five, the gasket will have D symmetry; such a symmetry consists of two reflections (perpendicular to each other) along diameters of the bounding circle, with a two-fold rotational symmetry of 180°. The gasket described by curvatures (−1, 2, 2, 3) is the only Apollonian gasket (up to a scaling factor) to possess D symmetry.\n\nThere are no integer gaskets with \"D\" symmetry.\n\nIf the three circles with smallest positive curvature have the same curvature, the gasket will have \"D\" symmetry, which corresponds to three reflections along diameters of the bounding circle (spaced 120° apart), along with three-fold rotational symmetry of 120°. In this case the ratio of the curvature of the bounding circle to the three inner circles is formula_2. As this ratio is not rational, no integral Apollonian circle packings possess this \"D\" symmetry, although many packings come close.\n\nThe figure at left is an integral Apollonian gasket that appears to have \"D\" symmetry. The same figure is displayed at right, with labels indicating the curvatures of the interior circles, illustrating that the gasket actually possesses only the \"D\" symmetry common to many other integral Apollonian gaskets.\n\nThe following table lists more of these \"almost\"-\"D\" integral Apollonian gaskets. The sequence has some interesting properties, and the table lists a factorization of the curvatures, along with the multiplier needed to go from the previous set to the current one. The absolute values of the curvatures of the \"a\" disks obey the recurrence relation , from which it follows that the multiplier converges to formula_3\n\nFor any integer \"n\" > 0, there exists an Apollonian gasket defined by the following curvatures: (−\"n\", \"n\" + 1, \"n\"(\"n\" + 1), \"n\"(\"n\" + 1) + 1). For example, the gaskets defined by (−2, 3, 6, 7), (−3, 4, 12, 13), (−8, 9, 72, 73), and (−9, 10, 90, 91) all follow this pattern. Because every interior circle that is defined by \"n\" + 1 can become the bounding circle (defined by −\"n\") in another gasket, these gaskets can be nested. This is demonstrated in the figure at right, which contains these sequential gaskets with \"n\" running from 2 through 20.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40753902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40753902", "title": "Business process validation", "text": "Business process validation\n\nBusiness Process Validation (BPV) is the act of verifying that a set of end-to-end business processes function as intended. If there are problems in one or more business applications that support a business process, or in the integration or configuration of those systems, then the consequences of disruption to the business can be serious. A company might be unable to take orders or ship product – which can directly impact company revenue, reputation, and customer satisfaction. It can also drive additional expenses, as defects in production are much more expensive to fix than if identified earlier. For this reason, a key aim of Business Process Validation is to identify defects early, before new enterprise software is deployed in production so that there is no business impact and the cost of repairing defects is kept to a minimum.\n\nNote: BPV is unrelated to Validation (drug manufacture) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nDuring Business Process Validation (BPV), the business process is checked step-by-step using representative data to confirm that all business rules are working correctly and that all underlying transactions are performing properly across every enterprise application used in the business process. When defects are identified, these problems are logged for repair by IT personnel, business analysts or the software vendor, as appropriate.\n\nBusiness Process Validation can be performed on various timescales, including the following:\n\nManual Business Process Validation is where one or more people (typically a cross-functional team) work at keyboards or mobile devices to execute the various business process steps directly in the enterprise software by hand. Defects are manually noted and typically logged in a defect tracking system.\n\nThere are several shortcomings to the manual approach. First, since all data is entered by hand, it can be time consuming for subject matter experts and business analysts. These are expensive staff resources that could be deployed on other higher value activities. Second, manual testing extends project timelines. This slows the deployment of innovation and makes business users wait longer for cost saving and revenue generating new technology. Third, the manual process is often incomplete, since the time-intensive nature means that IT teams cannot test all business processes, given their resource constraints. This lack of coverage introduces technology risk in a company’s business processes. Finally, if business process validation is done manually by IT teams, then business requirements and processes have to be unambiguously documented in advance, which is a time-consuming task.\n\nAutomated Business Process Validation relies on software to execute the various business process steps directly in the enterprise software systems in an automated fashion. BPV software automatically uses standard business process data during the validation, and interprets the correctness of each transaction and result. Defects are automatically noted and logged.\n\nWith BPV software, the business process must first be \"captured\" in the BPV software system so that it can be automatically executed. This amounts to performing the business process once in the enterprise system with the BPV software running in the background to capture the process. Once the business process is captured, BPV software allows the business process automation to be modified with very little effort. Some BPV software have object-oriented designs that allow sub-processes to be shared among different end-to-end business processes, and business process automation can be easily copied and modified. This last feature is particularly helpful when companies have variations of business processes across geographies or business units. For example, an order shipment process in Europe may differ slightly from the same process in North America because there are differences in compliance requirements and Bills of Lading. There is no need to capture the second process end-to-end for automation purposes. The first process can easily be copied and modified in the BPV software. This enables companies to efficiently and quickly build their portfolio of business processes for automated validation.\n\nAn ancillary benefit is that once the business process is correctly captured, BPV software allows a complete and accurate description of the business process to be printed. This documentation is generated automatically with no additional effort and is useful for training, regulatory compliance, and other purposes. It is available on-demand and is typically very accurate because it is based on the most recent versions of systems and business practices. \nBPV software largely avoids the shortcomings of manual business process validation. The automation software can be configured to validate business processes on a 24/7/365 basis, if desired by the user. The frequency of automation enables any defects in underlying business systems and interfaces to be detected and repaired quickly, before business users are impacted.\n\nAutomated business process validation is a way to ensure that a company’s business processes continue to work, even when mission critical enterprise systems change.\n\n"}

It can be used to relate an invariant \"ƒ\" to the invariant Ω\"ƒ\", where Ω is Cayley's Ω process.\n\nSuppose that \"x\" for \"i\",\"j\" = 1...,\"n\" are commuting variables. Write \"E\" for the polarization operator \n\nThe Capelli identity states that the following differential operators, expressed as determinants, are equal:\n\nBoth sides are differential operators. The determinant on the left has non-commuting entries, and is expanded with all terms preserving their \"left to right\" order. Such a determinant is often called a \"column-determinant\", since it can be obtained by the column expansion of the determinant starting from the first column. It can be formally written as\n\nwhere in the product first come the elements from the first column, then from the second and so on. The determinant on the far right is Cayley's omega process, and the one on the left is the Capelli determinant.\n\nThe operators \"E\" can be written in a matrix form:\n\nwhere formula_6 are matrices with elements \"E\", \"x\", formula_7 respectively. If all elements in these matrices would be commutative then clearly formula_8. The Capelli identity shows that despite noncommutativity there exists a \"quantization\" of the formula above. The only price for the noncommutativity is a small correction: formula_9 on the left hand side. For generic noncommutative matrices formulas like\n\ndo not exist, and the notion of the 'determinant' itself does not make sense for generic noncommutative matrices. That is why the Capelli identity still holds some mystery, despite many proofs offered for it. A very short proof does not seem to exist. Direct verification of the statement can be given as an exercise for \"n\" = 2, but is already long for \"n\" = 3.\n\nConsider the following slightly more general context. Suppose that formula_11 and formula_12 are two integers and formula_13 for formula_14, be commuting variables. Redefine formula_15 by almost the same formula:\n\nwith the only difference that summation index formula_17 ranges from formula_18 to formula_12. One can easily see that such operators satisfy the commutation relations:\n\nHere formula_21 denotes the commutator formula_22. These are the same commutation relations which are satisfied by the matrices formula_23 which have zeros everywhere except the position formula_24, where 1 stands. (formula_23 are sometimes called \"matrix units\"). Hence we conclude that the correspondence formula_26 defines a representation of the Lie algebra formula_1 in the vector space of polynomials of formula_13.\n\nIt is especially instructive to consider the special case \"m\" = 1; in this case we have \"x\", which is abbreviated as \"x\":\n\nIn particular, for the polynomials of the first degree it is seen that:\n\nHence the action of formula_15 restricted to the space of first-order polynomials is exactly the same as the action of \"matrix units\" formula_23 on vectors in formula_33. So, from the representation theory point of view, the subspace of polynomials of first degree is a subrepresentation of the Lie algebra formula_1, which we identified with the standard representation in formula_33. Going further, it is seen that the differential operators formula_36 preserve the degree of the polynomials, and hence the polynomials of each fixed degree form a subrepresentation of the Lie algebra formula_1. One can see further that the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree \"k\" can be identified with the symmetric tensor power formula_38 of the standard representation formula_39.\n\nOne can also easily identify the highest weight structure of these representations. The monomial formula_40 is a highest weight vector, indeed: formula_41 for \"i\" < \"j\". Its highest weight equals to (\"k\", 0, ... ,0), indeed: formula_42.\n\nSuch representation is sometimes called bosonic representation of formula_1. Similar formulas formula_44 define the so-called fermionic representation, here formula_45 are anti-commuting variables. Again polynomials of \"k\"-th degree form an irreducible subrepresentation which is isomorphic to formula_46 i.e. anti-symmetric tensor power of formula_47. Highest weight of such representation is (0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0). These representations for \"k\" = 1, ..., \"n\" are fundamental representations of formula_1.\n\nLet us return to the Capelli identity. One can prove the following:\n\nthe motivation for this equality is the following: consider formula_50 for some commuting variables formula_51. The matrix formula_52 is of rank one and hence its determinant is equal to zero. Elements of matrix formula_53 are defined by the similar formulas, however, its elements do not commute. The Capelli identity shows that the commutative identity: formula_54 can be preserved for the small price of correcting matrix formula_53 by formula_56.\n\nLet us also mention that similar identity can be given for the characteristic polynomial:\n\nwhere formula_58. The commutative counterpart of this is a simple fact that for rank = 1 matrices the characteristic polynomial contains only the first and the second coefficients.\n\nLet us consider an example for \"n\" = 2.\n\nUsing\n\nwe see that this is equal to:\n\nAn interesting property of the Capelli determinant is that it commutes with all operators \"E\", that is, the commutator formula_63 is equal to zero. It can be generalized:\n\nConsider any elements \"E\" in any ring, such that they satisfy the commutation relation formula_64, (so they can be differential operators above, matrix units \"e\" or any other elements) define elements \"C\" as follows:\n\nwhere formula_66\n\nthen:\n\n\ni.e. they are sums of principal minors of the matrix \"E\", modulo the \"Capelli correction\" formula_68. In particular element \"C\" is the Capelli determinant considered above.\n\nThese statements are interrelated with the Capelli identity, as will be discussed below, and similarly to it the direct few lines short proof does not seem to exist, despite the simplicity of the formulation.\n\nThe universal enveloping algebra\n\ncan defined as an algebra generated by\n\nsubject to the relations\n\nalone. The proposition above shows that elements \"C\"belong to the center of formula_62. It can be shown that they actually are free generators of the center of formula_62. They are sometimes called \"Capelli generators\". The Capelli identities for them will be discussed below.\n\nConsider an example for \"n\" = 2.\n\nIt is immediate to check that element formula_74 commute with formula_15. (It corresponds to an obvious fact that the identity matrix commute with all other matrices). More instructive is to check commutativity of the second element with formula_15. Let us do it for formula_77:\n\nWe see that the naive determinant formula_82 will not commute with formula_83 and the Capelli's correction formula_84 is essential to ensure the centrality.\n\nLet us return to the general case:\n\nfor arbitrary \"n\" and \"m\". Definition of operators \"E\" can be written in a matrix form: formula_86, where formula_87 is formula_88 matrix with elements formula_15; formula_90 is formula_91 matrix with elements formula_13; formula_93 is formula_91 matrix with elements formula_7.\n\nCapelli–Cauchy–Binet identities\n\nFor general \"m\" matrix \"E\" is given as product of the two rectangular matrices: \"X\" and transpose to \"D\". If all elements of these matrices would commute then one knows that the determinant of \"E\" can be expressed by the so-called Cauchy–Binet formula via minors of \"X\" and \"D\". An analogue of this formula also exists for matrix \"E\" again for the same mild price of the correction formula_96:\n\nIn particular (similar to the commutative case): if \"m<n\", then formula_98; if \"m=n\" we return to the identity above.\n\nLet us also mention that similar to the commutative case (see Cauchy–Binet for minors), one can express not only the determinant of \"E\", but also its minors via minors of \"X\" and \"D\":\n\nHere \"K\" = (\"k\" < \"k\" < ... < \"k\"), \"L\" = (\"l\" < \"l\" < ... < \"l\"), are arbitrary multi-indexes; as usually formula_100 denotes a submatrix of \"M\" formed by the elements \"M\". Pay attention that the Capelli correction now contains \"s\", not \"n\" as in previous formula. Note that for \"s=1\", the correction (\"s\" − \"i\") disappears and we get just the definition of \"E\" as a product of \"X\" and transpose to \"D\". Let us also mention that for generic \"K,L\" corresponding minors do not commute with all elements \"E\", so the Capelli identity exists not only for central elements.\n\nAs a corollary of this formula and the one for the characteristic polynomial in the previous section let us mention the following:\n\nwhere formula_102 formula_103. This formula is similar to the commutative case, modula formula_104 at the left hand side and \"t\" instead of \"t\" at the right hand side.\n\nRelation to dual pairs\n\nModern interest in these identities has been much stimulated by Roger Howe who considered them in his theory of reductive dual pairs (also known as Howe duality). To make the first contact with these ideas, let us look more precisely on operators formula_36. Such operators preserve the degree of polynomials. Let us look at the polynomials of degree 1: formula_106, we see that index \"l\" is preserved. One can see that from the representation theory point of view polynomials of the first degree can be identified with direct sum of the representations formula_107, here \"l\"-th subspace (\"l=1...m\") is spanned by formula_108, \"i\" = 1, ..., \"n\". Let us give another look on this vector space:\n\nSuch point of view gives the first hint of symmetry between \"m\" and \"n\". To deepen this idea let us consider:\n\nThese operators are given by the same formulas as formula_15 modula renumeration formula_112, hence by the same arguments we can deduce that formula_113 form a representation of the Lie algebra formula_114 in the vector space of polynomials of \"x\". Before going further we can mention the following property: differential operators formula_113 commute with differential operators formula_116.\n\nThe Lie group formula_117 acts on the vector space formula_118 in a natural way. One can show that the corresponding action of Lie algebra formula_119 is given by the differential operators formula_120 and formula_121 respectively. This explains the commutativity of these operators.\n\nThe following deeper properties actually hold true:\n\n\nThe summands are indexed by the Young diagrams \"D\", and representations formula_127 are mutually non-isomorphic. And diagram formula_128 determine formula_129 and vice versa.\n\n\nOne easily observe the strong similarity to Schur–Weyl duality.\n\nMuch work have been done on the identity and its generalizations. Approximately two dozens of mathematicians and physicists contributed to the subject, to name a few: R. Howe, B. Kostant Fields medalist A. Okounkov A. Sokal, D. Zeilberger.\n\nIt seems historically the first generalizations were obtained by Herbert Westren Turnbull in 1948, who found the generalization for the case of symmetric matrices (see for modern treatments).\n\nThe other generalizations can be divided into several patterns. Most of them are based on the Lie algebra point of view. Such generalizations consist of changing Lie algebra formula_1 to simple Lie algebras and their super (q), and current versions. As well as identity can be generalized for different reductive dual pairs. And finally one can consider not only the determinant of the matrix E, but its permanent, trace of its powers and immanants. Let us mention few more papers; \nstill the list of references is incomplete. It has been believed for quite a long time that the identity is intimately related with semi-simple Lie algebras. Surprisingly a new purely algebraic generalization of the identity have been found in 2008 by S. Caracciolo, A. Sportiello, A. D. Sokal which has nothing to do with any Lie algebras.\n\nConsider \"symmetric\" matrices \n\nHerbert Westren Turnbull in 1948 discovered the following identity:\n\nCombinatorial proof can be found in the paper, another proof and amusing generalizations in the paper, see also discussion below.\n\nConsider \"antisymmetric\" matrices \n\nThen\n\nConsider two matrices \"M\" and \"Y\" over some associative ring which satisfy the following condition\n\nfor some elements \"Q\". Or ”in words”: elements in \"j\"-th column of \"M\" commute with elements in \"k\"-th row of Y unless \"j\" = \"k\", and in this case commutator of the elements \"M\" and \"Y\" depends only on \"i\", \"l\", but does not depend on \"k\".\n\nAssume that \"M\" is a Manin matrix (the simplest example is the matrix with commuting elements).\n\nThen for the square matrix case\n\nHere \"Q\" is a matrix with elements \"Q\", and diag(\"n\" − 1, \"n\" − 2, ..., 1, 0) means the diagonal matrix with the elements \"n\" − 1, \"n\" − 2, ..., 1, 0 on the diagonal.\n\nSee proposition 1.2' formula (1.15) page 4, our \"Y\" is transpose to their \"B\".\n\nObviously the original Cappeli's identity the particular case of this identity. Moreover from this identity one can see that in the original Capelli's identity one can consider elements\n\nfor arbitrary functions \"f\" and the identity still will be true.\n\nConsider matrices \"X\" and \"D\" as in Capelli's identity, i.e. with elements formula_139 and formula_140 at position (\"ij\").\n\nLet \"z\" be another formal variable (commuting with \"x\"). Let \"A\" and \"B\" be some matrices which elements are complex numbers.\n\nHere the first determinant is understood (as always) as column-determinant of a matrix with non-commutative entries. The determinant on the right is calculated as if all the elements commute, and putting all \"x\" and \"z\" on the left, while derivations on the right. (Such recipe is called a Wick ordering in the quantum mechanics).\n\nThe matrix\n\nis a Lax matrix for the Gaudin quantum integrable spin chain system. D. Talalaev solved the long-standing problem of the explicit solution for the full set of the quantum commuting conservation laws for the Gaudin model, discovering the following theorem.\n\nConsider\n\nThen for all \"i,j,z,w\"\n\ni.e. \"H\"(\"z\") are generating functions in \"z\" for the differential operators in \"x\" which all commute. So they provide quantum commuting conservation laws for the Gaudin model.\n\nThe original Capelli identity is a statement about determinants. Later, analogous identities were found for permanents, immanants and traces.\nBased on the combinatorial approach paper by S.G. Williamson \nwas one of the first results in this direction.\n\nConsider the antisymmetric matrices \"X\" and \"D\" with elements \"x\" and corresponding derivations, as in the case of the HUKS identity above.\n\nThen\n\nLet us cite: \"...is stated without proof at the end of Turnbull’s paper\". The authors themselves follow Turnbull – at the very end of their\npaper they write:\n\n\"Since the proof of this last identity is very similar to the proof of Turnbull’s symmetric analog (with a slight twist), we leave it as an instructive and pleasant exercise for the reader.\".\n\nThe identity is deeply analyzed in paper\n\n"}

More formally, given a space \"X\" with a measure \"μ\" and a metric \"d\", one asks for what functions \"f\" : \"X\" → R does\n\nfor all (or at least \"μ\"-almost all) \"x\" ∈ \"X\"? (Here, as in the rest of the article, \"B\"(\"x\") denotes the open ball in \"X\" with \"d\"-radius \"r\" and centre \"x\".) This is a natural question to ask, especially in view of the heuristic construction of the Riemann integral, in which it is almost implicit that \"f\"(\"x\") is a \"good representative\" for the values of \"f\" near \"x\".\n\nOne result on the differentiation of integrals is the Lebesgue differentiation theorem, as proved by Henri Lebesgue in 1910. Consider \"n\"-dimensional Lebesgue measure \"λ\" on \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space R. Then, for any locally integrable function \"f\" : R → R, one has\n\nfor \"λ\"-almost all points \"x\" ∈ R. It is important to note, however, that the measure zero set of \"bad\" points depends on the function \"f\".\n\nThe result for Lebesgue measure turns out to be a special case of the following result, which is based on the Besicovitch covering theorem: if \"μ\" is any locally finite Borel measure on R and \"f\" : R → R is locally integrable with respect to \"μ\", then\n\nfor \"μ\"-almost all points \"x\" ∈ R.\n\nThe problem of the differentiation of integrals is much harder in an infinite-dimensional setting. Consider a separable Hilbert space (\"H\", 〈 , 〉) equipped with a Gaussian measure \"γ\". As stated in the article on the Vitali covering theorem, the Vitali covering theorem fails for Gaussian measures on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Two results of David Preiss (1981 and 1983) show the kind of difficulties that one can expect to encounter in this setting:\n\nHowever, there is some hope if one has good control over the covariance of \"γ\". Let the covariance operator of \"γ\" be \"S\" : \"H\" → \"H\" given by\n\nor, for some countable orthonormal basis (\"e\") of \"H\",\n\nIn 1981, Preiss and Jaroslav Tišer showed that if there exists a constant 0 < \"q\" < 1 such that\n\nthen, for all \"f\" ∈ \"L\"(\"H\", \"γ\"; R),\n\nwhere the convergence is convergence in measure with respect to \"γ\".

{"id": "50263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50263", "title": "Domain of a function", "text": "Domain of a function\n\nIn mathematics, and more specifically in naive set theory, the domain of definition (or simply the domain) of a function is the set of \"input\" or argument values for which the function is defined. That is, the function provides an \"output\" or value for each member of the domain. Conversely, the set of values the function takes on as output is termed the image of the function, which is sometimes also referred to as the range of the function.\n\nFor instance, the domain of cosine is the set of all real numbers, while the domain of the square root consists only of numbers greater than or equal to 0 (ignoring complex numbers in both cases).\n\nIf the domain of a function is a subset of the real numbers and the function is represented in a Cartesian coordinate system, then the domain is represented on the \"X\"-axis.\nGiven a function formula_1, the set formula_2 is the domain of formula_3; the set formula_4 is the codomain of formula_3. In the expression formula_6, formula_7 is the argument and formula_6 is the value. One can think of an argument as a member of the domain that is chosen as an \"input\" to the function, and the value as the \"output\" when the function is applied to that member of the domain.\n\nThe image (sometimes called the range) of formula_3 is the set of all values assumed by formula_3 for all possible formula_7; this is the set formula_12. The image of formula_3 can be the same set as the codomain or it can be a proper subset of it. It is, in general, smaller than the codomain; it is the whole codomain if and only if formula_3 is a surjective function.\n\nA well-defined function must map every element of its domain to an element of its codomain. For example, the function formula_3 defined by\nhas no value for formula_17. Thus, the set of all real numbers, formula_18, cannot be its domain. In cases like this, the function is either defined on formula_19 or the \"gap is plugged\" by explicitly defining formula_17.\nIf we extend the definition of formula_3 to\nthen \"f\" is defined for all real numbers, and its domain is formula_18.\n\nAny function can be restricted to a subset of its domain. The restriction of formula_24 to formula_25, where formula_26, is written formula_27.\n\nThe natural domain of a function is the maximum set of values for which the function is defined, typically within the reals but sometimes among the integers or complex numbers. For instance the natural domain of square root is the non-negative reals when considered as a real number function. When considering a natural domain, the set of possible values of the function is typically called its range.\n\nThere are two distinct meanings in current mathematical usage for the notion of the domain of a partial function from \"X\" to \"Y\", i.e. a function from a subset \"X\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> of \"X\" to \"Y\". Most mathematicians, including recursion theorists, use the term \"domain of \"f\"\" for the set \"X\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> of all values \"x\" such that \"f\"(\"x\") is defined. But some, particularly category theorists, consider the domain to be \"X\", irrespective of whether \"f\"(\"x\") exists for every \"x\" in \"X\".\n\nIn category theory one deals with morphisms instead of functions. Morphisms are arrows from one object to another. The domain of any morphism is the object from which an arrow starts. In this context, many set theoretic ideas about domains must be abandoned or at least formulated more abstractly. For example, the notion of restricting a morphism to a subset of its domain must be modified. See subobject for more.\n\nIn real and complex analysis, a domain is an open connected subset of a real or complex vector space.\n\nIn partial differential equations, a domain is an open connected subset of the Euclidean space formula_28, where the problem is posed, i.e., where the unknown function(s) are defined.\n\n\n"}

Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and \"p\"-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Évariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can not be done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two operations defined on that set: an addition operation written as , and a multiplication operation written as , both of which behave similarly as they behave for rational numbers and real numbers, including the existence of an additive inverse for all elements \"a\", and of a multiplicative inverse \"b\" for every nonzero element \"b\". This allows us to consider also the so-called \"inverse\" operations of subtraction , and division , via defining:\n\nFormally, a field is a set together with two operations called \"addition\" and \"multiplication\". An operation is a mapping that associates an element of the set to \"every\" pair of its elements. The result of the addition of and is called the \"sum\" of and and denoted . Similarly, the result of the multiplication of and is called the \"product\" of and , and denoted or . These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as \"field axioms\". In these axioms, and are arbitrary elements of the field .\n\n\nThis may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called \"addition\" and \"multiplication\"; it is an abelian group under the addition, with 0 as additive identity; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under the multiplication, with 1 as multiplicative identity; the multiplication is distributive over the addition.\n\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and their required properties. Division by zero is, by definition, excluded. In order to avoid existential quantifiers, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses, respectively), and two nullary operations (the constants and ). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in constructive mathematics and computing. One may equivalently define a field by the same two binary operations, one unary operation, (the multiplicative inverse} and two constants 1 and –1, since and .\n\nRational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.\nThey are numbers that can be written as fractions\n, where and are integers, and . The additive inverse of such a fraction is , and the multiplicative inverse (provided that ) is , which can be seen as follows:\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:\n\nThe real numbers , with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The complex numbers consist of expressions\nwhere is the imaginary unit, i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying .\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for . For example, the distributive law enforces\nIt is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the plane, with Cartesian coordinates given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is –less intuitively– combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with compass and straightedge. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle. These problems can be settled using the field of constructible numbers. Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only compass and straightedge. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of square roots of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within . Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments , , and a semicircle over (center at the midpoint ), which intersects the perpendicular line through \"B\" in a point , at a distance of exactly formula_3 from when has length one.\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that formula_4 is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a cube with volume 2, another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called , , , and . The notation is chosen such that plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\nThis field is called a finite field with four elements, and is denoted or . The subset consisting of and (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the \"binary field\" or . In the context of computer science and Boolean algebra, and are often denoted respectively by \"false\" and \"true\", the addition is then denoted XOR (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted AND. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with bits.\n\nIn this section, denotes an arbitrary field and and are arbitrary elements of .\n\nOne has and . In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows .\n\nIf then or must be 0. Indeed, if \"a\" ≠ 0, then \n. This means that every field is an integral domain.\n\nThe axioms of a field imply that it is an abelian group under addition. This group is called the additive group of the field, and is sometimes denoted by when denoting it simply as could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the \"nonzero\" elements of form an abelian group under multiplication, called the multiplicative group, and denoted by or just } or . \n\nA field may thus be defined as set equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that is an abelian group under addition, } is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is distributive over addition. Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of groups. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses and are uniquely determined by .\n\nThe requirement follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0. Thus, the trivial ring, consisting of a single element, is not a field.\n\nEvery finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic (see ).\n\nIn addition to the multiplication of two elements of \"F\", it is possible to define the product of an arbitrary element of by a positive integer to be the -fold sum\n\nIf there is no positive integer such that\nthen is said to have characteristic 0. For example, has characteristic 0 since no positive integer is zero. Otherwise, if there \"is\" a positive integer satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a prime number. It is usually denoted by and the field is said to have characteristic then.\nFor example, the field has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) .\n\nIf has characteristic , then for all in . This implies that \nsince all other binomial coefficients appearing in the binomial formula are divisible by . Here, ( factors) is the -th power, i.e., the -fold product of the element . Therefore, the Frobenius map\nis compatible with the addition in (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism. The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic quite different from fields of characteristic 0.\n\nA \"subfield\" of a field is a subset of that is a field with respect to the field operations of . Equivalently is a subset of that contains , and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that , that for all both and are in , and that for all in , both and are in .\n\nField homomorphisms are maps between two fields such that , , and , where and are arbitrary elements of . All field homomorphisms are injective. If is also surjective, it is called an isomorphism (or the fields and are called isomorphic).\n\nA field is called a prime field if it has no proper (i.e., strictly smaller) subfields. Any field contains a prime field. If the characteristic of is (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field introduced below. Otherwise the prime field is isomorphic to .\n\n\"Finite fields\" (also called \"Galois fields\") are fields with finitely many elements, whose number is also referred to as the order of the field. The above introductory example is a field with four elements. Its subfield is the smallest field, because by definition a field has at least two distinct elements 1 ≠ 0.\nThe simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using modular arithmetic. For a fixed positive integer , arithmetic \"modulo \" means to work with the numbers\nThe addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set of integers, dividing by and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if is a prime number. For example, taking the prime results in the above-mentioned field . For and more generally, for any composite number (i.e., any number which can be expressed as a product of two strictly smaller natural numbers), is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since in , which, as was explained above, prevents from being a field. The field with elements ( being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by .\n\nEvery finite field has elements, where is prime and . This statement holds since may be viewed as a vector space over its prime field. The dimension of this vector space is necessarily finite, say , which implies the asserted statement.\n\nA field with elements can be constructed as the splitting field of the polynomial \nSuch a splitting field is an extension of in which the polynomial has zeros. This means has as many zeros as possible since the degree of is . For , it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of satisfy the equation , so they are zeros of . By contrast, in , has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic. It is thus customary to speak of \"the\" finite field with elements, denoted by or .\n\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry. A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who observed that permuting the zeros of a cubic polynomial in the expression\n(with being a third root of unity) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of Scipione del Ferro and François Viète, which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown to an quadratic equation for . Together with a similar observation for equations of degree 4, Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups. Vandermonde, also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, Carl Friedrich Gauss, in his \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" (1801), studied the equation\nfor a prime and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic Galois group. Gauss deduced that a regular -gon can be constructed if . Building on Lagrange's work, Paolo Ruffini claimed (1799) that quintic equations (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by Niels Henrik Abel in 1824. Évariste Galois, in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as Galois theory today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an algebraic number field, but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 Richard Dedekind introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the German word \"Körper\", which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by .\n\nIn 1881 Leopold Kronecker defined what he called a \"domain of rationality\", which is a field of rational fractions in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as abstractly as the rational function field . Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since Joseph Liouville's work in 1844, until Charles Hermite (1873) and Ferdinand von Lindemann (1882) proved the transcendence of and , respectively.\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to . In particular, Heinrich Martin Weber's notion included the field F. Giuseppe Veronese (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led to introduce the field of \"p\"-adic numbers. synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections Galois theory, Constructing fields and Elementary notions can be found in Steinitz's work. linked the notion of orderings in a field, and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties. Emil Artin redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the primitive element theorem.\n\nA commutative ring is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses . For example, the integers form a commutative ring, but not a field: the reciprocal of an integer is not itself an integer, unless .\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings in which every nonzero element is a unit (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are the commutative rings with precisely two distinct ideals, and . Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which is the only prime ideal.\n\nGiven a commutative ring , there are two ways to construct a field related to , i.e., two ways of modifying such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of is , the rationals, while the residue fields of are the finite fields .\n\nGiven an integral domain , its field of fractions is built with the fractions of two elements of exactly as Q is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of are the fractions where and are in , and . Two fractions and are equal if and only if . The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.\n\nThe field of the rational fractions over a field (or an integral domain) is the field of fractions of the polynomial ring . The field of Laurent series\nover a field is the field of fractions of the ring of formal power series (in which ). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\nIn addition the field of fractions, which embeds injectively into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring by means of a surjective map onto a field . Any field obtained in this way is a quotient , where is a maximal ideal of . If has only one maximal ideal , this field is called the residue field of .\n\nThe ideal generated by a single polynomial in the polynomial ring (over a field \"E\") is maximal if and only if is irreducible in , i.e., if can not be expressed as the product of two polynomials in of smaller degree. This yields a field\nThis field contains an element (namely the residue class of ) which satisfies the equation\nFor example, is obtained from by adjoining the imaginary unit symbol i, which satisfies , where . Moreover, is irreducible over , which implies that the map that sends a polynomial to yields an isomorphism\n\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field , and a field containing as a subfield. For any element of , there is a smallest subfield of containing and , called the subfield of \"F\" generated by and denoted . The passage from to is referred to by \"adjoining an element\" to \"E\". More generally, for a subset , there is a minimal subfield of containing and , denoted by .\n\nThe compositum of two subfields and of some field is the smallest subfield of containing both and The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of , which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over .\n\nThe notion of a subfield can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to being a \"field extension\" (or just extension) of , denoted by\nand read \" over \".\n\nA basic datum of a field extension is its degree , i.e., the dimension of as an -vector space. It satisfies the formula\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions and are of degree 2, whereas is an infinite extension.\n\nA pivotal notion in the study of field extensions are algebraic elements. An element is \"algebraic\" over if it is a root of a polynomial with coefficients in , that is, if it satisfies a polynomial equation\nwith in , and . \nFor example, the imaginary unit in is algebraic over , and even over , since it satisfies the equation\nA field extension in which every element of is algebraic over is called an algebraic extension. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.\n\nThe subfield generated by an element , as above, is an algebraic extension of if and only if is an algebraic element. That is to say, if is algebraic, all other elements of are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension , i.e., the dimension of as an -vector space, equals the minimal degree such that there is a polynomial equation involving , as above. If this degree is , then the elements of have the form \n\nFor example, the field of Gaussian rationals is the subfield of consisting of all numbers of the form where both and are rational numbers: summands of the form (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since can be simplified to .\n\nThe above-mentioned field of rational fractions , where is an indeterminate, is not an algebraic extension of since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in whose zero is . Elements, such as , which are not algebraic are called transcendental. Informally speaking, the indeterminate and its powers do not interact with elements of . A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension discussed above is a key example: if is not algebraic (i.e., is not a root of a polynomial with coefficients in ), then is isomorphic to . This isomorphism is obtained by substituting to in rational fractions.\n\nA subset of a field is a transcendence basis if it is algebraically independent (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over and if is an algebraic extension of . Any field extension has a transcendence basis. Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form (purely transcendental extensions) and algebraic extensions.\n\nA field is algebraically closed if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any polynomial equation\nhas a solution . By the fundamental theorem of algebra, is algebraically closed, i.e., \"any\" polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are \"not\" algebraically closed since the equation\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing is called an \"algebraic closure\" of if it is algebraic over (roughly speaking, not too big compared to ) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above, is an algebraic closure of . The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field is quite special: by the Artin-Schreier theorem, the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and is elementarily equivalent to . Such fields are also known as real closed fields.\n\nAny field has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as \"the\" algebraic closure and denoted . For example, the algebraic closure of is called the field of algebraic numbers. The field is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the ultrafilter lemma, a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the axiom of choice. In this regard, the algebraic closure of , is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing (the ones of order ). For any algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field of Laurent series is the field of Puiseux series, obtained by adjoining roots of .\n\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.\n\nA field \"F\" is called an \"ordered field\" if any two elements can be compared, so that and whenever and . For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering ≥. The Artin-Schreier theorem states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a formally real field, which means that any quadratic equation\nonly has the solution . The set of all possible orders on a fixed field \"F\" is isomorphic to the set of ring homomorphisms from the Witt ring W(\"F\") of quadratic forms over \"F\", to Z.\n\nAn Archimedean field is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements. Equivalently, the field contains no infinitesimals (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of .\nAn ordered field is Dedekind-complete if all upper bounds, lower bounds (see Dedekind cut) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each bounded subset of is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean, since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence , every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism. Several foundational results in calculus follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe hyperreals form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of non-standard analysis.\n\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a topological field, in which the set \"F\" is a topological space, such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps and ) are continuous maps with respect to the topology of the space.\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a metric, i.e., a function\nthat measures a \"distance\" between any two elements of .\n\nThe completion of is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field are filled, if there are any. For example, any irrational number , such as , is a \"gap\" in the rationals in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers , in the sense that distance of and given by the absolute value is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero sequence, i.e., a sequence whose limit (for ) is zero.\n\nThe field is used in number theory and -adic analysis. The algebraic closure carries a unique norm extending the one on , but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is called the field of complex p-adic numbers and is denoted by .\n\nThe following topological fields are called \"local fields\":\n\nThese two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities. In this relation, the elements and (referred to as uniformizer) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in . (However, since the addition in is done using carrying, which is not the case in , these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n\nDifferential fields are fields equipped with a derivation, i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field. For example, the field R(\"X\"), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to differential Galois theory, a variant of Galois theory dealing with linear differential equations.\n\nGalois theory studies algebraic extensions of a field by studying the symmetry in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are finite Galois extensions , which are, by definition, those that are separable and normal. The primitive element theorem shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily simple, i.e., of the form\nwhere is an irreducible polynomial (as above). For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of are contained in and that has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the Galois group is the group of field automorphisms of that are trivial on (i.e., the bijections that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, which constructs an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the set of subgroups of and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension . By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not solvable (can not be built from abelian groups), then the zeros of can \"not\" be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving formula_11. For example, the symmetric groups is not solvable for . Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the Abel–Ruffini theorem:\n\nThe tensor product of fields is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension of degree is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of -algebras\nThis fact is the beginning of Grothendieck's Galois theory, a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.\n\nBasic invariants of a field include the characteristic and the transcendence degree of over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields and are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree. This implies that any two uncountable algebraically closed fields of the same cardinality and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, and are isomorphic (but \"not\" isomorphic as topological fields).\n\nIn model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, two fields and are called elementarily equivalent if every mathematical statement that is true for is also true for and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be first-order sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\nThe Lefschetz principle states that is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement holds in if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.\n\nIf is an ultrafilter on a set , and is a field for every in , the ultraproduct of the with respect to is a field. It is denoted by\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields : Łoś's theorem states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many , also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence , this shows that there is an isomorphism\nThe Ax–Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes )\nIn addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as real closed fields or exponential fields (which are equipped with an exponential function ).\n\nFor fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the absolute Galois group is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs \"all\" finite separable extensions of . By elementary means, the group can be shown to be the Prüfer group, the profinite completion of . This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of are the fields for , and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of -adic number fields (finite extensions of ).\n\nRepresentations of Galois groups and of related groups such as the Weil group are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the Langlands program. The cohomological study of such representations is done using Galois cohomology. For example, the Brauer group, which is classically defined as the group of central simple -algebras, can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely\n\nMilnor K-theory is defined as\nThe norm residue isomorphism theorem, proved around 2000 by Vladimir Voevodsky, relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism\nAlgebraic K-theory is related to the group of invertible matrices with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the determinant of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K(\"F\") = \"F\". Matsumoto's theorem shows that K(\"F\") agrees with K(\"F\"). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.\n\nIf , then the equation \nhas a unique solution in , namely . This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any vector space has a basis. Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in linear algebra both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.\n\nModules (the analogue of vector spaces) over most rings, including the ring of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring is a vector space over a field in its own right. Such rings are called -algebras and are studied in depth in the area of commutative algebra. For example, Noether normalization asserts that any finitely generated -algebra is closely related to (more precisely, finitely generated as a module over) a polynomial ring .\n\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\nin a (large) finite field can be performed much more efficiently than the discrete logarithm, which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution to an equation\nIn elliptic curve cryptography, the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an elliptic curve, i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n\nFinite fields are also used in coding theory and combinatorics.\n\nFunctions on a suitable topological space into a field can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:\nThis makes these functions a -commutative algebra.\n\nFor having a \"field\" of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are integral domains. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form\nform a field, called field of functions.\n\nThis occurs in two main cases. When is a complex manifold . In this case, one considers the algebra of holomorphic functions, i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of meromorphic functions on .\n\nThe function field of an algebraic variety (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of regular functions, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the -dimensional space over a field is , i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in indeterminates. The function field of is the same as the one of any open dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field is invariant under isomorphism and birational equivalence of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of abstract algebraic varieties and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the dimension, which equals the transcendence degree of , is invariant under birational equivalence. For curves (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field is very close to : if is smooth and proper (the analogue of being compact), can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions. In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about . The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as birational geometry. The minimal model program attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\nGlobal fields are in the limelight in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry.\nThey are, by definition, number fields (finite extensions of ) or function fields over (finite extensions of ). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This function field analogy can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the Riemann hypothesis concerning the zeros of the Riemann zeta function (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the Weil conjectures (proven in 1974 by Pierre Deligne).\nCyclotomic fields are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form , where is a primitive -th root of unity, i.e., a complex number satisfying and for all . For being a regular prime, Kummer used cyclotomic fields to prove Fermat's last theorem, which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. Ostrowski's theorem asserts that the only completions of , a global field, are the local fields and . Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the local-global principle. For example, the Hasse–Minkowski theorem reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in and , whose solutions can easily be described.\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. Inverse Galois theory studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group for some number field . Class field theory describes the abelian extensions, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the Kronecker–Weber theorem, describes the maximal abelian extension of : it is the field\nobtained by adjoining all primitive -th roots of unity. Kronecker's Jugendtraum asks for a similarly explicit description of of general number fields . For imaginary quadratic fields, formula_16, , the theory of complex multiplication describes using elliptic curves. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 ≠ 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of field with one element, which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields , as tends to 1. In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as quasifields, near-fields and semifields.\n\nThere are also proper classes with field structure, which are sometimes called Fields, with a capital F. The surreal numbers form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The nimbers, a concept from game theory form a Field.\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a \"division ring\" or \"skew field\". The only division rings that are finite-dimensional -vector spaces are itself, (which is a field), the quaternions (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the octonions (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative).

One also says that \"X\" is finite over \"Y\".\n\nIn fact, \"f\" is finite if and only if for \"every\" open affine open subscheme \"V\" = Spec \"B\" in \"Y\", the inverse image of \"V\" in \"X\" is affine, of the form Spec \"A\", with \"A\" a finitely generated \"B\"-module.\n\nFor example, for any field \"k\", formula_4is a finite morphism since formula_5 as formula_6-modules. Geometrically, this is obviously finite since this a ramified n-sheeted cover of the affine line which degenerates at the origin. By contrast, the inclusion of \"A\" − 0 into \"A\" is not finite. (Indeed, the Laurent polynomial ring \"k\"[\"y\", \"y\"] is not finitely generated as a module over \"k\"[\"y\"].) This restricts our geometric intuition to surjective families with finite fibers.\n\n\nFor a homomorphism \"A\" → \"B\" of commutative rings, \"B\" is called an \"A\"-algebra of finite type if \"B\" is a finitely generated as an \"A\"-algebra. It is much stronger for \"B\" to be a finite \"A\"-algebra, which means that \"B\" is finitely generated as an \"A\"-module. For example, for any commutative ring \"A\" and natural number \"n\", the polynomial ring \"A\"[\"x\", ..., \"x\"] is an \"A\"-algebra of finite type, but it is not a finite \"A\"-algebra unless \"A\" = 0 or \"n\" = 0. Another example of a finite-type morphism which is not finite is formula_7.\n\nThe analogous notion in terms of schemes is: a morphism \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\" of schemes is of finite type if \"Y\" has a covering by affine open subschemes \"V\" = Spec \"A\" such that \"f\"(\"V\") has a finite covering by affine open subschemes \"U\" = Spec \"B\" with \"B\" an \"A\"-algebra of finite type.

Likewise, every projective scheme \"X\" over a field has a finite surjective morphism to projective space P, where \"n\" is the dimension of \"X\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16258342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16258342", "title": "Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)", "text": "Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)\n\nIn foundations of mathematics, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of logic, formalism is a theory that holds that statements of mathematics and logic can be considered to be statements about the consequences of certain string manipulation rules.\n\nFor example, Euclidean geometry can be considered a game whose play consists in moving around certain strings of symbols called axioms according to a set of rules called \"rules of inference\" to generate new strings. In playing this game one can \"prove\" that the Pythagorean theorem is valid because the string representing the Pythagorean theorem can be constructed using only the stated rules.\n\nAccording to formalism, the truths expressed in logic and mathematics are not about numbers, sets, or triangles or any other contensive subject matter — in fact, they aren't \"about\" anything at all. They are syntactic forms whose shapes and locations have no meaning unless they are given an interpretation (or semantics).\n\nFormalism is associated with rigorous method. In common use, a \"formalism\" means the out-turn of the effort towards formalisation of a given limited area. In other words, matters can be formally discussed once captured in a formal system, or commonly enough within something \"formalisable\" with claims to be one. Complete formalisation is in the domain of computer science.\n\nFormalism stresses axiomatic proofs using theorems, specifically associated with David Hilbert. A formalist is an individual who belongs to the school of formalism, which is a certain mathematical-philosophical doctrine descending from Hilbert.\n\nFormalists are relatively tolerant and inviting to new approaches to logic, non-standard number systems, new set theories, etc. The more games they study, the better. However, in all three of these examples, motivation is drawn from existing mathematical or philosophical concerns. The \"games\" are usually not arbitrary.\n\nRecently, some formalist mathematicians have proposed that all \"formal\" mathematical knowledge should be systematically encoded in computer-readable formats, in order to facilitate automated proof checking of mathematical proofs and the use of interactive theorem proving in the development of mathematical theories and computer software. Because of their close connection with computer science, this idea is also advocated by mathematical intuitionists and constructivists in the \"computability\" tradition.\n\nAnother version of formalism is often known as deductivism. In deductivism, the Pythagorean theorem is not an absolute truth, but a relative one.\n\nThis is to say, that \"if\" you interpret the strings in such a way that the rules of the game become true \"then\" you have to accept that the theorem, or, rather, the interpretation of the theorem you have given it must be a true statement. (The rules of such a game would have to include, for instance, that true statements are assigned to the axioms, and that the rules of inference are truth-preserving, etcetera.)\n\nUnder deductivism, the same view is held to be true for all other statements of formal logic and mathematics. Thus, formalism need not mean that these deductive sciences are nothing more than meaningless symbolic games. It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold. Compare this position to structuralism.\n\nTaking the deductivist view allows the working mathematician to suspend judgement on the deep philosophical questions and proceed as if solid epistemological foundations were available. Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied are suggested by the demands of the particular science.\n\nA major early proponent of formalism was David Hilbert, whose program was intended to be a complete and consistent axiomatization of all of mathematics. Hilbert aimed to show the consistency of mathematical systems from the assumption that the \"finitary arithmetic\" (a subsystem of the usual arithmetic of the positive integers, chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial) was consistent (i.e. no contradictions can be derived from the system).\n\nThe way that Hilbert tried to show that an axiomatic system was consistent was by formalizing it using a particular language (Snapper, 1979). In order to formalize an axiomatic system, you must first choose a language in which you can express and perform operations within that system. This language must include five components:\n\n\nOnce we choose this language, Hilbert thought that we could prove all theorems within any axiomatic system using nothing more than the axioms themselves and the chosen formal language.\n\nGödel's conclusion in his incompleteness theorems was that you cannot prove consistency within any axiomatic system rich enough to include classical arithmetic. On the one hand, you must use only the formal language chosen to formalize this axiomatic system; on the other hand, it is impossible to prove the consistency of this language in itself (Snapper, 1979). Hilbert was originally frustrated by Gödel's work because it shattered his life's goal to completely formalize everything in number theory (Reid and Weyl, 1970). However, Gödel did not feel that he contradicted everything about Hilbert's formalist point of view. After Gödel published his work, it became apparent that proof theory still had some use, the only difference is that it could not be used to prove the consistency of all of number theory as Hilbert had hoped (Reid and Weyl, 1970). Present-day formalists use proof theory to further our understanding in mathematics, but perhaps because of Gödel's work, they make no claims about semantic meaning in the work that they do with mathematics. Proofs are simply the manipulation of symbols in our formal language starting from certain rules that we call axioms.\n\nIt is important to note that Hilbert is not considered a strict formalist as formalism is defined today. He thought there was some meaning and truth in mathematics, which is precisely why he was trying to prove the consistency of number theory. If number theory turned out to be consistent, then there had to be some sort of truth in it (Goodman, 1979). Strict formalists consider mathematics apart from its semantic meaning. They view mathematics as pure syntax: the manipulation of symbols according to certain rules. They then attempt to show that this set of rules is consistent, much like Hilbert attempted to do (Goodman, 1979). Formalists currently believe that computerized algorithms will eventually take over the task of constructing proofs. Computers will replace humans in all mathematical activities, such as checking to see if a proof is correct or not (Goodman, 1979).\n\nHilbert was initially a deductivist, but, he considered certain metamathematical methods to yield intrinsically meaningful results and was a realist with respect to the finitary arithmetic. Later, he held the opinion that there was no other meaningful mathematics whatsoever, regardless of interpretation.\n\nOther formalists, such as Rudolf Carnap, Alfred Tarski and Haskell Curry, considered mathematics to be the investigation of formal axiom systems. Mathematical logicians study formal systems but are just as often realists as they are formalists.\n\nPerhaps the most serious attempt to formalize number theory was by the two mathematicians Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead. They created a work, \"Principia Mathematica\", which derived number theory by the manipulation of symbols using formal logic. This work was very detailed, and they spent the better part of a decade in writing it. It was not until page 379 of the first volume that they attempted to prove that 1+1=2. \n\nRussell's philosophy of mathematics was not formalist, however; it is usually considered a form of logicism. He strongly criticized Hilbert's formalism.\n\nGödel indicated one of the weak points of formalism by addressing the question of consistency in axiomatic systems. More recent criticisms lie in the assertion of formalists that it is possible to computerize all of mathematics. These criticisms bring up the philosophical question of whether or not computers are able to think. Turing tests, named after Alan Turing, who created the test, are an attempt to provide criteria for judging when a computer is capable of thought. The existence of a computer which in principle could pass a Turing test would prove to formalists that computers will be able to do all of mathematics. However, there are opponents of this claim, such as John Searle, who came up with the \"Chinese room\" thought experiment. He presented the argument that while a computer may be able to manipulate the symbols that we give it, the machine could attach no meaning to these symbols. Since computers will not be able to deal with semantic content in mathematics (Penrose, 1989), they could not be said to \"think.\"\n\nFurther, humans can create several ways to prove the same result, even if they might find it challenging to articulate such methods. Since creativity requires thought having a semantic foundation, a computer would not be able to create different methods of solving the same problem. Indeed, a formalist would not be able to say that these other ways of solving problems exist simply because they have not been formalized (Goodman, 1979).\n\nAnother critique of formalism is that the actual mathematical ideas that occupy mathematicians are far removed from the string manipulation games mentioned above. Formalism is thus silent to the question of which axiom systems ought to be studied, as none is more meaningful than another from a formalistic point of view.\n\n\n"}

Generalized inverses can be defined in any mathematical structure that involves associative multiplication, that is, in a semigroup. This article describes generalized inverses of a matrix formula_1.\n\nFormally, given a matrix formula_2 and a matrix formula_3, formula_4 is a generalized inverse of formula_1 if it satisfies the condition formula_6.\n\nThe purpose of constructing a generalized inverse of a matrix is to obtain a matrix that can serve as an inverse in some sense for a wider class of matrices than invertible matrices. A generalized inverse exists for an arbitrary matrix, and when a matrix has a regular inverse, this inverse is its unique generalized inverse.\n\nConsider the linear system\n\nwhere formula_1 is an formula_9 matrix and formula_10, the column space of formula_1. If formula_1 is nonsingular (which implies formula_13) then formula_14 will be the solution of the system. Note that, if formula_1 is nonsingular, then\n\nNow suppose formula_1 is rectangular (formula_18), or square and singular. Then we need a right candidate formula_19 of order formula_20 such that for all formula_10,\n\nThat is, formula_23 is a solution of the linear system formula_7. \nEquivalently, we need a matrix formula_19 of order formula_26 such that\n\nHence we can define the generalized inverse or g-inverse as follows: Given an formula_9 matrix formula_1, an formula_20 matrix formula_19 is said to be a generalized inverse of formula_1 if formula_27 The matrix formula_34 has been termed a regular inverse of formula_1 by some authors.\n\nThe Penrose conditions define different generalized inverses for formula_2 and formula_37\n\n\nwhere formula_42 indicates conjugate transpose. If formula_4 satisfies the first condition, then it is a generalized inverse of formula_1. If it satisfies the first two conditions, then it is a reflexive generalized inverse of formula_1. If it satisfies all four conditions, then it is the pseudoinverse of formula_1. A pseudoinverse is sometimes called the Moore–Penrose inverse, after the pioneering works by E. H. Moore and Roger Penrose. \n\nWhen formula_1 is non-singular, any generalized inverse formula_48 and is unique, but in all other cases, there are an infinite number of matrices that satisfy condition (1). However, the Moore–Penrose inverse is unique.\n\nThere are other kinds of generalized inverse:\n\n\nLet\n\nSince formula_68, formula_69 is singular and has no regular inverse. However, formula_69 and formula_71 satisfy conditions (1) and (2), but not (3) or (4). Hence, formula_71 is a reflexive generalized inverse of formula_69.\n\nLet\n\nSince formula_69 is not square, formula_69 has no regular inverse. However, formula_77 is a right inverse of formula_69. The matrix formula_69 has no left inverse.\n\nThe following characterizations are easy to verify:\n\nAny generalized inverse can be used to determine whether a system of linear equations has any solutions, and if so to give all of them. If any solutions exist for the \"n\" × \"m\" linear system\n\nwith vector formula_81 of unknowns and vector formula_82 of constants, all solutions are given by \n\nparametric on the arbitrary vector formula_84, where formula_4 is any generalized inverse of formula_1. Solutions exist if and only if formula_87 is a solution, that is, if and only if formula_88. If \"A\" has full column rank, the bracketed expression in this equation is the zero matrix and so the solution is unique.\n\nIn practical applications it is necessary to identify the class of matrix transformations that must be preserved by a generalized inverse. For example, the Moore-Penrose inverse, formula_89, satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to transformations involving unitary matrices \"U\" and \"V\":\n\nThe Drazin inverse, formula_91 satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to similarity transformations involving a nonsingular matrix \"S\":\n\nThe Unit-Consistent (UC) inverse, formula_93, satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to transformations involving nonsingular diagonal matrices \"D\" and \"E\":\n\nThe fact that the Moore-Penrose inverse provides consistency with respect to rotations (which are orthonormal transformations) explains its widespread use in physics and other applications in which Euclidean distances must be preserved. The UC inverse, by contrast, is applicable when system behavior is expected to be invariant with respect to the choice of units on different state variables, e.g., miles versus kilometers.\n\n\n"}

In particular, it does not designate a constant or a parameter of the problem, it is not an unknown that could be solved for, and it is not a variable designating a function argument or being summed or integrated over; it is not any type of bound variable.\n\nA polynomial in an indeterminate \"X\" is an expression of the form formula_1, where the \"a\" are called the coefficients of the polynomial. Two such polynomials are equal only if the corresponding coefficients are equal. In contrast, two polynomial functions in a variable \"x\" may be equal or not depending on the value of \"x\".\n\nFor example, the functions\nare equal when \"x\" = 3 and not equal otherwise. But the two polynomials\nare unequal, since 2 does not equal 5, and 3 does not equal 2. In fact,\ndoes not hold \"unless\" \"a\" = 2 and \"b\" = 3. This is because \"X\" is not, and does not designate, a number.\n\nThe distinction is subtle, since a polynomial in \"X\" can be changed to a function in \"x\" by substitution. But the distinction is important because information may be lost when this substitution is made. Working in modulo 2:\nso the polynomial function \"x\" − \"x\" is identically equal to 0 for \"x\" having any value in the modulo-2 system. But the polynomial \"X\" − \"X\" is not the zero polynomial, since the coefficients, 0, 1 and −1, are not all zero.\n\nA formal power series in an indeterminate \"X\" is an expression of the form \"a\" + \"a\"\"X\" + \"a\"\"X\" + …. This is similar to the definition of a polynomial, except that an infinite number of the coefficients may be nonzero. Unlike the power series encountered in calculus, questions of convergence are irrelevant. So power series that would diverge for values of \"x\", such as 1 + \"x\" + 2\"x\" + 6\"x\" + … + \"n\"!\"x\" + …, are allowed.\n\nIndeterminates are useful in abstract algebra for generating mathematical structures. For example, given a field \"K\", the set of polynomials with coefficients in \"K\" is the polynomial ring with polynomial addition and multiplication as operations. If two indeterminates \"X\" and \"Y\" are used, the polynomial ring \"K\"[\"X,Y\"] also uses these operations, and convention holds that \"XY\" = \"YX\".\n\nIndeterminates may also be used to generate a free algebra over a commutative ring \"A\". For instance, with two indeterminates \"X\" and \"Y\", the free algebra \"A\"⟨\"X,Y\"⟩ includes sums of strings in \"X\" and \"Y\", with coefficients in \"A\", and with the stipulation that \"XY\" and \"YX\" are distinct.\n\n"}

In \"Logical Investigations\", which resulted from a shift in Husserl's interests from mathematics to logic and epistemology, Husserl maintains that mathematical laws are not empirical laws that describe the workings of the mind, but ideal laws whose necessity is intuited \"a priori\". Though Husserl abandoned psychologism, the doctrine according to which logical entities such as propositions, universals, and numbers can be reduced to mental states or activities, in \"Logical Investigations\", some commentators have seen a revival of psychologism in its second volume. \"Logical Investigations\" helped to create phenomenology, and has been credited with making twentieth century continental philosophy possible. Martin Heidegger was among the philosophers influenced by the work. An English translation of the second edition, by the philosopher J. N. Findlay, was published in 1970.\n\nBetween 1890 and 1900, Husserl's philosophical interests expanded from mathematics to a concern with logic and epistemology. \"Logical Investigations\" was the culmination of this development. In this work, Husserl gave a new account of mathematics, one opposed to his previous views, which had been influenced by the psychologism of the late 19th century. Husserl's view in \"Logical Investigations\", which may have been influenced by Gottlob Frege's criticism of Husserl's \"Philosophy of Arithmetic\" (1891), was that mathematical laws are not empirical laws that describe the workings of the mind, but ideal laws whose necessity is intuited \"a priori\".\n\nHusserl's first major work, \"Logical Investigations\" has been credited with making twentieth century continental philosophy possible. According to Donn Welton, Husserl introduced a novel conception of the relationships between language and experience, meaning and reference, and subject and object, and by attempting to integrate a theory of meaning with a theory of truth, and a theory of the subject with a theory of the object, helped create phenomenology, a new form of philosophy that went beyond systems such as psychologism, formalism, realism, idealism, objectivism and subjectivism. Martin Heidegger studied \"Logical Investigations\" while a student at the , where they were so rarely requested from the university library that Heidegger was easily able to renew them. Heidegger had expected that \"Logical Investigations\" would, like Carl Braig's \"On Being\" and other works Heidegger had already studied, shed light on the multiple meanings of being, but he was disappointed. Nevertheless, the work impressed Heidegger and convinced him to study philosophy. Especially important for Heidegger was the sixth of the \"Logical Investigations\", in which Husserl distinguishes between \"sensuous\" and \"categorical\" intuition. Heidegger, like Theodor W. Adorno, believed that the second volume of \"Logical Investigations\" marked an apparent revival of psychologism, which puzzled him. In \"Being and Time\" (1927), Heidegger credited Husserl's \"Logical Investigations\" with making his work possible.\n\nThe German philosopher Emil Lask was also influenced by \"Logical Investigations\". Heidegger credited Lask with being the only person who had taken up Husserl's investigations \"positively from outside the mainstream of phenomenological research\", pointing to Lask's \"Die Logik der Philosophie und die Kategorienlehre\" (1911) and \"Die Lehre vom Urteil\" (1912). Jacques Derrida, who studied Husserl's \"Logical Investigations\" as a student in the 1950s, offered a critique of Husserl's work in \"Speech and Phenomena\" (1967). Judith Butler, writing in the preface to the second edition of \"Subjects of Desire\" (1987; second edition 1999), commented that \"a grammar that is preconceived to express logical relations\" is the \"conceit\" of \"Logical Investigations\", which she compared to the early work of Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nRobert Sokolowski, writing in \"The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy\" (1995), criticized the first edition of \"Logical Investigations\" for sharply distinguishing between things as they appear and the thing in itself, a view similar to that of Immanuel Kant. Sokolowski notes that between 1900 and 1910, Husserl abandoned the Kantian distinctions made in \"Logical Investigations\". According to Sokolowski, when Husserl expressed a new position in \"Ideas\" (1913), he was misinterpreted as adopting a traditional idealism and \"many thinkers who admired Husserl's earlier work distanced themselves from what he now taught.\" Derrida's biographer Jason Powell described the analyses of signs and meaning in \"Logical Investigations\" as \"rigorous and abstract\", \"scrupulous\", but also \"tedious\". The philosopher Ray Monk wrote that \"Logical Investigations\" is \"made almost impenetrable by the obscurity of Husserl’s prose\", adding that Bertrand Russell described trying to read the work as \"very much like trying to swallow a whale\".\n\nThe A numbers used as standard references refer to the page numbers of the first edition of the \"Logische Untersuchungen\" (1900/01), while the B numbers refer to the page numbers of the second edition.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37749", "title": "Marquis de Condorcet", "text": "Marquis de Condorcet\n\nMarie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis of Condorcet (; 17 September 1743 – 29 March 1794), known as Nicolas de Condorcet, was a French philosopher and mathematician. His ideas, including support for a liberal economy, free and equal public instruction, constitutional government, and equal rights for women and people of all races, have been said to embody the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment and Enlightenment rationalism. He died in prison after a period of flight from French Revolutionary authorities.\n\nCondorcet was born in Ribemont (in present-day Aisne), descended from the ancient family of Caritat, who took their title from the town of Condorcet in Dauphiné, of which they were long-time residents. Fatherless at a young age, he was raised by his devoutly religious mother. He was educated at the Jesuit College in Reims and at the \"Collège de Navarre\" in Paris, where he quickly showed his intellectual ability and gained his first public distinctions in mathematics. When he was sixteen, his analytical abilities gained the praise of Jean le Rond d'Alembert and Alexis Clairaut; soon, Condorcet would study under d'Alembert.\n\nFrom 1765 to 1774, he focused on science. In 1765, he published his first work on mathematics, entitled \"Essai sur le calcul intégral\", which was well received, launching his career as a mathematician. He went on to publish more papers, and on 25 February 1769, he was elected to the \"Académie royale des Sciences\".\nIn 1772, he published another paper on integral calculus. Soon after, he met Jacques Turgot, a French economist, and the two became friends. Turgot became an administrator under King Louis XV in 1772 and Controller-General of Finance under Louis XVI in 1774.\n\nCondorcet worked with Leonhard Euler and Benjamin Franklin. He soon became an honorary member of many foreign academies and philosophic societies, including the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1785), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1792),\nand also in Prussia and Russia\n\nHis political ideas, many in congruity with Turgot's, were criticized heavily in the English-speaking world, however, most notably by John Adams who wrote two of his principal works of political philosophy to oppose Turgot's and Condorcet's unicameral legislature and radical democracy.\n\nIn 1774, Condorcet was appointed inspector general of the Paris mint by Turgot. From this point on, Condorcet shifted his focus from the purely mathematical to philosophy and political matters. In the following years, he took up the defense of human rights in general, and of women's and Blacks' rights in particular (an abolitionist, he became active in the Society of the Friends of the Blacks in the 1780s). He supported the ideals embodied by the newly formed United States, and proposed projects of political, administrative and economic reforms intended to transform France.\n\nIn 1776, Turgot was dismissed as Controller General. Consequently, Condorcet submitted his resignation as Inspector General of the \"Monnaie\", but the request was refused, and he continued serving in this post until 1791. Condorcet later wrote \"Vie de M. Turgot\" (1786), a biography which spoke fondly of Turgot and advocated Turgot's economic theories. Condorcet continued to receive prestigious appointments: in 1777, he became Permanent Secretary of the Académie des Sciences, holding the post until the abolition of the Académie in 1793; and, in 1782, secretary of the \"Académie française\".\n\nIn 1785, Condorcet wrote an essay on the application of analysis of the probability of decisions made on a majority vote, one of his most important works. This work described several now famous results, including Condorcet's jury theorem, which states that if each member of a voting group is more likely than not to make a correct decision, the probability that the highest vote of the group is the correct decision increases as the number of members of the group increases, and Condorcet's paradox, which shows that majority preferences can become intransitive with three or more options – it is possible for a certain electorate to express a preference for A over B, a preference for B over C, and a preference for C over A, all from the same set of ballots.\n\nThe paper also outlines a generic Condorcet method, designed to simulate pair-wise elections between all candidates in an election. He disagreed strongly with the alternative method of aggregating preferences put forth by Jean-Charles de Borda (based on summed rankings of alternatives). Condorcet was one of the first to systematically apply mathematics in the social sciences.\n\nIn 1781, Condorcet wrote a pamphlet, \"Reflections on Negro Slavery\", in which he denounced slavery. In 1786, Condorcet worked on ideas for the differential and integral calculus, giving a new treatment of infinitesimals – a work which was never printed. In 1789, he published \"Vie de Voltaire (1789)\", which agreed with Voltaire in his opposition to the Church. In 1791, Condorcet, along with Sophie de Grouchy, Thomas Paine, Etienne Dumont, Jacques-Pierre Brissot, and Achilles Duchastellet published a brief journal titled \"Le Républicain\", its main goal being the promotion of republicanism and the rejection of constitutional monarchy. The journal's theme was that any sort of monarchy is a threat to freedom no matter who is leading and that liberty is freedom from domination.\n\nIn 1795, Condorcet had a book published called \"Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind\". It dealt with theoretical thought on perfecting the human mind and analyzing intellectual history based on social arithmetic. Thomas Malthus wrote \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\" (1798) partly in response to Condorcet's views on the \"\"perfectibility of society\".\"\n\nCondorcet took a leading role when the French Revolution swept France in 1789, hoping for a rationalist reconstruction of society, and championed many liberal causes. As a result, in 1791 he was elected as a Paris representative in the Legislative Assembly, and then became the secretary of the Assembly.\n\nIn April 1792 Condorcet presented a project for the reformation of the education system, aiming to create a hierarchical system, under the authority of experts, who would work as the guardians of the Enlightenment and who, independent of power, would be the guarantors of public liberties. The project was judged to be contrary to the republican and egalitarian virtues, giving the education of the Nation over to an aristocracy of savants. The institution adopted Condorcet's design for the state education system, and he drafted a proposed Bourbon Constitution for the new France.\n\nHe advocated women's suffrage for the new government, writing an article for \"Journal de la Société de 1789\", and by publishing \"De l'admission des femmes au droit de cité\" (\"For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women\") in 1790.\n\nCondorcet was not affiliated with any political party but counted many friends among the Girondins. He distanced himself from them during the National Convention, however, due to his distaste for their factionalism.\n\nAt the Trial of Louis XVI, Condorcet, who opposed the death penalty albeit supporting the trial itself, spoke out against the execution of the King during the public vote at the Convention – he proposed to send the king to the galleys.\n\nCondorcet was on the Constitution Committee and was the main author of the Girondin constitutional project. The constitution was not put to vote. When the Montagnards gained control of the Convention, they wrote their own, the French Constitution of 1793. Condorcet criticized the new work, and as a result, he was branded a traitor. On 3 October 1793, a warrant was issued for Condorcet's arrest.\n\nThe warrant forced Condorcet into hiding. He hid for five (or eight) months in the house of Mme. Vernet, on Rue Servandoni, in Paris. It was there that he wrote \"Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain\" (\"Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit\"), which was published posthumously in 1795 and is considered one of the major texts of the Enlightenment and of historical thought. It narrates the history of civilization as one of progress in the sciences, shows the intimate connection between scientific progress and the development of human rights and justice, and outlines the features of a future rational society entirely shaped by scientific knowledge.\n\nOn 25 March 1794 Condorcet, convinced he was no longer safe, left his hideout and attempted to flee Paris. He went to seek refuge at the house of Jean-Baptiste Suard, a friend of his with whom he had resided in 1772, but he was refused on the basis that he would be betrayed by one of their residents. Two days later, he was arrested in Clamart and imprisoned in Bourg-la-Reine (or, as it was known during the Revolution, \"Bourg-l'Égalité\", \"Equality Borough\" rather than \"Queen's Borough\") where, after another two days, he was found dead in his cell. The most widely accepted theory is that his friend, Pierre Jean George Cabanis, gave him a poison which he eventually used. However, some historians believe that he may have been murdered (perhaps because he was too loved and respected to be executed). Jean-Pierre Brancourt (in his work \"L'élite, la mort et la révolution\") claims that Condorcet was killed with a mixture of \"Datura stramonium\" and opium.\n\nCondorcet was symbolically interred in the Panthéon in 1989, in honour of the bicentennial of the French Revolution and Condorcet's role as a central figure in the Enlightenment. His coffin, however, was empty as his remains, originally interred in the common cemetery of Bourg-la-Reine, were lost during the nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1786 Condorcet married Sophie de Grouchy, who was more than twenty years his junior. Sophie, reckoned one of the most beautiful women of the day, became an accomplished salon hostess as Madame de Condorcet, and also an accomplished translator of Thomas Paine and Adam Smith. She was intelligent and well educated, fluent in both English and Italian. The marriage was a strong one, and Sophie visited her husband regularly while he remained in hiding. Although she began proceedings for divorce in January 1794, it was at the insistence of Condorcet and Cabanis, who wished to protect their property from expropriation and to provide financially for Sophie and their young daughter, Louise 'Eliza' Alexandrine.\n\nCondorcet was survived by his widow and four-year-old Eliza. Sophie died in 1822, never having remarried, and having published all her husband's works between 1801 and 1804. Her work was carried on by Eliza, wife of former United Irishman Arthur O'Connor. The Condorcet-O'Connors published a revised edition between 1847 and 1849.\n\nCondorcet's work was mainly focused on a quest for a more egalitarian society. This path led him to think and write about gender equality in the Revolutionary context. In 1790, he published \"De l'admission des femmes au droit de cité\"(\"On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship\") in which he strongly advocated for women's suffrage in the new Republic as well as the enlargement of basic political and social rights to include women. One of the most famous Enlightenment thinkers at the time, he was one of the first to make such a radical proposal. A visionary, he identified gender as a social construction based on perceived differences in sex and rejected biological determinism as being able to explain gender relations in society. He denounced patriarchal norms of oppression, present at every institutional level, and continuously subjugating and marginalising women. Like fellow Enlightenment thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his book \"Emile ou De l'Education\" (1762), Condorcet identified education as crucial to the emancipation of individuals. He stated: \"I believe that all other differences between men and women are simply the result of education″. He saw it as the only solution for women to deconstruct gender roles and promote another kind of masculinity, not based on violence, virility and the subjugation of women but rather on shared attributes such as reason and intelligence. In her book \"Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism\", Hooks calls this new concept \"feminine masculinity\", ″new models of self‐assertion that do not require the construction of an enemy 'other,' be it a woman or the symbolic feminine, for them to define themselves against″.\n\nCondorcet's whole plea for gender equality is founded on the recognition that the attribution of rights and authority comes from the false assumption that men possess reason and women do not. This is, according to Nall, an obvious example of an individual practising and advocating this feminist masculinity. As such, women should enjoy the same fundamental \"natural right\".\n\nScholars often disagree on the true impact that Condorcet's work had on pre-modern feminist thinking. His detractors point out that when he was eventually given some responsibilities in the constitutional drafting process, his convictions did not translate into concrete political action and made limited efforts to push these issues on the agenda. Some scholars on the other hand, believe that this lack of action is not due to the weakness of his commitment but rather to the political atmosphere at the time and the absence of political appetite for gender equality on the part of decision-makers. Along with authors such as Mary Wollstonecraft, d'Alembert or Olympe de Gouges, Condorcet made a lasting contribution to the pre-feminist debate.\n\nCondorcet's \"Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit\" (1795) was perhaps the most influential formulation of the idea of progress ever written. It made the Idea of Progress a central concern of Enlightenment thought. He argued that expanding knowledge in the natural and social sciences would lead to an ever more just world of individual freedom, material affluence, and moral compassion. He argued for three general propositions: that the past revealed an order that could be understood in terms of the progressive development of human capabilities, showing that humanity's \"present state, and those through which it has passed, are a necessary constitution of the moral composition of humankind\"; that the progress of the natural sciences must be followed by progress in the moral and political sciences \"no less certain, no less secure from political revolutions\"; that social evils are the result of ignorance and error rather than an inevitable consequence of human nature.\n\nCondorcet's writings were a key contribution to the French Enlightenment, particularly his work on the Idea of Progress. Condorcet believed that through the use of our senses and communication with others, knowledge could be compared and contrasted as a way of analyzing our systems of belief and understanding. None of Condorcet's writings refer to a belief in a religion or a god who intervenes in human affairs. Condorcet instead frequently had written of his faith in humanity itself and its ability to progress with the help of philosophers such as Aristotle. Through this accumulation and sharing of knowledge he believed it was possible for any man to comprehend all the known facts of the natural world. The enlightenment of the natural world spurred the desire for enlightenment of the social and political world. Condorcet believed that there was no definition of the perfect human existence and thus believed that the progression of the human race would inevitably continue throughout the course of our existence. He envisioned man as continually progressing toward a perfectly utopian society. He believed in the great potential towards growth that man possessed.\n\nHowever, Condorcet stressed that for this to be a possibility man must unify regardless of race, religion, culture or gender. To this end, he became a member of the French Société des Amis des Noirs (Society of the Friends of the Blacks). He wrote a set of rules for the Society of the Friends of the Blacks which detailed the reasoning and goals behind the organization along with describing the injustice of slavery and put in a statement calling for the abolition of the slave trade as the first step to true abolition.\n\nCondorcet was also a strong proponent of women's civil rights. He claimed that women were equal to men in nearly every aspect and asked why then should they be debarred from their fundamental civil rights; the few differences that existed were due to the fact that women were limited by their lack of rights. Condorcet even mentioned several women who were more capable then average men, such as Queen Elizabeth and Maria-Theresa.\n\nFor Condorcet's republicanism the nation needed enlightened citizens and education needed democracy to become truly public. Democracy implied free citizens, and ignorance was the source of servitude. Citizens had to be provided with the necessary knowledge to exercise their freedom and understand the rights and laws that guaranteed their enjoyment. Although education could not eliminate disparities in talent, all citizens, including women, had the right to free education. In opposition to those who relied on revolutionary enthusiasm to form the new citizens, Condorcet maintained that revolution was not made to last and that revolutionary institutions were not intended to prolong the revolutionary experience but to establish political rules and legal mechanisms that would insure future changes without revolution. In a democratic city there would be no Bastille to be seized. Public education would form free and responsible citizens, not revolutionaries.\n\nRothschild (2001) argues that Condorcet has been seen since the 1790s as the embodiment of the cold, rational Enlightenment. However she suggests his writings on economic policy, voting, and public instruction indicate different views both of Condorcet and of the Enlightenment. Condorcet was concerned with individual diversity; he was opposed to proto-utilitarian theories; he considered individual independence, which he described as the characteristic liberty of the moderns, to be of central political importance; and he opposed the imposition of universal and eternal principles. His efforts to reconcile the universality of some values with the diversity of individual opinions are of continuing interest. He emphasizes the institutions of civilized or constitutional conflict, recognizes conflicts or inconsistencies within individuals, and sees moral sentiments as the foundation of universal values. His difficulties call into question some familiar distinctions, for example between French, German, and English-Scottish thought, and between the Enlightenment and the counter-Enlightenment. There was substantial continuity between Condorcet's criticism of the economic ideas of the 1760s and the liberal thought of the early 19th century.\n\nThe Lycée Condorcet in the rue du Havre, in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, is named in his honour, as are streets in many French cities.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It allows a qualitative understanding of the corresponding phenomena like time dilation and length contraction without mathematical equations.\n\nMinkowski diagrams are two-dimensional graphs that depict events as happening in a universe consisting of one space dimension and one time dimension. Unlike a regular distance-time graph, the distance will be displayed on the horizontal axis and time on the vertical axis. Additionally, the time and space units of measurement are chosen in such a way that an object moving at the speed of light is depicted as following a 45° angle to the diagram's axes.\n\nIn this way, each object, like an observer or a vehicle, traces a certain line in the diagram, which is called its world line. Also, each point in the diagram represents a certain position in space and time, and is called an event, regardless of whether anything relevant happens there.\n\nIn the study of 1-dimensional kinematics, position vs. time graphs (also called distance vs. time graphs, or p-t graphs) provide a useful means to describe motion. The specific features of the motion of objects are demonstrated by the shape and the slope of the lines. In the accompanying figure, the plotted object moves away from the origin at a uniform speed of 1.66 m/s for six seconds, halts for five seconds, then returns to the origin over a period of seven seconds at a non-constant speed.\n\nAt its most basic level, a spacetime diagram is merely a time vs position graph, with the directions of the axes in a usual p-t graph exchanged, that is, the vertical axis refers to temporal and the horizontal axis to spatial coordinate values. Especially when used in STR, the temporal axes of a spacetime diagram are scaled with the speed of light , and thus are often labeled by This changes the dimension of the addressed physical quantity from <\"Time\"> to <\"Length\">, in accordance to the dimension associated to the spatial axes, which are frequently labeled \n\nTo ease insight in how spacetime coordinates, measured by observers in different reference frames, compare with each other, it is useful to work with a simplified setup. With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. Setting the temporal component aside for the moment, two Galilean reference frames (i.e. conventional 3-space frames), S and S' (pronounced \"S prime\"), each with observers O and O' at rest in their respective frames, but measuring the other as moving with speeds ±\"v\" are said to be in \"standard configuration\", when:\n\nThis spatial setting is displayed in the accompanying figure, in which the temporal coordinates are separately annotated as quantities \"t\" and \"t\"'.\n\nIn a further step of simplification it is often possible to consider just the direction of the observed motion and ignore the other two spatial components, allowing \"x\" and \"ct\" to be plotted in 2-dimensional spacetime diagrams, as introduced above.\n\nThe term Minkowski diagram refers to a specific form of spacetime diagram frequently used in special relativity. The term is used in both a generic and particular sense. In general, a Minkowski diagram is a two-dimensional graphical depiction of a portion of Minkowski space, usually where space has been curtailed to a single dimension. The units of measurement in these diagrams are taken such that the light cone at an event consists of the lines of slope plus or minus one through that event. The horizontal lines correspond to the usual notion of \"simultaneous events\" for a stationary observer at the origin.\n\nA particular Minkowski diagram illustrates the result of a Lorentz transformation. The Lorentz transformation relates two inertial frames of reference, where an observer stationary at the event makes a change of velocity along the -axis. The new time axis of the observer forms an angle with the previous time axis, with (see the first figure on the right). In the new frame of reference the simultaneous events lie parallel to a line inclined by to the previous lines of simultaneity. This is the new -axis. Both the original set of axes and the primed set of axes have the property that they are orthogonal with respect to the Minkowski inner product or \"relativistic dot product\".\n\nWhatever the magnitude of , the line forms the universal bisector.\n\nThe space and time units of measurement on the axes may, for example, be taken as one of the following pairs:\n\nThis way, light paths are represented by lines parallel to the bisector between the axes.\n\nThe black axes labelled and on the adjoining diagram are the coordinate system of an observer, referred to as 'at rest', and who is positioned at . This observer's world line is identical with the time axis. Each parallel line to this axis would correspond also to an object at rest but at another position. The blue line describes an object moving with constant speed to the right, such as a moving observer.\n\nThis blue line labelled may be interpreted as the time axis for the second observer. Together with the axis, which is identical for both observers, it represents their coordinate system. Since the reference frames are in standard configuration, both observers agree on the location of the origin of their coordinate systems. The axes for the moving observer are not perpendicular to each other and the scale on their time axis is stretched. To determine the coordinates of a certain event, two lines, each parallel to one of the two axes, must be constructed passing through the event, and their intersections with the axes read off.\n\nDetermining position and time of the event A as an example in the diagram leads to the same time for both observers, as expected. Only for the position different values result, because the moving observer has approached the position of the event A since . Generally stated, all events on a line parallel to the axis happen simultaneously for both observers. There is only one universal time , modelling the existence of one common position axis. On the other hand, due to two different time axes the observers usually measure different coordinates for the same event. This graphical translation from and to and and vice versa is described mathematically by the so-called Galilean transformation.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1905) discovered that the Newtonian description is wrong, with Hermann Minkowski in 1908 providing the graphical representation. Space and time have properties which lead to different rules for the translation of coordinates in case of moving observers. In particular, events which are estimated to happen simultaneously from the viewpoint of one observer, happen at different times for the other.\n\nIn the Minkowski diagram this relativity of simultaneity corresponds with the introduction of a separate formula_1 for the moving observer. Following the rule described above, each observer interprets all events on a line parallel to his formula_2 or formula_1 axis as simultaneous. The sequence of events from the viewpoint of an observer can be illustrated graphically by shifting this line in the diagram from bottom to top.\n\nIf instead of is assigned on the time axes, the angle between the and axes will be identical with that between the time axes and . This follows from the second postulate of special relativity, which says that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion (see below). The angle is given by\n\nThe corresponding translation from and to and and vice versa is described mathematically by the Lorentz transformation. Whatever space and time axes arise through such transformation, in a Minkowski diagram they correspond to conjugate diameters of a pair of hyperbolas. The scales on the axes are given as follows: If is the unit length on the axes of and respectively, the unit length on the axes of and is:\n\nThe -axis represents the worldline of a clock resting in , with representing the duration between two events happening on this worldline, also called the proper time between these events. Length upon the -axis represents the rest length or proper length of a rod resting in . The same interpretation can also be applied to distance upon the - and -axes for clocks and rods resting in .\n\nIn Minkowski’s 1908 paper there were three diagrams, first to illustrate the Lorentz transformation, then the partition of the plane by the light-cone, and finally illustration of worldlines. The first diagram used a branch of the unit hyperbola formula_6 to show the locus of a unit of proper time depending on velocity, thus illustrating time dilation. The second diagram showed the conjugate hyperbola to calibrate space, where a similar stretching leaves the impression of FitzGerald contraction. In 1914 Ludwik Silberstein included a diagram of \"Minkowski’s representation of the Lorentz transformation\". This diagram included the unit hyperbola, its conjugate, and a pair of conjugate diameters. Since the 1960s a version of this more complete configuration has been referred to as The Minkowski Diagram, and used as a standard illustration of the transformation geometry of special relativity. E. T. Whittaker has pointed out that the principle of relativity is tantamount to the arbitrariness of what hyperbola radius is selected for time in the Minkowski diagram. In 1912 Gilbert N. Lewis and Edwin B. Wilson applied the methods of synthetic geometry to develop the properties of the non-Euclidean plane that has Minkowski diagrams.\n\nWhile the rest frame has space and time axes at right angles, the moving frame has primed axes which form an acute angle. Since the frames are meant to be equivalent, the asymmetry may be disturbing. However, several authors showed that there is a frame of reference between the resting and moving ones where their symmetry would be apparent (\"median frame\"). In this frame, the two other frames are moving in opposite directions with equal speed. Using such coordinates makes the units of length and time the same for both axes. If and is given between S and S′, then these expressions are connected with the values in their median frame S as follows:\n\nFor instance, if between S and S′, then by (2) they are moving in their median frame S with approximately each in opposite directions. On the other hand, if in S, then by (1) the relative velocity between S and S′ in their own rest frames is . The construction of the axes of S and S′ is done in accordance with the ordinary method using with respect to the orthogonal axes of the median frame (Fig. 1).\n\nHowever, it turns out that, when drawing such a symmetric diagram, it is possible to derive the diagram's relations even without mentioning the median frame and at all. Instead, the relative velocity between S and S′ can directly be used in the following construction, providing the same result: If is the angle between the axes of and (or between and ), and between the axes of and , it is given:\n\nTwo methods of construction are obvious from Fig. 2: (a) The -axis is drawn perpendicular to the -axis, the and -axes are added at angle ; (b) the \"x\"′-axis is drawn at angle with respect to the -axis, the -axis is added perpendicular to the -axis and the -axis perpendicular to the -axis.\n\nAlso the components of a vector can be vividly demonstrated by such diagrams (Fig. 3): The parallel projections of vector are its contravariant components, its covariant components.\n\n\nRelativistic time dilation means that a clock (indicating its proper time) that moves relative to an observer is observed to run slower. In fact, time itself in the frame of the moving clock is observed to run slower. This can be read immediately from the adjoining Loedel diagram quite straightforwardly because unit lengths in the two system of axes are identical. Thus, in order to compare reading between the two systems, we can simply compare lengths as they appear on the page: we do not need to consider the fact that unit lengths on each axis are warped by the factor\nwhich we would have to account for in the corresponding Minkowski diagram.\n\nThe observer whose reference frame is given by the black axes is assumed to move from the origin O towards A. The moving clock has the reference frame given by the blue axes and moves from O to B. For the black observer, all events happening simultaneously with the event at A are located on a straight line parallel to its space axis. This line passes through A and B, so A and B are simultaneous from the reference frame of the observer with black axes. However, the clock that is moving relative to the black observer marks off time along the blue time axis. This is represented by the distance from O to B. Therefore, the observer at A with the black axes notices their clock as reading the distance from O to A while they observe the clock moving relative him or her to read the distance from O to B. Due to the distance from O to B being smaller than the distance from O to A, they conclude that the time passed on the clock moving relative to them is smaller than that passed on their own clock.\n\nA second observer, having moved together with the clock from O to B, will argue that the other clock has reached only C until this moment and therefore this clock runs slower. The reason for these apparently paradoxical statements is the different determination of the events happening synchronously at different locations. Due to the principle of relativity, the question of who is right has no answer and does not make sense.\n\nRelativistic length contraction means that the proper length of an object moving relative to an observer is decreased and finally also the space itself is contracted in this system. The observer is assumed again to move along the -axis. The world lines of the endpoints of an object moving relative to him are assumed to move along the -axis and the parallel line passing through A and B. For this observer the endpoints of the object at are O and A. For a second observer moving together with the object, so that for him the object is at rest, it has the proper length OB at . Due to . the object is contracted for the first observer.\n\nThe second observer will argue that the first observer has evaluated the endpoints of the object at O and A respectively and therefore at different times, leading to a wrong result due to his motion in the meantime. If the second observer investigates the length of another object with endpoints moving along the -axis and a parallel line passing through C and D he concludes the same way this object to be contracted from OD to OC. Each observer estimates objects moving with the other observer to be contracted. This apparently paradoxical situation is again a consequence of the relativity of simultaneity as demonstrated by the analysis via Minkowski diagram.\n\nFor all these considerations it was assumed, that both observers take into account the speed of light and their distance to all events they see in order to determine the actual times at which these events happen from their point of view.\n Another postulate of special relativity is the constancy of the speed of light. It says that any observer in an inertial reference frame measuring the vacuum speed of light relative to himself obtains the same value regardless of his own motion and that of the light source. This statement seems to be paradoxical, but it follows immediately from the differential equation yielding this, and the Minkowski diagram agrees. It explains also the result of the Michelson–Morley experiment which was considered to be a mystery before the theory of relativity was discovered, when photons were thought to be waves through an undetectable medium.\n\nFor world lines of photons passing the origin in different directions and holds. That means any position on such a world line corresponds with steps on - and -axes of equal absolute value. From the rule for reading off coordinates in coordinate system with tilted axes follows that the two world lines are the angle bisectors of the - and -axes. The Minkowski diagram shows, that they are angle bisectors of the - and -axes as well. That means both observers measure the same speed for both photons.\n\nFurther coordinate systems corresponding to observers with arbitrary velocities can be added to this Minkowski diagram. For all these systems both photon world lines represent the angle bisectors of the axes. The more the relative speed approaches the speed of light the more the axes approach the corresponding angle bisector. The formula_2 axis is always more flat and the time axis more steep than the photon world lines. The scales on both axes are always identical, but usually different from those of the other coordinate systems.\n\nStraight lines passing the origin which are steeper than both photon world lines correspond with objects moving more slowly than the speed of light. If this applies to an object, then it applies from the viewpoint of all observers, because the world lines of these photons are the angle bisectors for any inertial reference frame. Therefore, any point above the origin and between the world lines of both photons can be reached with a speed smaller than that of the light and can have a cause-and-effect relationship with the origin. This area is the absolute future, because any event there happens later compared to the event represented by the origin regardless of the observer, which is obvious graphically from the Minkowski diagram.\n\nFollowing the same argument the range below the origin and between the photon world lines is the absolute past relative to the origin. Any event there belongs definitely to the past and can be the cause of an effect at the origin.\n\nThe relationship between any such pairs of event is called \"timelike\", because they have a time distance greater than zero for all observers. A straight line connecting these two events is always the time axis of a possible observer for whom they happen at the same place. Two events which can be connected just with the speed of light are called \"lightlike\".\n\nIn principle a further dimension of space can be added to the Minkowski diagram leading to a three-dimensional representation. In this case the ranges of future and past become cones with apexes touching each other at the origin. They are called light cones.\n\nFollowing the same argument, all straight lines passing through the origin and which are more nearly horizontal than the photon world lines, would correspond to objects or signals moving faster than light regardless of the speed of the observer. Therefore, no event outside the light cones can be reached from the origin, even by a light-signal, nor by any object or signal moving with less than the speed of light. Such pairs of events are called \"spacelike\" because they have a finite spatial distance different from zero for all observers. On the other hand, a straight line connecting such events is always the space coordinate axis of a possible observer for whom they happen at the same time. By a slight variation of the velocity of this coordinate system in both directions it is always possible to find two inertial reference frames whose observers estimate the chronological order of these events to be different.\n\nTherefore, an object moving faster than light, say from O to A in the adjoining diagram, would imply that, for any observer watching the object moving from O to A, another observer can be found (moving at less than the speed of light with respect to the first) for whom the object moves from A to O. The question of which observer is right has no unique answer, and therefore makes no physical sense. Any such moving object or signal would violate the principle of causality.\n\nAlso, any general technical means of sending signals faster than light would permit information to be sent into the originator's own past. In the diagram, an observer at O in the system sends a message moving faster than light to A. At A, it is received by another observer, moving so as to be in the system, who sends it back, again faster than light, arriving at B. But B is in the past relative to O. The absurdity of this process becomes obvious when both observers subsequently confirm that they received no message at all, but all messages were directed towards the other observer as can be seen graphically in the Minkowski diagram. Furthermore, if it were possible to accelerate an observer to the speed of light, their space and time axes would coincide with their angle bisector. The coordinate system would collapse, in concordance with the fact that due to time dilation, time would effectively stop passing for them.\n\nThese considerations show that the speed of light as a limit is a consequence of the properties of spacetime, and not of the properties of objects such as technologically imperfect space ships. The prohibition of faster-than-light motion, therefore, has nothing in particular to do with electromagnetic waves or light, but comes as a consequence of the structure of spacetime.\nWhen Taylor and Wheeler composed \"Spacetime Physics\" (1966), they did \"not\" use the term \"Minkowski diagram\" for their spacetime geometry. Instead they included an acknowledgement of Minkowski’s contribution to philosophy by the totality of his innovation of 1908.\n\nWhen abstracted to a line drawing, then any figure showing conjugate hyperbolas, with a selection of conjugate diameters, falls into this category. Students making drawings to accompany the exercises in George Salmon’s \"A Treatise on Conic Sections\" (1900) at pages 165–171 (on conjugate diameters) will be making Minkowski diagrams.\n\nThe momentarily co-moving inertial frames along the world line of a rapidly accelerating observer (center). The vertical direction indicates time, while the horizontal indicates distance, the dashed line is the spacetime trajectory (\"world line\") of the observer. The small dots are specific events in spacetime. If one imagines these events to be the flashing of a light, then the events that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past light cone of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer. The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how the momentarily co-moving inertial frame changes when the observer accelerates.\n\n\n"}

(The rest of this article, however, will only consider multilinear forms on finite-dimensional vector spaces.)\n\nA multilinear \"k\"-form on formula_1 over formula_7 is called a (covariant) \"k\"-tensor, and the vector space of such forms is usually denoted formula_8 or formula_9.\n\nGiven \"k\"-tensor formula_10 and \"ℓ\"-tensor formula_11, a product formula_12, known as the tensor product, can be defined by the propertyformula_13,for all formula_14. The tensor product of multilinear forms is not commutative; however it is bilinear and associative: formula_15, formula_16, andformula_17.If formula_18 forms a basis for \"n\"-dimensional vector space formula_1 and formula_20 is the corresponding dual basis for the dual space formula_21, then the products formula_22, with formula_23 form a basis for formula_8. Consequently, formula_8 has dimensionality formula_26.\n\n\"Main article: Bilinear forms\"\n\nIf formula_27, formula_28 is referred to as a bilinear form. A familiar and important example of a (symmetric) bilinear form is the standard inner product (dot product) of vectors.\n\n\"Main article: Alternating multilinear maps\"\n\nAn important class of multilinear forms are the alternating multilinear forms, which have the additional property thatformula_29,where formula_30 is a permutation and formula_31 denotes its sign (+1 if even, –1 if odd). As a consequence, alternating multilinear forms are antisymmetric with respect to swapping of any two arguments (i.e., formula_32 and formula_33):formula_34.With the additional hypothesis that the characteristic of the field formula_4 is not 2, setting formula_36 implies as a corollary that formula_37; that is, the form has a value of 0 whenever two of its arguments are equal. Note, however, that some authors use this last condition as the defining property of alternating forms. This definition implies the property given at the beginning of the section, but as noted above, the converse implication holds only when formula_38.\n\nAn alternating multilinear \"k\"-form on formula_1 over formula_7 is called a multicovector of degree \"k or k\"-covector, and the vector space of such alternating forms, a subspace of formula_8, is generally denoted formula_42, or, using the notation for the isomorphic \"k\"th exterior power of formula_43(the dual space of formula_1), formula_45. Note that linear functionals (multilinear 1-forms over formula_7) are trivially alternating, so that formula_47, while, by convention, 0-forms are defined to be scalars: formula_48.\n\nThe determinant on formula_49 matrices, viewed as an formula_50 argument function of the column vectors, is an important example of an alternating multilinear form.\n\nThe tensor product of alternating multilinear forms is, in general, no longer alternating. However, by summing over all permutations of the tensor product, taking into account the parity of each term, the wedge product (formula_51) of multicovectors can be defined, so that if formula_52 and formula_53, then formula_54:formula_55,where the sum is taken over the set of all permutations over formula_56 elements, formula_57. The wedge product is bilinear, associative, and anticommutative: if formula_52 and formula_53 then formula_60. \n\nGiven a basis formula_18 for formula_1 and dual basis formula_20 for formula_64, the wedge products formula_65, with formula_66 form a basis for formula_42. Hence, the dimensionality of formula_42 for \"n\"-dimensional formula_1 is formula_70.\n\n\"Main article: Differential forms\"\n\nDifferential forms are mathematical objects constructed via tangent spaces and multilinear forms that behave, in many ways, like differentials in the classical sense. Though conceptually and computationally useful, differentials are founded on ill-defined notions of infinitesimal quantities developed early in the history of calculus. Differential forms provide a mathematically rigorous and precise framework to modernize this long-standing idea. Differential forms are especially useful in multivariable calculus (analysis) and differential geometry because they possess transformation properties that allow them be integrated on curves, surfaces, and their higher-dimensional analogues (differentiable manifolds). One far-reaching application is the modern statement of Stokes' theorem, a sweeping generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus to higher dimensions. \n\nThe synopsis below is primarily based on Spivak (1965) and Tu (2011).\n\nTo define differential forms on open subsets formula_71, we first need the notion of the tangent space of formula_72at formula_73, usually denoted formula_74 or formula_75. The vector space formula_75 can be defined most conveniently as the set of elements formula_77 (formula_78, with formula_79 fixed) with vector addition and scalar multiplication defined by formula_80 and formula_81, respectively. Moreover, if formula_82 is the standard basis for formula_72, then formula_84 is the analogous standard basis for formula_75. In other words, each tangent space formula_75 can simply be regarded as a copy of formula_72 (a set of tangent vectors) based at the point formula_73. The collection (disjoint union) of tangent spaces of formula_72 at all formula_79 is known as the tangent bundle of formula_72 and is usually denoted formula_92. While the definition given here provides a simple description of the tangent space of formula_72, there are other, more sophisticated constructions that are better suited for defining the tangent spaces of smooth manifolds in general (\"see the article on tangent spaces for details\"). \n\nA differential \"k\"-form on formula_71 is defined as a function formula_95 that assigns to every formula_96 a \"k\"-covector on the tangent space of formula_72at formula_73, usually denoted formula_99. In brief, a differential \"k-\"form is a \"k\"-covector field. The space of \"k\"-forms on formula_100 is usually denoted formula_101; thus if formula_95 is a differential \"k\"-form, we write formula_103. By convention, a continuous function on formula_100 is a differential 0-form: formula_105.\n\nWe first construct differential 1-forms from 0-forms and deduce some of their basic properties. To simplify the discussion below, we will only consider smooth differential forms constructed from smooth (formula_106) functions. Let formula_107 be a smooth function. We define the 1-form formula_108 on formula_100 for formula_96 and formula_111 by formula_112, where formula_113 is the total derivative of formula_114 at formula_73. (Recall that the total derivative is a linear transformation.) Of particular interest are the projection maps (also known as coordinate functions) formula_116, defined by formula_117, where formula_118 is the \"i\"th standard coordinate of formula_119. The 1-forms formula_120 are known as the basic 1-forms; they are conventionally denoted formula_121. If the standard coordinates of formula_111 are formula_123, then application of the definition of formula_108 yields formula_125, so that formula_126, where formula_127 is the Kronecker delta. Thus, as the dual of the standard basis for formula_75, formula_129 forms a basis for formula_130. As a consequence, if formula_95 is a 1-form on formula_100, then formula_95 can be written as formula_134 for smooth functions formula_135. Furthermore, we can derive an expression for formula_108 that coincides with the classical expression for a total differential:formula_137.\n\n[\"Comments on\" \"notation:\" In this article, we follow the convention from tensor calculus and differential geometry in which multivectors and multicovectors are written with lower and upper indices, respectively. Since differential forms are multicovector fields, upper indices are employed to index them. The opposite rule applies to the \"components\" of multivectors and multicovectors, which instead are written with upper and lower indices, respectively. For instance, we represent the standard coordinates of vector formula_78 as formula_139, so that formula_140 in terms of the standard basis formula_82. In addition, superscripts appearing in the \"denominator\" of an expression (as in formula_142) are treated as lower indices in this convention. When indices are applied and interpreted in this manner, the number of upper indices minus the number of lower indices in each term of an expression is conserved, both within the sum and across an equal sign, a feature that serves as a useful mnemonic device and helps pinpoint errors made during manual computation.]\n\nThe wedge product (formula_51) and exterior differentiation (formula_144) are two fundamental operations on differential forms. The wedge product of a \"k\"-form and an \"ℓ\"-form is a formula_145-form, while the exterior derivative of a \"k\"-form is a formula_146-form. Thus, both operations generate differential forms of higher degree from those of lower degree.\n\nThe wedge product formula_147 of differential forms is a special case of the wedge product of multicovectors in general (\"see above\"). As is true in general for the wedge product, the wedge product of differential forms is bilinear, associative, and anticommutative.\n\nMore concretely, if formula_148 and formula_149, then formula_150. Furthermore, for any set of indices formula_151, formula_152. If formula_153, formula_154, and formula_155, then the indices of formula_156 can be arranged in ascending order by a (finite) sequence of such swaps. Since formula_157, formula_158 implies that formula_159. Finally, as a consequence of bilinearity, if formula_95 and formula_161 are the sums of several terms, their wedge product obeys distributivity with respect to each of these terms. \n\nThe collection of the wedge products of basic 1-forms formula_162 constitutes a basis for the space of differential \"k\"-forms. Thus, any formula_103 can be written in the formformula_164 (*),where formula_165 are smooth functions. With each set of indices formula_166 placed in ascending order, (*) is said to be the standard presentation of formula_95. <br>\n\nIn the previous section, the 1-form formula_108 was defined by taking the exterior derivative of the 0-form (continuous function) formula_114. We now extend this by defining the exterior derivative operator formula_170 for formula_171. If the standard presentation of \"k\"-form formula_95 is given by (*), the formula_146-form formula_174 is defined byformula_175.A property of formula_144 that holds for all smooth forms is that the second exterior derivative of any formula_95 vanishes identically: formula_178. This can be established directly from the definition of formula_144 and the equality of mixed second-order partial derivatives of formula_180 functions (\"see the article on closed and exact forms for details\"). \n\nTo integrate a differential form over a parameterized domain, we first need to introduce the notion of the pullback of a differential form. Roughly speaking, when a differential form is integrated, applying the pullback transforms it in a way that correctly accounts for a change-of-coordinates. \n\nGiven a differentiable function formula_181 and \"k\"-form formula_182, we call formula_183 the pullback of formula_161 by formula_114 and define it as the \"k\"-form such that formula_186, for formula_187, where formula_188 is the map formula_189.<br>\n\nIf formula_190 is an \"n\"-form on formula_72 (i.e., formula_192), we define its integral over the unit \"n\"-cell as the iterated Riemann integral of formula_114:formula_194.Next, we consider a domain of integration parameterized by a differentiable function formula_195, known as an n\"-cube. To define the integral of formula_196 over formula_197, we \"pull back\" from formula_198 to the unit \"n\"-cell:formula_199.To integrate over more general domains, we define an n-\"chain formula_200 as the formal sum of \"n-\"cubes and setformula_201.An appropriate definition of the formula_202-chain formula_203, known as the boundary of formula_204, allows us to state the celebrated Stokes' theorem (Stokes–Cartan theorem) for chains in a subset of formula_205: \"If formula_95 is a\" \"smooth\" formula_202\"-form on an open set formula_208\" \"and formula_204\" \"is a smooth\" formula_210\"-chain in formula_198, thenformula_212.\"Using more sophisticated machinery (e.g., germs and derivations), the tangent space formula_213 of any smooth manifold formula_214 (not necessarily embedded in formula_205) can be defined. Analogously, a differential form formula_216 on a general smooth manifold is a map formula_217. Stokes' theorem can be further generalized to arbitrary smooth manifolds-with-boundary and even certain \"rough\" domains (\"see the article on Stokes' theorem for details\").\n\n"}

His algorithm thus enables faster business and policy decisions. Karmarkar's algorithm has stimulated the development of several interior point methods, some of which are used in current codes for solving linear programs.\n\nThe Association for Computing Machinery awarded him the prestigious Paris Kanellakis Award in 2000 for his work on polynomial time interior point methods for linear programming.\n\nAfter working on the Interior Point Method, Karmarkar worked on a new architecture for supercomputing, based on concepts from finite geometry, especially projective geometry over finite fields.\n\nCurrently, he is synthesizing these concepts with some new ideas he calls \"sculpturing free space\" (a non-linear analogue of what has popularly been described as \"folding the perfect corner\"). This approach allows him to extend this work to the physical design of machines. He is now publishing updates on his recent work, including an extended abstract. This new paradigm was presented at IVNC, Poland on 16 July 2008, and at MIT on 25 July 2008. Some of his recent work is published at ieeexplore. He delivered a lecture on his on going work at IIT Bombay in September 2013. He gave a four-part series of lectures at FOCM 2014 (Foundations of Computational Mathematics) titled \"Towards a Broader View of Theory of Computing\".

Many of the simple molecules of organic chemistry, such as the alkanes and alkenes, have both linear and ring isomers, that is, both acyclic and cyclic, with the latter often classified as aromatic. For those with 4 or more carbons, the linear forms can have straight-chain or branched-chain isomers. The lowercase prefix \"n-\" denotes the straight-chain isomer; for example, \"n\"-butane is straight-chain butane, whereas \"i\"-butane is isobutane. Cycloalkanes are isomers of alkenes, not of alkanes, because the ring's closure involves a C=C bond. Having no rings (aromatic or otherwise), all open-chain compounds are aliphatic.\n\nTypically in biochemistry, some isomers are more prevalent than others. For example, in living organisms, the open-chain isomer of glucose usually exists only transiently, in small amounts; D-glucose is the usual isomer; and L-glucose is rare.\n\nStraight-chain molecules are often not literally straight, in the sense that their bond angles are often not 180°, but the name reflects that they are schematically straight. For example, the straight-chain alkanes are wavy or \"puckered\", as the models below show.\n"}
{"id": "37729421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37729421", "title": "Paving matroid", "text": "Paving matroid\n\nIn the mathematical theory of matroids, a paving matroid is a matroid in which every circuit has size at least as large as the matroid's rank. In a matroid of rank formula_1 every circuit has size at most formula_2, so it is equivalent to define paving matroids as the matroids in which the size of every circuit belongs to the set formula_3. It has been conjectured that almost all matroids are paving matroids.\n\nEvery simple matroid of rank three is a paving matroid; for instance this is true of the Fano matroid. The Vámos matroid provides another example, of rank four.\n\nUniform matroids of rank formula_1 have the property that every circuit is of length exactly formula_2 and hence are all paving matroids; the converse does not hold, for example, the cycle matroid of the complete graph formula_6 is paving but not uniform.\n\nA Steiner system formula_7 is a pair formula_8 where formula_9 is a finite set of size formula_10 and formula_11 is a family of formula_12-element subsets of formula_9 with the property that every formula_14-element subset of formula_9 is also a subset of exactly one set in formula_11. The elements of formula_11 form a formula_14-partition of formula_9 and hence are the hyperplanes of a paving matroid on formula_9.\n\nIf a paving matroid has rank formula_21, then its hyperplanes form a set system known as a formula_22-partition. A family of two or more sets formula_23 forms a formula_22-partition if every set in formula_23 has size at least formula_22 and every formula_22-element subset of formula_28 is a subset of exactly one set in formula_23. Conversely, if formula_23 is a formula_22-partition, then it can be used to define a paving matroid on formula_32 for which formula_23 is the set of hyperplanes. In this matroid, a subset formula_34 of formula_35 is independent whenever either formula_36 or formula_37 and formula_34 is not a subset of any set in formula_23.\n\nCombinatorial enumeration of the simple matroids on up to nine elements has shown that a large fraction of them are also paving matroids. On this basis, it has been conjectured that almost all matroids are paving matroids. More precisely, according to this conjecture, the limit, as \"n\" goes to infinity, of the ratio between the number of paving matroids and the number of all matroids should equal one. If so, the same statement can be made for the sparse paving matroids, matroids that are both paving and dual to a paving matroid. Although this remains open, a similar statement on the asymptotic ratio of the logarithms of the numbers of matroids and sparse paving matroids has been proven.\n\nPaving matroids were initially studied by , in their equivalent formulation in terms of formula_22-partitions; Hartmanis called them generalized partition lattices. In their 1970 book \"Combinatorial Geometries\", Henry Crapo and Gian-Carlo Rota observed that these structures were matroidal; the name \"paving matroid\" was introduced by following a suggestion of Rota.\n\nThe simpler structure of paving matroids, compared to arbitrary matroids, has allowed some facts about them to be proven that remain elusive in the more general case. An example is Rota's basis conjecture, the statement that a set of \"n\" disjoint bases in a rank-\"n\" matroid can be arranged into an \"n\" × \"n\" matrix so that the rows of the matrix are the given bases and the columns are also bases. It has been proven true for paving matroids, but remains open for most other matroids.\n\n"}

{"id": "24350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24350", "title": "Projective plane", "text": "Projective plane\n\nIn mathematics, a projective plane is a geometric structure that extends the concept of a plane. In the ordinary Euclidean plane, two lines typically intersect in a single point, but there are some pairs of lines (namely, parallel lines) that do not intersect. A projective plane can be thought of as an ordinary plane equipped with additional \"points at infinity\" where parallel lines intersect. Thus \"any\" two distinct lines in a projective plane intersect in one and only one point.\n\nA projective plane is a 2-dimensional projective space, but not all projective planes can be embedded in 3-dimensional projective spaces. Such embeddability is a consequence of a property known as Desargues' theorem, not shared by all projective planes.\n\nA projective plane consists of a set of lines, a set of points, and a relation between points and lines called incidence, having the following properties:\n\nThe second condition means that there are no parallel lines. The last condition excludes the so-called degenerate cases (see below). The term \"incidence\" is used to emphasize the symmetric nature of the relationship between points and lines. Thus the expression \"point \"P\" is incident with line \"ℓ\" \" is used instead of either \"\"P\" is on \"ℓ\" \" or \"\"ℓ\" passes through \"P\" \".\n\nTo turn the ordinary Euclidean plane into a projective plane proceed as follows:\n\nThe extended structure is a projective plane and is called the extended Euclidean plane or the real projective plane. The process outlined above, used to obtain it, is called \"projective completion\" or \"projectivization\". This plane can also be constructed by starting from R viewed as a vector space, see below.\n\nThe points of the Moulton plane are the points of the Euclidean plane, with coordinates in the usual way. To create the Moulton plane from the Euclidean plane some of the lines are redefined. That is, some of their point sets will be changed, but other lines will remain unchanged. Redefine all the lines with negative slopes so that they look like \"bent\" lines, meaning that these lines keep their points with negative \"x\"-coordinates, but the rest of their points are replaced with the points of the line with the same \"y\"-intercept but twice the slope wherever their \"x\"-coordinate is positive.\n\nThe Moulton plane has parallel classes of lines and is an affine plane. It can be projectivized, as in the previous example, to obtain the projective Moulton plane. Desargues' theorem is not a valid theorem in either the Moulton plane or the projective Moulton plane.\n\nThis example has just thirteen points and thirteen lines. We label the points P...,P and the lines m...,m. The incidence relation (which points are on which lines) can be given by the following incidence matrix. The rows are labelled by the points and the columns are labelled by the lines. A 1 in row \"i\" and column \"j\" means that the point P is on the line m, while a 0 (which we represent here by a blank cell for ease of reading) means that they are not incident. The matrix is in Paige-Wexler normal form.\n\nTo verify the conditions that make this a projective plane, observe that every two rows have exactly one common column in which 1's appear (every pair of distinct points are on exactly one common line) and that every two columns have exactly one common row in which 1's appear (every pair of distinct lines meet at exactly one point). Among many possibilities, the points P,P,P,and P, for example, will satisfy the third condition. This example is known as the projective plane of order three.\n\nThough the line at infinity of the extended real plane may appear to have a different nature than the other lines of that projective plane, this is not the case. Another construction of the same projective plane shows that no line can be distinguished (on geometrical grounds) from any other. In this construction, each \"point\" of the real projective plane is the one-dimensional subspace through the origin in a 3-dimensional vector space, and a \"line\" in the projective plane arises from a plane through the origin in the 3-space. This idea can be generalized and made more precise as follows.\n\nLet \"K\" be any division ring (skewfield). Let \"K\" denote the set of all triples \"x\" = (\"x\", \"x\", \"x\") of elements of \"K\" (a Cartesian product viewed as a vector space). For any nonzero \"x\" in \"K\", the minimal subspace of \"K\" containing \"x\" (which may be visualized as all the vectors in a line through the origin) is the subset\nof \"K\". Similarly, let \"x\" and \"y\" be linearly independent elements of \"K\", meaning that implies that . The minimal subspace of \"K\" containing \"x\" and \"y\" (which may be visualized as all the vectors in a plane through the origin) is the subset\nof \"K\". This 2-dimensional subspace contains various 1-dimensional subspaces through the origin that may be obtained by fixing \"k\" and \"m\" and taking the multiples of the resulting vector. Different choices of \"k\" and \"m\" that are in the same ratio will give the same line.\n\nThe projective plane over \"K\", denoted PG(2,\"K\") or \"K\"P, has a set of \"points\" consisting of all the 1-dimensional subspaces in \"K\". A subset \"L\" of the points of PG(2,\"K\") is a \"line\" in PG(2,\"K\") if there exists a 2-dimensional subspace of \"K\" whose set of 1-dimensional subspaces is exactly \"L\".\n\nVerifying that this construction produces a projective plane is usually left as a linear algebra exercise.\n\nAn alternate (algebraic) view of this construction is as follows. The points of this projective plane are the equivalence classes of the set modulo the equivalence relation\nLines in the projective plane are defined exactly as above.\n\nThe coordinates (\"x\", \"x\", \"x\") of a point in PG(2,\"K\") are called homogeneous coordinates. Each triple (\"x\", \"x\", \"x\") represents a well-defined point in PG(2,\"K\"), except for the triple (0, 0, 0), which represents no point. Each point in PG(2,\"K\"), however, is represented by many triples.\n\nIf \"K\" is a topological space, then \"K\"P, inherits a topology via the product, subspace, and quotient topologies.\n\nThe real projective plane RP, arises when \"K\" is taken to be the real numbers, R. As a closed, non-orientable real 2-manifold, it serves as a fundamental example in topology.\n\nIn this construction consider the unit sphere centered at the origin in R. Each of the R lines in this construction intersects the sphere at two antipodal points. Since the R line represents a point of RP, we will obtain the same model of RP by identifying the antipodal points of the sphere. The lines of RP will be the great circles of the sphere after this identification of antipodal points. This description gives the standard model of elliptic geometry.\n\nThe complex projective plane CP, arises when \"K\" is taken to be the complex numbers, C. It is a closed complex 2-manifold, and hence a closed, orientable real 4-manifold. It and projective planes over other fields (known as pappian planes) serve as fundamental examples in algebraic geometry.\n\nThe quaternionic projective plane HP is also of independent interest.\n\nBy Wedderburn's Theorem, a finite division ring must be commutative and so a field. Thus, the finite examples of this construction are known as \"field planes\". Taking \"K\" to be the finite field of \"q\" = \"p\" elements with prime \"p\" produces a projective plane of \"q\" + \"q\" + 1 points. The field planes are usually denoted by PG(2,\"q\") where PG stands for projective geometry, the \"2\" is the dimension and \"q\" is called the order of the plane (it is one less than the number of points on any line). The Fano plane, discussed below, is denoted by PG(2,2). The third example above is the projective plane PG(2,3).\n\nThe Fano plane is the projective plane arising from the field of two elements. It is the smallest projective plane, with only seven points and seven lines. In the figure at right, the seven points are shown as small black balls, and the seven lines are shown as six line segments and a circle. However, one could equivalently consider the balls to be the \"lines\" and the line segments and circle to be the \"points\" – this is an example of duality in the projective plane: if the lines and points are interchanged, the result is still a projective plane (see below). A permutation of the seven points that carries collinear points (points on the same line) to collinear points is called a \"collineation\" or \"symmetry\" of the plane. The collineations of a geometry form a group under composition, and for the Fano plane this group (PΓL(3,2) = PGL(3,2)) has 168 elements.\n\nThe theorem of Desargues is universally valid in a projective plane if and only if the plane can be constructed from a three-dimensional vector space over a skewfield as above. These planes are called Desarguesian planes, named after Girard Desargues. The real (or complex) projective plane and the projective plane of order 3 given above are examples of Desarguesian projective planes. The projective planes that can not be constructed in this manner are called non-Desarguesian planes, and the Moulton plane given above is an example of one. The PG(2,\"K\") notation is reserved for the Desarguesian planes. When \"K\" is a field, a very common case, they are also known as \"field planes\" and if the field is a finite field they can be called \"Galois planes\".\n\nA subplane of a projective plane is a subset of the points of the plane which themselves form a projective plane with the same incidence relations.\n\nWhen \"N\" is a square, subplanes of order are called \"Baer subplanes\". Every point of the plane lies on a line of a Baer subplane and every line of the plane contains a point of the Baer subplane.\n\nIn the finite Desarguesian planes PG(2,\"p\"), the subplanes have orders which are the orders of the subfields of the finite field GF(\"p\"), that is, \"p\" where \"i\" is a divisor of \"n\". In non-Desarguesian planes however, Bruck's theorem gives the only information about subplane orders. The case of equality in the inequality of this theorem is not known to occur. Whether or not there exists a subplane of order \"M\" in a plane of order \"N\" with \"M\" + \"M\" = \"N\" is an open question. If such subplanes existed there would be projective planes of composite (non-prime power) order.\n\nA Fano subplane is a subplane isomorphic to PG(2,2), the unique projective plane of order 2.\n\nIf you consider a \"quadrangle\" (a set of 4 points no three collinear) in this plane, the points determine six of the lines of the plane. The remaining three points (called the \"diagonal points\" of the quadrangle) are the points where the lines that do not intersect at a point of the quadrangle meet. The seventh line consists of all the diagonal points (usually drawn as a circle or semicircle).\n\nThe name \"Fano\" for this subplane is really a misnomer. Gino Fano (1871–1952), in developing a new set of axioms for Euclidean geometry, took as an axiom that the diagonal points of any quadrangle are never collinear. This is called \"Fano's Axiom\". A Fano subplane however violates Fano's Axiom. They really should be called \"Anti-Fano subplanes\", but this name change has not had many supporters.\n\nIn finite desarguesian planes, PG(2,\"q\"), Fano subplanes exist if and only if \"q\" is even (that is, a power of 2). The situation in non-desarguesian planes is unsettled. They could exist in any non-desarguesian plane of order greater than 6, and indeed, they have been found in all non-desarguesian planes in which they have been looked for (in both odd and even orders).\n\nAn open question is: Does every non-desarguesian plane contain a Fano subplane?\n\nA theorem concerning Fano subplanes due to is:\n\nProjectivization of the Euclidean plane produced the real projective plane. The inverse operation — starting with a projective plane, remove one line and all the points incident with that line — produces an affine plane.\n\nMore formally an affine plane consists of a set of lines and a set of points, and a relation between points and lines called incidence, having the following properties:\n\nThe second condition means that there are parallel lines and is known as Playfair's axiom. The expression \"does not meet\" in this condition is shorthand for \"there does not exist a point incident with both lines.\"\n\nThe Euclidean plane and the Moulton plane are examples of infinite affine planes. A finite projective plane will produce a finite affine plane when one of its lines and the points on it are removed. The order of a finite affine plane is the number of points on any of its lines (this will be the same number as the order of the projective plane from which it comes). The affine planes which arise from the projective planes PG(2,\"q\") are denoted by AG(2,\"q\").\n\nThere is a projective plane of order \"N\" if and only if there is an affine plane of order \"N\". When there is only one affine plane of order \"N\" there is only one projective plane of order \"N\", but the converse is not true. The affine planes formed by the removal of different lines of the projective plane will be isomorphic if and only if the removed lines are in the same orbit of the collineation group of the projective plane. These statements hold for infinite projective planes as well.\n\nThe affine plane \"K\" over \"K\" embeds into \"K\"P via the map which sends affine (non-homogeneous) coordinates to homogeneous coordinates,\n\nThe complement of the image is the set of points of the form (0, \"x\", \"x\"). From the point of view of the embedding just given, these points are the points at infinity. They constitute a line in \"K\"P — namely, the line arising from the plane\n\nin \"K\" — called the line at infinity. The points at infinity are the \"extra\" points where parallel lines intersect in the construction of the extended real plane; the point (0, \"x\", \"x\") is where all lines of slope \"x\" / \"x\" intersect. Consider for example the two lines\n\nin the affine plane \"K\". These lines have slope 0 and do not intersect. They can be regarded as subsets of \"KP via the embedding above, but these subsets are not lines in \"KP. Add the point (0, 1, 0) to each subset; that is, let\n\nThese are lines in \"K\"P; ū arises from the plane\n\nin \"K\", while ȳ arises from the plane\nThe projective lines ū and ȳ intersect at (0, 1, 0). In fact, all lines in \"K\" of slope 0, when projectivized in this manner, intersect at (0, 1, 0) in \"K\"P.\n\nThe embedding of \"K\" into \"K\"P given above is not unique. Each embedding produces its own notion of points at infinity. For example, the embedding\nhas as its complement those points of the form (\"x\", 0, \"x\"), which are then regarded as points at infinity.\n\nWhen an affine plane does not have the form of \"K\" with \"K\" a division ring, it can still be embedded in a projective plane, but the construction used above does not work. A commonly used method for carrying out the embedding in this case involves expanding the set of affine coordinates and working in a more general \"algebra\".\n\nOne can construct a coordinate \"ring\"—a so-called planar ternary ring (not a genuine ring)—corresponding to any projective plane. A planar ternary ring need not be a field or division ring, and there are many projective planes that are not constructed from a division ring. They are called non-Desarguesian projective planes and are an active area of research. The Cayley plane (OP), a projective plane over the octonions, is one of these because the octonions do not form a division ring.\n\nConversely, given a planar ternary ring (R,T), a projective plane can be constructed (see below). The relationship is not one to one. A projective plane may be associated with several non-isomorphic planar ternary rings. The ternary operator T can be used to produce two binary operators on the set R, by:\nThe ternary operator is linear if T(x,m,k) = x•m + k. When the set of coordinates of a projective plane actually form a ring, a linear ternary operator may be defined in this way, using the ring operations on the right, to produce a planar ternary ring.\n\nAlgebraic properties of this planar ternary coordinate ring turn out to correspond to geometric incidence properties of the plane. For example, Desargues' theorem corresponds to the coordinate ring being obtained from a division ring, while Pappus's theorem corresponds to this ring being obtained from a commutative field. A projective plane satisfying Pappus's theorem universally is called a \"Pappian plane\". Alternative, not necessarily associative, division algebras like the octonions correspond to Moufang planes.\n\nThere is no known purely geometric proof of the purely geometric statement that Desargues' theorem implies Pappus' theorem in a finite projective plane (finite Desarguesian planes are Pappian). (The converse is true in any projective plane and is provable geometrically, but finiteness is essential in this statement as there are infinite Desarguesian planes which are not Pappian.) The most common proof uses coordinates in a division ring and Wedderburn's theorem that finite division rings must be commutative; give a proof that uses only more \"elementary\" algebraic facts about division rings.\n\nTo describe a finite projective plane of order \"N\"(≥ 2) using non-homogeneous coordinates and a planar ternary ring:\nOn these points, construct the following lines:\n\nFor example, for \"N\"=2 we can use the symbols {0,1} associated with the finite field of order 2. The ternary operation defined by T(x,m,k) = xm + k with the operations on the right being the multiplication and addition in the field yields the following:\n\nDegenerate planes do not fulfill the third condition in the definition of a projective plane. They are not structurally complex enough to be interesting in their own right, but from time to time they arise as special cases in general arguments. There are seven degenerate planes . They are:\n\n\nThese seven cases are not independent, the fourth and fifth can be considered as special cases of the sixth, while the second and third are special cases of the fourth and fifth respectively. The seven cases can therefore be organized into two families of degenerate planes as follows (this representation is for finite degenerate planes, but may be extended to infinite ones in a natural way):\n\n1) For any number of points \"P\", ..., \"P\", and lines \"L\", ..., \"L\",\n\n2) For any number of points \"P\", ..., \"P\", and lines \"L\", ..., \"L\", (same number of points as lines)\n\nA collineation of a projective plane is a bijective map of the plane to itself which maps points to points and lines to lines that preserves incidence, meaning that if \"σ\" is a bijection and point P is on line m, then P is on m.\n\nIf \"σ\" is a collineation of a projective plane, a point P with P = P is called a fixed point of \"σ\", and a line m with m = m is called a fixed line of \"σ\". The points on a fixed line need not be fixed points, their images under \"σ\" are just constrained to lie on this line. The collection of fixed points and fixed lines of a collineation form a closed configuration, which is a system of points and lines that satisfy the first two but not necessarily the third condition in the definition of a projective plane. Thus, the fixed point and fixed line structure for any collineation either form a projective plane by themselves, or a degenerate plane. Collineations whose fixed structure forms a plane are called planar collineations.\n\nA homography (or \"projective transformation\") of PG(2,\"K\") is a collineation of this type of projective plane which is a linear transformation of the underlying vector space. Using homogeneous coordinates they can be represented by invertible 3 × 3 matrices over \"K\" which act on the points of PG(2,\"K\") by \"y\" = \"M\" \"x\", where \"x\" and \"y\" are points in \"K\" (vectors) and \"M\" is an invertible 3 × 3 matrix over \"K\". Two matrices represent the same projective transformation if one is a constant multiple of the other. Thus the group of projective transformations is the quotient of the general linear group by the scalar matrices called the projective linear group.\n\nAnother type of collineation of PG(2,\"K\") is induced by any automorphism of \"K\", these are called automorphic collineations. If α is an automorphism of \"K\", then the collineation given by (x,x,x) → (x,x,x) is an automorphic collineation. The fundamental theorem of projective geometry says that all the collineations of PG(2,\"K\") are compositions of homographies and automorphic collineations. Automorphic collineations are planar collineations.\n\nA projective plane is defined axiomatically as an incidence structure, in terms of a set \"P\" of points, a set \"L\" of lines, and an incidence relation \"I\" that determines which points lie on which lines. As P and L are only sets one can interchange their roles and define a plane dual structure.\n\nBy interchanging the role of \"points\" and \"lines\" in\nwe obtain the dual structure\nwhere \"I*\" is the inverse relation of \"I\".\n\nIn a projective plane a statement involving points, lines and incidence between them that is obtained from another such statement by interchanging the words \"point\" and \"line\" and making whatever grammatical adjustments that are necessary, is called the plane dual statement of the first. The plane dual statement of \"Two points are on a unique line.\" is \"Two lines meet at a unique point.\" Forming the plane dual of a statement is known as \"dualizing\" the statement.\n\nIf a statement is true in a projective plane C, then the plane dual of that statement must be true in the dual plane C*. This follows since dualizing each statement in the proof \"in C\" gives a statement of the proof \"in C*.\"\n\nIn the projective plane C, it can be shown that there exist four lines, no three of which are concurrent. Dualizing this theorem and the first two axioms in the definition of a projective plane shows that the plane dual structure C* is also a projective plane, called the dual plane of C.\n\nIf C and C* are isomorphic, then C is called self-dual. The projective planes PG(2,\"K\") for any division ring \"K\" are self-dual. However, there are non-Desarguesian planes which are not self-dual, such as the Hall planes and some that are, such as the Hughes planes.\n\nThe Principle of Plane Duality says that dualizing any theorem in a self-dual projective plane C produces another theorem valid in C.\n\nA duality is a map from a projective plane \"C\" = (\"P\", \"L\", I) to its dual plane \"C\"* = (\"L\", \"P\", I*) (see above) which preserves incidence. That is, a duality σ will map points to lines and lines to points (\"P\" = \"L\" and \"L\" = \"P\") in such a way that if a point \"Q\" is on a line \"m\" (denoted by \"Q\" I \"m\") then \"Q\" I* \"m\" ⇔ \"m\" I \"Q\". A duality which is an isomorphism is called a correlation. If a correlation exists then the projective plane \"C\" is self-dual.\n\nIn the special case that the projective plane is of the PG(2,\"K\") type, with \"K\" a division ring, a duality is called a reciprocity. These planes are always self-dual. By the fundamental theorem of projective geometry a reciprocity is the composition of an automorphic function of \"K\" and a homography. If the automorphism involved is the identity, then the reciprocity is called a projective correlation.\n\nA correlation of order two (an involution) is called a polarity. If a correlation φ is not a polarity then φ is a nontrivial collineation.\n\nIt can be shown that a projective plane has the same number of lines as it has points (infinite or finite). Thus, for every finite projective plane there is an integer \"N\" ≥ 2 such that the plane has\nThe number \"N\" is called the order of the projective plane. \n\nThe projective plane of order 2 is called the Fano plane. See also the article on finite geometry.\n\nUsing the vector space construction with finite fields there exists a projective plane of order \"N\" = \"p\", for each prime power \"p\". In fact, for all known finite projective planes, the order \"N\" is a prime power.\n\nThe existence of finite projective planes of other orders is an open question. The only general restriction known on the order is the Bruck-Ryser-Chowla theorem that if the order \"N\" is congruent to 1 or 2 mod 4, it must be the sum of two squares. This rules out \"N\" = 6. The next case \"N\" = 10 has been ruled out by massive computer calculations. Nothing more is known; in particular, the question of whether there exists a finite projective plane of order \"N\" = 12 is still open.\n\nAnother longstanding open problem is whether there exist finite projective planes of \"prime\" order which are not finite field planes (equivalently, whether there exists a non-Desarguesian projective plane of prime order).\n\nA projective plane of order \"N\" is a Steiner S(2, \"N\" + 1, \"N\" + \"N\" + 1) system\n(see Steiner system). Conversely, one can prove that all Steiner systems of this form (λ = 2) are projective planes.\n\nThe number of mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order \"N\" is at most \"N\" − 1. \"N\" − 1 exist if and only if there is a projective plane of order \"N\".\n\nWhile the classification of all projective planes is far from complete, results are known for small orders:\n\nProjective planes may be thought of as projective geometries of \"geometric\" dimension two. Higher-dimensional projective geometries can be defined in terms of incidence relations in a manner analogous to the definition of a projective plane. These turn out to be \"tamer\" than the projective planes since the extra degrees of freedom permit Desargues' theorem to be proved geometrically in the higher-dimensional geometry. This means that the coordinate \"ring\" associated to the geometry must be a division ring (skewfield) \"K\", and the projective geometry is isomorphic to the one constructed from the vector space \"K\", i.e. PG(\"d\",\"K\"). As in the construction given earlier, the points of the \"d\"-dimensional projective space PG(\"d\",\"K\") are the lines through the origin in \"K\" and a line in PG(\"d\",\"K\") corresponds to a plane through the origin in \"K\". In fact, each \"i-dimensional\" object in PG(\"d\",\"K\"), with \"i\" < \"d\", is an (\"i\" + 1)-dimensional (algebraic) vector subspace of \"K\" (\"goes through the origin\"). The projective spaces in turn generalize to the Grassmannian spaces.\n\nIt can be shown that if Desargues' theorem holds in a projective space of dimension greater than two, then it must also hold in all planes that are contained in that space. Since there are projective planes in which Desargues' theorem fails (non-Desarguesian planes), these planes can not be embedded in a higher-dimensional projective space. Only the planes from the vector space construction PG(2,\"K\") can appear in projective spaces of higher dimension. Some disciplines in mathematics restrict the meaning of projective plane to only this type of projective plane since otherwise general statements about projective spaces would always have to mention the exceptions when the geometric dimension is two.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25272", "title": "Quadratic reciprocity", "text": "Quadratic reciprocity\n\nIn number theory, the law of quadratic reciprocity is a theorem about modular arithmetic that gives conditions for the solvability of quadratic equations modulo prime numbers. Due to its subtlety, it has many formulations, but the most standard statement is: \n.</math>\n\nThis law allows the easy calculation of any Legendre symbol, making it possible to determine whether there is an integer solution for any quadratic equation of the form formula_1 for \"p\" an odd prime; that is, to determine the \"perfect squares\" mod \"p\". However, this is a non-constructive result: it gives no help at all for \"finding\" a specific solution; for this, one uses quadratic residues.\n\nThe theorem was conjectured by Euler and Legendre and first proved by Gauss. He refers to it as the \"fundamental theorem\" in the \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" and his papers, writing\n\nPrivately he referred to it as the \"golden theorem.\" He published six proofs, and two more were found in his posthumous papers. There are now over 240 published proofs.\n\nSince Gauss, generalizing the reciprocity law has been a leading problem in mathematics, and has been crucial to the development of much of the machinery of modern algebra, number theory, and algebraic geometry, culminating in Artin reciprocity, class field theory, and the Langlands program. \n\nQuadratic reciprocity arises from certain subtle factorization patterns involving perfect square numbers. In this section, we give examples which lead to the general case. \n\nConsider the polynomial formula_3 and its values for formula_4 The prime factorizations of these values are given as follows:\n\nThe prime factors formula_5 dividing formula_6 are formula_7, and every prime whose final digit is formula_8 or formula_9; no primes ending in formula_10 or formula_11 ever appear. Now, formula_5 is a prime factor of some formula_13 whenever formula_14, i.e. whenever formula_15, i.e. whenever 5 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_5. This happens for formula_17 and those primes with formula_18, and note that the latter numbers formula_19 and formula_20 are precisely the quadratic residues modulo formula_21. Therefore, except for formula_22, we have that formula_21 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_5 iff formula_5 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_21.\n\nThe law of quadratic reciprocity gives a similar characterization of prime divisors of formula_27 for any prime \"q\", which leads to a characterization for any integer formula_28.\n\nLet \"p\" be an odd prime. A number modulo \"p\" is a quadratic residue whenever it is congruent to a square (mod \"p\"); otherwise it is a quadratic non-residue. (\"Quadratic\" can be dropped if it is clear from the context.) Here we exclude zero as a special case. Then as a consequence of the fact that the multiplicative group of a finite field of order \"p\" is cyclic of order \"p-1\", the following statements hold:\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, these statements do \"not\" hold if the modulus is not prime. \nFor example, there are only 2 quadratic residues (1 and 4) in the multiplicative group modulo 15. \nMoreover although 7 and 8 are quadratic non-residues, their product 7x8 = 11 is also a quadratic non-residue, in contrast to the prime case. \n\nQuadratic residues are entries in the following table: \n\nThis table is complete for odd primes less than 50. To check whether a number \"m\" is a quadratic residue mod one of these primes \"p\", find \"a\" ≡ \"m\" (mod \"p\") and 0 ≤ \"a\" < \"p\". If \"a\" is in row \"p\", then \"m\" is a residue (mod \"p\"); if \"a\" is not in row \"p\" of the table, then \"m\" is a nonresidue (mod \"p\").\n\nThe quadratic reciprocity law is the statement that certain patterns found in the table are true in general.\n\nTrivially 1 is a quadratic residue for all primes. The question becomes more interesting for −1. Examining the table, we find −1 in rows 5, 13, 17, 29, 37, and 41 but not in rows 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 31, 43 or 47. The former set of primes are all congruent to 1 modulo 4, and the latter are congruent to 3 modulo 4.\n\nExamining the table, we find 2 in rows 7, 17, 23, 31, 41, and 47, but not in rows 3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 29, 37, or 43. The former primes are all ≡ ±1 (mod 8), and the latter are all ≡ ±3 (mod 8). This leads to\n\n−2 is in rows 3, 11, 17, 19, 41, 43, but not in rows 5, 7, 13, 23, 29, 31, 37, or 47. The former are ≡ 1 or ≡ 3 (mod 8), and the latter are ≡ 5, 7 (mod 8).\n\n3 is in rows 11, 13, 23, 37, and 47, but not in rows 5, 7, 17, 19, 29, 31, 41, or 43. The former are ≡ ±1 (mod 12) and the latter are all ≡ ±5 (mod 12).\n\n−3 is in rows 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, and 43 but not in rows 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 41, or 47. The former are ≡ 1 (mod 3) and the latter ≡ 2 (mod 3).\n\nSince the only residue (mod 3) is 1, we see that −3 is a quadratic residue modulo every prime which is a residue modulo 3.\n\n5 is in rows 11, 19, 29, 31, and 41 but not in rows 3, 7, 13, 17, 23, 37, 43, or 47. The former are ≡ ±1 (mod 5) and the latter are ≡ ±2 (mod 5).\n\nSince the only residues (mod 5) are ±1, we see that 5 is a quadratic residue modulo every prime which is a residue modulo 5.\n\n−5 is in rows 3, 7, 23, 29, 41, 43, and 47 but not in rows 11, 13, 17, 19, 31, or 37. The former are ≡ 1, 3, 7, 9 (mod 20) and the latter are ≡ 11, 13, 17, 19 (mod 20).\n\nThe observations about −3 and 5 continue to hold: −7 is a residue modulo \"p\" if and only if \"p\" is a residue modulo 7, −11 is a residue modulo \"p\" if and only if \"p\" is a residue modulo 11, 13 is a residue (mod \"p\") if and only if \"p\" is a residue modulo 13, etc. The more complicated-looking rules for the quadratic characters of 3 and −5, which depend upon congruences modulo 12 and 20 respectively, are simply the ones for −3 and 5 working with the first supplement.\n\nThe generalization of the rules for −3 and 5 is Gauss's statement of quadratic reciprocity.\n\nAnother way to organize the data is to see which primes are residues mod which other primes, as illustrated in the following table. The entry in row \"p\" column \"q\" is R if \"q\" is a quadratic residue (mod \"p\"); if it is a nonresidue the entry is N.\n\nIf the row, or the column, or both, are ≡ 1 (mod 4) the entry is blue or green; if both row and column are ≡ 3 (mod 4), it is yellow or orange.\n\nThe blue and green entries are symmetric around the diagonal: The entry for row \"p\", column \"q\" is R (resp N) if and only if the entry at row \"q\", column \"p\", is R (resp N).\n\nThe yellow and orange ones, on the other hand, are antisymmetric: The entry for row \"p\", column \"q\" is R (resp N) if and only if the entry at row \"q\", column \"p\", is N (resp R).\n\nThe reciprocity law states that these patterns hold for all \"p\" and \"q\".\n\nQuadratic Reciprocity (Gauss's Statement). If formula_33 then the congruence formula_34 is solvable if and only if formula_35 is solvable. If formula_36 then the congruence formula_34 is solvable if and only if formula_38 is solvable.\n\nQuadratic Reciprocity (Combined Statement). Define formula_39. Then the congruence formula_34 is solvable if and only if formula_41 is solvable.\n\nQuadratic Reciprocity (Legendre's Statement). If \"p\" or \"q\" are congruent to 1 modulo 4, then: formula_35 is solvable if and only if formula_34 is solvable. If \"p\" and \"q\" are congruent to 3 modulo 4, then: formula_35 is solvable if and only if formula_34 is not solvable.\n\nThe last is immediately equivalent to the modern form stated in the introduction above. It is a simple exercise to prove that Legendre's and Gauss's statements are equivalent – it requires no more than the first supplement and the facts about multiplying residues and nonresidues.\n\nThe theorem was formulated in many ways before its modern form: Euler and Legendre did not have Gauss's congruence notation, nor did Gauss have the Legendre symbol.\n\nIn this article \"p\" and \"q\" always refer to distinct positive odd primes, and \"x\" and \"y\" to unspecified integers.\n\nFermat proved (or claimed to have proved) a number of theorems about expressing a prime by a quadratic form:\n\nHe did not state the law of quadratic reciprocity, although the cases −1, ±2, and ±3 are easy deductions from these and other of his theorems.\n\nHe also claimed to have a proof that if the prime number \"p\" ends with 7, (in base 10) and the prime number \"q\" ends in 3, and \"p\" ≡ \"q\" ≡ 3 (mod 4), then\n\nEuler conjectured, and Lagrange proved, that\n\nProving these and other statements of Fermat was one of the things that led mathematicians to the reciprocity theorem.\n\nTranslated into modern notation, Euler stated that for distinct odd primes \"p\" and \"q\":\n\n\nThis is equivalent to quadratic reciprocity.\n\nHe could not prove it, but he did prove the second supplement.\n\nFermat proved that if \"p\" is a prime number and \"a\" is an integer, \n\nThus if \"p\" does not divide \"a\", using the non-obvious fact (see for example Ireland and Rosen below) that the residues modulo \"p\" form a field and therefore in particular the multiplicative group is cyclic, hence there can be at most two solutions to a quadratic equation: \n\nLegendre lets \"a\" and \"A\" represent positive primes ≡ 1 (mod 4) and \"b\" and \"B\" positive primes ≡ 3 (mod 4), and sets out a table of eight theorems that together are equivalent to quadratic reciprocity:\n\nHe says that since expressions of the form\n\nwill come up so often he will abbreviate them as:\n\nThis is now known as the Legendre symbol, and an equivalent definition is used today: for all integers \"a\" and all odd primes \"p\"\n\nHe notes that these can be combined:\n\nA number of proofs, especially those based on Gauss's Lemma, explicitly calculate this formula.\n\nLegendre's attempt to prove reciprocity is based on a theorem of his:\n\nExample. Theorem I is handled by letting \"a\" ≡ 1 and \"b\" ≡ 3 (mod 4) be primes and assuming that formula_59 and, contrary the theorem, that formula_60 Then formula_61 has a solution, and taking congruences (mod 4) leads to a contradiction.\n\nThis technique doesn't work for Theorem VIII. Let \"b\" ≡ \"B\" ≡ 3 (mod 4), and assume\n\nThen if there is another prime \"p\" ≡ 1 (mod 4) such that\n\nthe solvability of formula_64 leads to a contradiction (mod 4). But Legendre was unable to prove there has to be such a prime \"p\"; he was later able to show that all that is required is:\n\nbut he couldn't prove that either. Hilbert symbol (below) discusses how techniques based on the existence of solutions to formula_66 can be made to work.\n\nGauss first proves the supplementary laws. He sets the basis for induction by proving the theorem for ±3 and ±5. Noting that it is easier to state for −3 and +5 than it is for +3 or −5, he states the general theorem in the form:\n\nIntroducing the notation \"a\" R \"b\" (resp. \"a\" N \"b\") to mean \"a\" is a quadratic residue (resp. nonresidue) (mod \"b\"), and letting \"a\", \"a\"′, etc. represent positive primes ≡ 1 (mod 4) and \"b\", \"b\"′, etc. positive primes ≡ 3 (mod 4), he breaks it out into the same 8 cases as Legendre:\n\nIn the next Article he generalizes this to what are basically the rules for the Jacobi symbol (below). Letting \"A\", \"A\"′, etc. represent any (prime or composite) positive numbers ≡ 1 (mod 4) and \"B\", \"B\"′, etc. positive numbers ≡ 3 (mod 4):\n\nAll of these cases take the form \"if a prime is a residue (mod a composite), then the composite is a residue or nonresidue (mod the prime), depending on the congruences (mod 4)\". He proves that these follow from cases 1) - 8).\n\nGauss needed, and was able to prove, a lemma similar to the one Legendre needed:\n\nThe proof of quadratic reciprocity uses complete induction.\n\nThese can be combined:\n\nA number of proofs of the theorem, especially those based on Gauss sums derive this formula. or the splitting of primes in algebraic number fields,\n\nNote that the statements in this section are equivalent to quadratic reciprocity: if, for example, Euler's version is assumed, the Legendre-Gauss version can be deduced from it, and vice versa.\n\nThis can be proven using Gauss's lemma.\n\nGauss's fourth proof consists of proving this theorem (by comparing two formulas for the value of Gauss sums) and then restricting it to two primes. He then gives an example: Let \"a\" = 3, \"b\" = 5, \"c\" = 7, and \"d\" = 11. Three of these, 3, 7, and 11 ≡ 3 (mod 4), so \"m\" ≡ 3 (mod 4). 5×7×11 R 3; 3×7×11 R 5; 3×5×11 R 7;  and  3×5×7 N 11, so there are an odd number of nonresidues.\n\nThe Jacobi symbol is a generalization of the Legendre symbol; the main difference is that the bottom number has to be positive and odd, but does not have to be prime. If it is prime, the two symbols agree. It obeys the same rules of manipulation as the Legendre symbol. In particular\n\nand if both numbers are positive and odd (this is sometimes called \"Jacobi's reciprocity law\"):\n\nHowever, if the Jacobi symbol is 1 but the denominator is not a prime, it does not necessarily follow that the numerator is a quadratic residue of the denominator. Gauss's cases 9) - 14) above can be expressed in terms of Jacobi symbols:\n\nand since \"p\" is prime the left hand side is a Legendre symbol, and we know whether \"M\" is a residue modulo \"p\" or not.\n\nThe formulas listed in the preceding section are true for Jacobi symbols as long as the symbols are defined. Euler's formula may be written\n\nExample.\n\n2 is a residue modulo the primes 7, 23 and 31:\n\nBut 2 is not a quadratic residue modulo 5, so it can't be one modulo 15. This is related to the problem Legendre had: if formula_84 then \"a\" is a non-residue modulo every prime in the arithmetic progression \"m\" + 4\"a\", \"m\" + 8\"a\", ..., if there \"are\" any primes in this series, but that wasn't proved until decades after Legendre.\n\nEisenstein's formula requires relative primality conditions (which are true if the numbers are prime)\n\nThe quadratic reciprocity law can be formulated in terms of the Hilbert symbol formula_88 where \"a\" and \"b\" are any two nonzero rational numbers and \"v\" runs over all the non-trivial absolute values of the rationals (the archimedean one and the \"p\"-adic absolute values for primes \"p\"). The Hilbert symbol formula_88 is 1 or −1. It is defined to be 1 if and only if the equation formula_90 has a solution in the completion of the rationals at \"v\" other than formula_91. The Hilbert reciprocity law states that formula_88, for fixed \"a\" and \"b\" and varying \"v\", is 1 for all but finitely many \"v\" and the product of formula_88 over all \"v\" is 1. (This formally resembles the residue theorem from complex analysis.)\n\nThe proof of Hilbert reciprocity reduces to checking a few special cases, and the non-trivial cases turn out to be equivalent to the main law and the two supplementary laws of quadratic reciprocity for the Legendre symbol. There is no kind of reciprocity in the Hilbert reciprocity law; its name simply indicates the historical source of the result in quadratic reciprocity. Unlike quadratic reciprocity, which requires sign conditions (namely positivity of the primes involved) and a special treatment of the prime 2, the Hilbert reciprocity law treats all absolute values of the rationals on an equal footing. Therefore, it is a more natural way of expressing quadratic reciprocity with a view towards generalization: the Hilbert reciprocity law extends with very few changes to all global fields and this extension can rightly be considered a generalization of quadratic reciprocity to all global fields.\n\nThe early proofs of quadratic reciprocity are relatively unilluminating. The situation changed when Gauss used Gauss sums to show that quadratic fields are subfields of cyclotomic fields, and implicitly deduced quadratic reciprocity from a reciprocity theorem for cyclotomic fields. His proof was cast in modern form by later algebraic number theorists. This proof served as a template for class field theory, which can be viewed as a vast generalization of quadratic reciprocity.\n\nRobert Langlands formulated the Langlands program, which gives a conjectural vast generalization of class field theory. He wrote:\n\nThere are also quadratic reciprocity laws in rings other than the integers.\n\nIn his second monograph on quartic reciprocity Gauss stated quadratic reciprocity for the ring formula_94 of Gaussian integers, saying that it is a corollary of the biquadratic law in formula_95 but did not provide a proof of either theorem. Dirichlet showed that the law in formula_94 can be deduced from the law for formula_97 without using biquadratic reciprocity.\n\nFor an odd Gaussian prime formula_98 and a Gaussian integer formula_99 relatively prime to formula_100 define the quadratic character for formula_94 by:\n\nLet formula_103 be distinct Gaussian primes where \"a\" and \"c\" are odd and \"b\" and \"d\" are even. Then\n\nConsider the following third root of unity:\n\nThe ring of Eisenstein integers is formula_106 For an Eisenstein prime formula_107 and an Eisenstein integer formula_99 with formula_109 define the quadratic character for formula_110 by the formula\n\nLet λ = \"a\" + \"bω\" and μ = \"c\" + \"dω\" be distinct Eisenstein primes where \"a\" and \"c\" are not divisible by 3 and \"b\" and \"d\" are divisible by 3. Eisenstein proved\n\nThe above laws are special cases of more general laws that hold for the ring of integers in any imaginary quadratic number field.

In 1923 Emil Artin, building upon work by Philipp Furtwängler, Teiji Takagi, Helmut Hasse and others, discovered a general theorem for which all known reciprocity laws are special cases; he proved it in 1927.\n\nThe links below provide more detailed discussions of these theorems.\n\nThe \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" has been translated (from Latin) into English and German. The German edition includes all of Gauss's papers on number theory: all the proofs of quadratic reciprocity, the determination of the sign of the Gauss sum, the investigations into biquadratic reciprocity, and unpublished notes. Footnotes referencing the \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" are of the form \"Gauss, DA, Art. \"n\"\".\n\nThe two monographs Gauss published on biquadratic reciprocity have consecutively numbered sections: the first contains §§ 1–23 and the second §§ 24–76. Footnotes referencing these are of the form \"Gauss, BQ, § \"n\"\". \n\nThese are in Gauss's \"Werke\", Vol II, pp. 65–92 and 93–148. German translations are in pp. 511–533 and 534–586 of \"Untersuchungen über höhere Arithmetik.\"\n\nEvery textbook on elementary number theory (and quite a few on algebraic number theory) has a proof of quadratic reciprocity. Two are especially noteworthy:\n\nFranz Lemmermeyer's \"Reciprocity Laws: From Euler to Eisenstein\" has \"many\" proofs (some in exercises) of both quadratic and higher-power reciprocity laws and a discussion of their history. Its immense bibliography includes literature citations for 196 different published proofs for the quadratic reciprocity law.\n\nKenneth Ireland and Michael Rosen's \"A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory\" also has many proofs of quadratic reciprocity (and many exercises), and covers the cubic and biquadratic cases as well.

{"id": "546120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=546120", "title": "Recurrence plot", "text": "Recurrence plot\n\nIn descriptive statistics and chaos theory, a recurrence plot (RP) is a plot showing, for a given moment in time, the times at which a phase space trajectory visits roughly the same area in the phase space. In other words, it is a graph of\n\nshowing formula_2 on a horizontal axis and formula_3 on a vertical axis, where formula_4 is a phase space trajectory.\n\nNatural processes can have a distinct recurrent behaviour, e.g. periodicities (as seasonal or Milankovich cycles), but also irregular cyclicities (as El Niño Southern Oscillation). Moreover, the recurrence of states, in the meaning that states are again arbitrarily close after some time of divergence, is a fundamental property of deterministic dynamical systems and is typical for nonlinear or chaotic systems (cf. Poincaré recurrence theorem). The recurrence of states in nature has been known for a long time and has also been discussed in early work (e.g. Henri Poincaré 1890).\n\nEckmann et al. (1987) introduced recurrence plots, which provide a way to visualize the periodic nature of a trajectory through a phase space. Often, the phase space does not have a low enough dimension (two or three) to be pictured, since higher-dimensional phase spaces can only be visualized by projection into the two or three-dimensional sub-spaces. However, making a recurrence plot enables us to investigate certain aspects of the \"m\"-dimensional phase space trajectory through a two-dimensional representation.\n\nA recurrence is a time the trajectory returns to a location it has visited before. The recurrence plot depicts the collection of pairs of times at which the trajectory is at the same place, i.e. the set of formula_5 with formula_6. This can show many things, for instance, if the trajectory is strictly periodic with period formula_7, then all such pairs of times will be separated by a multiple of formula_7 and visible as diagonal lines. To make the plot, continuous time and continuous phase space are discretized, taking e.g. formula_9 as the location of the trajectory at time formula_10 and counting as a recurrence any time the trajectory gets sufficiently close (say, within ε) to a point it has been previously. Concretely then, recurrence/non-recurrence can be recorded by the binary function\n\nand the recurrence plot puts a (black) point at coordinates formula_5 if formula_13.\n\nCaused by characteristic behaviour of the phase space trajectory, a recurrence plot contains typical small-scale structures, as single dots, diagonal lines and vertical/horizontal lines (or a mixture of the latter, which combines to extended clusters). The large-scale structure, also called \"texture\", can be visually characterised by \"homogenous\", \"periodic\", \"drift\" or \"disrupted\". The visual appearance of an RP gives hints about the dynamics of the system.\n\nThe small-scale structures in RPs are used by the recurrence quantification analysis (Zbilut & Webber 1992; Marwan et al. 2002). This quantification allows to describe the RPs in a quantitative way, and to study transitions or nonlinear parameters of the system. In contrast to the heuristic approach of the recurrence quantification analysis, which depends on the choice of the embedding parameters, some dynamical invariants as correlation dimension, K2 entropy or mutual information, which are independent on the embedding, can also be derived from recurrence plots. The base for these dynamical invariants are the recurrence rate and the distribution of the lengths of the diagonal lines.\n\nClose returns plots are similar to recurrence plots. The difference is that the relative time between recurrences is used for the formula_14-axis (instead of absolute time).\n\nThe main advantage of recurrence plots is that they provide useful information even for short and non-stationary data, where other methods fail.\n\nMultivariate extensions of recurrence plots were developed as cross recurrence plots and joint recurrence plots.\n\nCross recurrence plots consider the phase space trajectories of two different systems in the same phase space (Marwan & Kurths 2002):\n\nThe dimension of both systems must be the same, but the number of considered states (i.e. data length) can be different. Cross recurrence plots compare the occurrences of \"similar states\" of two systems. They can be used in order to analyse the similarity of the dynamical evolution between two different systems, to look for similar matching patterns in two systems, or to study the time-relationship of two similar systems, whose time-scale differ (Marwan & Kurths 2005).\n\nJoint recurrence plots are the Hadamard product of the recurrence plots of the considered sub-systems (Romano et al. 2004), e.g. for two systems formula_4 and formula_17 the joint recurrence plot is\n\nIn contrast to cross recurrence plots, joint recurrence plots compare the simultaneous occurrence of \"recurrences\" in two (or more) systems. Moreover, the dimension of the considered phase spaces can be different, but the number of the considered states has to be the same for all the sub-systems. Joint recurrence plots can be used in order to detect phase synchronisation.\n\n\n"}

In econometric studies, for example, the ridit scores measuring taste survey answers of a competing or historically important product are often used as the reference data set against which taste surveys of new products are compared. Absent a convenient reference data set, an accumulation of pooled data from several sets or even an artificial or hypothetical set can be used.\n\nAfter a reference data set has been chosen, the reference data set must be converted to a probability function. To do this, let \"x\", \"x\"..., \"x\" denote the ordered categories of the preference scale. For each \"j\", \"x\" represents a choice or judgment. Then, let the probability function \"p\" be defined with respect to the reference data set as\n\nThe ridit scores, or simply ridits, of the reference data set are then easily calculated as\n\nEach of the categories of the reference data set are then associated with a ridit score.\nMore formally, for each formula_3, the value \"w\" is the ridit score of the choice \"x\".\n\nIntuitively, ridit scoring can be understood as a modified notion of percentile. For any j, if \"x\" has a low (close to 0) ridit score, one can conclude that\nis very small, which is to say that very few respondents have chosen a category \"lower\" than \"x\".\n\nRidit scoring has found use primarily in the health sciences (including nursing and epidemiology) and econometric preference studies.\n\nBesides having intuitive appeal, the derivation for ridit scoring can be arrived at with mathematically rigorous methods as well. Brockett and Levine presented a derivation of the above ridit score equations based on several intuitively uncontroversial mathematical postulates.\n\n\nR statistical computing package for Ridit Analysis: https://cran.r-project.org/package=Ridit\n"}

It is an abbreviated form of long division. Short division relies on mental arithmetic, which necessarily limits the size of the divisor. For most people, small integer divisors up to 12 are handled using memorised multiplication tables, though some people can use the procedure for larger divisors.\n\nAs in all division problems, a number called the \"dividend\" is divided by another, called the \"divisor\". The answer to the problem is called the \"quotient\".\n\nUsing short division, one can solve a division problem with a very large dividend by following a series of easy steps.\n\nShort division does not use the \"slash\" (/) or \"obelus\" (÷) symbols. Instead, it displays the dividend, divisor, and quotient (when it is found) in a tableau. An example is shown below, representing the division of 500 by 4. The quotient is 125.\n\nAlternatively the bar may be placed below the number which means the sum proceeds down the page. This is in distinction to long division where the space under the dividend is required for workings:\n\nThe procedure involves several steps. As an example, consider 950 divided by 4:\n\nUsing the alternative layout the final workings would be:\n\nA common requirement is to reduce a number to its prime factors. This is used particularly in working with vulgar fractions. The dividend is successively divided by prime numbers, repeating where possible:\n\nSo 950 = 2 x 5² x 19\n\nWhen one is interested only in the remainder of the division, this procedure (a variation of short division) ignores the quotient and tallies only the remainders. It can be used for manual modulo calculation or as a test for even divisibility.\nThe quotient digits are not written down.\n\nFor example, what is the remainder of 16762109 divided by 7?\n\nThe remainder is zero, so 16762109 is exactly divisible by 7.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the central results in extremal set theory, and is named after Emanuel Sperner, who published it in 1928.\n\nThis result is sometimes called Sperner's lemma, but the name \"Sperner's lemma\" also refers to an unrelated result on coloring triangulations. To differentiate the two results, the result on the size of a Sperner family is now more commonly known as Sperner's theorem.\n\nA family of sets that does not include two sets \"X\" and \"Y\" for which \"X\" ⊂ \"Y\" is called a Sperner family. For example, the family of \"k\"-element subsets of an \"n\"-element set is a Sperner family. No set in this family can contain any of the others, because a containing set has to be strictly bigger than the set it contains, and in this family all sets have equal size. The value of \"k\" that makes this example have as many sets as possible is \"n\"/2 if \"n\" is even, or the nearest integer to \"n\"/2 if \"n\" is odd. For this choice, the number of sets in the family is formula_1.\n\nSperner's theorem states that these examples are the largest possible Sperner families over an \"n\"-element set.\nFormally, the theorem states that, for every Sperner family \"S\" whose union has a total of \"n\" elements,\n\nSperner's theorem can also be stated in terms of partial order width. The family of all subsets of an \"n\"-element set (its power set) can be partially ordered by set inclusion; in this partial order, two distinct elements are said to be incomparable when neither of them contains the other. The width of a partial order is the largest number of elements in an antichain, a set of pairwise incomparable elements. Translating this terminology into the language of sets, an antichain is just a Sperner family, and the width of the partial order is the maximum number of sets in a Sperner family.\nThus, another way of stating Sperner's theorem is that the width of the inclusion order on a power set is formula_3.\n\nA graded partially ordered set is said to have the Sperner property when one of its largest antichains is formed by a set of elements that all have the same rank. In this terminology, Sperner's theorem states that the partially ordered set of all subsets of a finite set, partially ordered by set inclusion, has the Sperner property.\n\nThe following proof is due to . Let \"s\" denote the number of \"k\"-sets in \"S\". For all 0 ≤ \"k\" ≤ \"n\",\n\nand, thus,\n\nSince \"S\" is an antichain, we can sum over the above inequality from \"k\" = 0 to \"n\" and then apply the LYM inequality to obtain\n\nwhich means\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nThere are several generalizations of Sperner's theorem for subsets of formula_8 the poset of all subsets of \"E\".\n\nA chain is a subfamily formula_9 that is totally ordered, i.e., formula_10 (possibly after renumbering). The chain has \"r\" + 1 members and length \"r\". An \"r-chain-free family (also called an \"r-family) is a family of subsets of \"E\" that contains no chain of length \"r\". proved that the largest size of an \"r\"-chain-free family is the sum of the \"r\" largest binomial coefficients formula_11. The case \"r\" = 1 is Sperner's theorem.\n\nIn the set formula_12 of \"p\"-tuples of subsets of \"E\", we say a \"p\"-tuple formula_13 is ≤ another one, formula_14 if formula_15 for each \"i\" = 1,2...,\"p\". We call formula_13 a \"p\"-composition of \"E\" if the sets formula_17 form a partition of \"E\". proved that the maximum size of an antichain of \"p\"-compositions is the largest \"p\"-multinomial coefficient formula_18 that is, the coefficient in which all \"n\" are as nearly equal as possible (i.e., they differ by at most 1). Meshalkin proved this by proving a generalized LYM inequality.\n\nThe case \"p\" = 2 is Sperner's theorem, because then formula_19 and the assumptions reduce to the sets formula_20 being a Sperner family.\n\n combined the Erdös and Meshalkin theorems by adapting Meshalkin's proof of his generalized LYM inequality. They showed that the largest size of a family of \"p\"-compositions such that the sets in the \"i\"-th position of the \"p\"-tuples, ignoring duplications, are \"r\"-chain-free, for every formula_21 (but not necessarily for \"i\" = \"p\"), is not greater than the sum of the formula_22 largest \"p\"-multinomial coefficients.\n\nIn the finite projective geometry PG(\"d\", \"F\") of dimension \"d\" over a finite field of order \"q\", let formula_23 be the family of all subspaces. When partially ordered by set inclusion, this family is a lattice. proved that the largest size of an antichain in formula_23 is the largest Gaussian coefficient formula_25 this is the projective-geometry analog, or \"q\"-analog, of Sperner's theorem.\n\nThey further proved that the largest size of an \"r\"-chain-free family in formula_23 is the sum of the \"r\" largest Gaussian coefficients. Their proof is by a projective analog of the LYM inequality.\n\n obtained a Meshalkin-like generalization of the Rota–Harper theorem. In PG(\"d\", \"F\"), a Meshalkin sequence of length \"p\" is a sequence formula_27 of projective subspaces such that no proper subspace of PG(\"d\", \"F\") contains them all and their dimensions sum to formula_28. The theorem is that a family of Meshalkin sequences of length \"p\" in PG(\"d\", \"F\"), such that the subspaces appearing in position \"i\" of the sequences contain no chain of length \"r\" for each formula_29 is not more than the sum of the largest formula_22 of the quantities \nwhere formula_32 (in which we assume that formula_33) denotes the \"p\"-Gaussian coefficient \nand \nthe second elementary symmetric function of the numbers formula_36\n\n\n\n"}

Very roughly, it consists of functions with zeros of order \"n\" along the variety defined by formula_2. We have: formula_13 and if is a maximal ideal, then formula_14.\n\nSymbolic powers induce the following chain of ideals:\n\nThe study and use of symbolic powers has a long history in commutative algebra. Krull’s famous proof of his principal ideal theorem uses them in an essential way. They first arose after primary decompositions were proved for Noetherian rings. Zariski used symbolic powers in his study of the analytic normality of algebraic varieties. Chevalley's famous lemma comparing topologies states that in a complete local domain the symbolic powers topology of any prime is finer than the \"m\"-adic topology. A crucial step in the vanishing theorem on local cohomology of Hartshorne and Lichtenbaum uses that for a prime formula_2 defining a curve in a complete local domain, the powers of formula_2 are cofinal with the symbolic powers of formula_2. This important property of being cofinal was further developed by Schenzel in the 1970s.\n\nThough generators for \"ordinary powers\" of formula_2 are well understood when formula_2 is given in terms of its generators as formula_21, it is still very difficult in many cases to determine the generators of symbolic powers of formula_2. But in the geometric setting, there is a clear geometric interpretation in the case when formula_2 is a radical ideal over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.\n\nIf formula_24 is an irreducible variety whose ideal of vanishing is formula_2, then the \"differential power\" of formula_2 consists of all the functions in formula_1 that vanish\nto order ≥ \"n\" on formula_24, i.e.\n\nOr equivalently, if formula_30 is the maximal ideal for a point formula_31, formula_32.\n\nTheorem (Nagata, Zariski) Let formula_2 be a prime ideal in a polynomial ring formula_34 over an algebraically closed field. Then\nThis result can be extended to any radical ideal. This formulation is very useful because, in characteristic zero, we can compute the differential powers in terms of generators as:\n\nFor another formulation, we can consider the case when the base ring is a polynomial ring over a field. In this case, we can interpret the \"n\"-th symbolic power as the sheaf of all function germs over formula_37\nIn fact, if formula_24 is a smooth variety over a perfect field, then\n\nIt is natural to consider whether or not symbolic powers agree with ordinary powers, i.e. does formula_40 hold? In general this is not the case. One example of this is the prime ideal formula_41. Here we have that formula_42. However, formula_43 does hold and the generalization of this containment is well understood. Indeed, the containment formula_44follows from the definition. Further, it is known that formula_45 if and only if formula_46. The proof follows from Nakayama's lemma.\n\nThere has been extensive study into the other containment, when symbolic powers are contained in ordinary powers of ideals, referred to as the Containment Problem. Once again this has an easily stated answer summarized in the following theorem. It was developed by Ein, Lazarfeld, and Smith in characteristic zero and was expanded to positive characteristic by Hochster and Huneke. Their papers both build upon the results of Irena Swanson in \"Linear Equivalence of Ideal Topologies\" (2000).\n\nTheorem (Ein, Lazarfeld, Smith; Hochster, Huneke) Let formula_47 be a homogeneous ideal.

Discrete translational symmetry is invariant under discrete translation.\n\nAnalogously an operator \"A\" on functions is said to be translationally invariant with respect to a translation operator formula_1 if the result after applying \"A\" doesn't change if the argument function is translated.\nMore precisely it must hold that\n\nLaws of physics are translationally invariant under a spatial translation if they do not distinguish different points in space. According to Noether's theorem, space translational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the momentum conservation law.\n\nTranslational symmetry of an object means that a particular translation does not change the object. For a given object, the translations for which this applies form a group, the symmetry group of the object, or, if the object has more kinds of symmetry, a subgroup of the symmetry group.\n\nTranslational invariance implies that, at least in one direction, the object is infinite: for any given point p, the set of points with the same properties due to the translational symmetry form the infinite discrete set {p + \"n\"a|\"n\" ∈ Z} = p + Z a. Fundamental domains are e.g. H + [0, 1] a for any hyperplane H for which a has an independent direction. This is in 1D a line segment, in 2D an infinite strip, and in 3D a slab, such that the vector starting at one side ends at the other side. Note that the strip and slab need not be perpendicular to the vector, hence can be narrower or thinner than the length of the vector.\n\nIn spaces with dimension higher than 1, there may be multiple translational symmetry. For each set of \"k\" independent translation vectors, the symmetry group is isomorphic with Z. \nIn particular, the multiplicity may be equal to the dimension. This implies that the object is infinite in all directions. In this case, the set of all translations forms a lattice. Different bases of translation vectors generate the same lattice if and only if one is transformed into the other by a matrix of integer coefficients of which the absolute value of the determinant is 1. The absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by a set of translation vectors is the hypervolume of the \"n\"-dimensional parallelepiped the set subtends (also called the \"covolume\" of the lattice). This parallelepiped is a fundamental region of the symmetry: any pattern on or in it is possible, and this defines the whole object. \nSee also lattice (group). \n\nE.g. in 2D, instead of a and b we can also take a and a − b, etc. In general in 2D, we can take \"pa + \"qb and \"ra + \"sb for integers \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", and \"s\" such that \"ps\" − \"qr\" is 1 or −1. This ensures that a and b themselves are integer linear combinations of the other two vectors. If not, not all translations are possible with the other pair. Each pair a, b defines a parallelogram, all with the same area, the magnitude of the cross product. One parallelogram fully defines the whole object. Without further symmetry, this parallelogram is a fundamental domain. The vectors a and b can be represented by complex numbers. For two given lattice points, equivalence of choices of a third point to generate a lattice shape is represented by the modular group, see lattice (group).\nAlternatively, e.g. a rectangle may define the whole object, even if the translation vectors are not perpendicular, if it has two sides parallel to one translation vector, while the other translation vector starting at one side of the rectangle ends at the opposite side.\n\nFor example, consider a tiling with equal rectangular tiles with an asymmetric pattern on them, all oriented the same, in rows, with for each row a shift of a fraction, not one half, of a tile, always the same, then we have only translational symmetry, wallpaper group \"p\"1 (the same applies without shift). With rotational symmetry of order two of the pattern on the tile we have \"p\"2 (more symmetry of the pattern on the tile does not change that, because of the arrangement of the tiles). The rectangle is a more convenient unit to consider as fundamental domain (or set of two of them) than a parallelogram consisting of part of a tile and part of another one.\n\nIn 2D there may be translational symmetry in one direction for vectors of any length. One line, not in the same direction, fully defines the whole object. Similarly, in 3D there may be translational symmetry in one or two directions for vectors of any length. One plane (cross-section) or line, respectively, fully defines the whole object.\n\nAn example of translational symmetry in one direction in 2D nr. 1) is:\n\nNote: The example is not an example of rotational symmetry.\n\n(get the same by moving one line down and two positions to the right), and of translational symmetry in two directions in 2D (wallpaper group p1):\n\n(get the same by moving three positions to the right, or one line down and two positions to the right; consequently get also the same moving three lines down). \n\nIn both cases there is neither mirror-image symmetry nor rotational symmetry.\n\nFor a given translation of space we can consider the corresponding translation of objects. The objects with at least the corresponding translational symmetry are the fixed points of the latter, not to be confused with fixed points of the translation of space, which are non-existent.\n\n\n\n"}
