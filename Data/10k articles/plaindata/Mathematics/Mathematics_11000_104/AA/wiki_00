The theorem has two forms, each of which gives sufficient conditions for a topological space to be a Baire space.\n\nThe theorem was proved by René-Louis Baire in his 1899 doctoral thesis.\n\nA Baire space is a topological space with the following property: for each countable collection of open dense sets formula_1, their intersection formula_2 is dense.\n\n\nNote that neither of these statements implies the other, since there are complete metric spaces which are not locally compact (the irrational numbers with the metric defined below; also, any Banach space of infinite dimension), and there are locally compact Hausdorff spaces which are not metrizable (for instance, any uncountable product of non-trivial compact Hausdorff spaces is such; also, several function spaces used in Functional Analysis; the uncountable Fort space). See Steen and Seebach in the references below.\n\n\nThis formulation is equivalent to BCT1 and is sometimes more useful in applications. Also: if a non-empty complete metric space is the countable union of closed sets, then one of these closed sets has \"non-empty\" interior.\n\nThe proofs of BCT1 and BCT2 for arbitrary complete metric spaces require some form of the axiom of choice; and in fact BCT1 is equivalent over ZF to a weak form of the axiom of choice called the axiom of dependent choices.\n\nA restricted form of the Baire category theorem, in which the complete metric space is also assumed to be separable, is provable in ZF with no additional choice principles. This restricted form applies in particular to the real line, the Baire space ω, the Cantor space 2, and a separable Hilbert space such as \"L\"(\"R\" ).\n\nBCT1 is used in functional analysis to prove the open mapping theorem, the closed graph theorem and the uniform boundedness principle.\n\nBCT1 also shows that every complete metric space with no isolated points is uncountable. (If \"X\" is a countable complete metric space with no isolated points, then each singleton {\"x\"} in \"X\" is nowhere dense, and so \"X\" is of first category in itself.) In particular, this proves that the set of all real numbers is uncountable.\n\nBCT1 shows that each of the following is a Baire space:\n\nBy BCT2, every finite-dimensional Hausdorff manifold is a Baire space, since it is locally compact and Hausdorff. This is so even for non-paracompact (hence nonmetrizable) manifolds such as the long line.\n\nThe following is a standard proof that a complete pseudometric space formula_8 is a Baire space.\n\nLet formula_9 be a countable collection of open dense subsets. We want to show that the intersection formula_10 is dense. A subset is dense if and only if every nonempty open subset intersects it. Thus, to show that the intersection is dense, it is sufficient to show that any nonempty open set formula_11 in formula_12 has a point formula_13 in common with all of the formula_9. Since formula_15 is dense, formula_11 intersects formula_15; thus, there is a point formula_18 and formula_19 such that:\n\nwhere formula_21 and formula_22 denote an open and closed ball, respectively, centered at formula_13 with radius formula_24. Since each formula_9 is dense, we can continue recursively to find a pair of sequences formula_26 and formula_27 such that:\n\n(This step relies on the axiom of choice.) Since formula_29 when formula_30, we have that formula_26 is Cauchy, and hence formula_26 converges to some limit formula_6 by completeness.

For a continuous function of a single variable, being of bounded variation means that the distance along the direction of the -axis, neglecting the contribution of motion along -axis, traveled by a point moving along the graph has a finite value. For a continuous function of several variables, the meaning of the definition is the same, except for the fact that the continuous path to be considered cannot be the whole graph of the given function (which is a hypersurface in this case), but can be every intersection of the graph itself with a hyperplane (in the case of functions of two variables, a plane) parallel to a fixed -axis and to the -axis.\n\nFunctions of bounded variation are precisely those with respect to which one may find Riemann–Stieltjes integrals of all continuous functions.\n\nAnother characterization states that the functions of bounded variation on a compact interval are exactly those which can be written as a difference , where both and are bounded monotone.\n\nIn the case of several variables, a function defined on an open subset of ℝ\"\" is said to have bounded variation if its distributional derivative is a vector-valued finite Radon measure.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of functions of bounded variation is that they form an algebra of discontinuous functions whose first derivative exists almost everywhere: due to this fact, they can and frequently are used to define generalized solutions of nonlinear problems involving functionals, ordinary and partial differential equations in mathematics, physics and engineering.\n\nWe have the following chains of inclusions for functions over a compact subset of the real line:\n\nAccording to Boris Golubov, \"BV\" functions of a single variable were first introduced by Camille Jordan, in the paper dealing with the convergence of Fourier series. The first successful step in the generalization of this concept to functions of several variables was due to Leonida Tonelli, who introduced a class of \"continuous\" \"BV\" functions in 1926 , to extend his direct method for finding solutions to problems in the calculus of variations in more than one variable. Ten years after, in , Lamberto Cesari \"changed the continuity requirement\" in Tonelli's definition \"to a less restrictive integrability requirement\", obtaining for the first time the class of functions of bounded variation of several variables in its full generality: as Jordan did before him, he applied the concept to resolve of a problem concerning the convergence of Fourier series, but for functions of \"two variables\". After him, several authors applied \"BV\" functions to study Fourier series in several variables, geometric measure theory, calculus of variations, and mathematical physics. Renato Caccioppoli and Ennio de Giorgi used them to define measure of nonsmooth boundaries of sets (see the entry \"Caccioppoli set\" for further information). Olga Arsenievna Oleinik introduced her view of generalized solutions for nonlinear partial differential equations as functions from the space \"BV\" in the paper , and was able to construct a generalized solution of bounded variation of a first order partial differential equation in the paper : few years later, Edward D. Conway and Joel A. Smoller applied \"BV\"-functions to the study of a single nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation of first order in the paper , proving that the solution of the Cauchy problem for such equations is a function of bounded variation, provided the initial value belongs to the same class. Aizik Isaakovich Vol'pert developed extensively a calculus for \"BV\" functions: in the paper he proved the chain rule for BV functions and in the book he, jointly with his pupil Sergei Ivanovich Hudjaev, explored extensively the properties of \"BV\" functions and their application. His chain rule formula was later extended by Luigi Ambrosio and Gianni Dal Maso in the paper .\n\n The total variation of a real-valued (or more generally complex-valued) function \"f\", defined on an interval [\"a\", \"b\"]⊂ℝ is the quantity\n\nwhere the supremum is taken over the set formula_2 of all partitions of the interval considered.\n\nIf \"f\" is differentiable and its derivative is Riemann-integrable, its total variation is the vertical component of the arc-length of its graph, that is to say,\n\nIt can be proved that a real function \"ƒ\" is of bounded variation in formula_6 if and only if it can be written as the difference \"ƒ\" = \"ƒ\" − \"ƒ\" of two non-decreasing functions on formula_6: this result is known as the Jordan decomposition of a function and it is related to the Jordan decomposition of a measure.\n\nThrough the Stieltjes integral, any function of bounded variation on a closed interval [\"a\", \"b\"] defines a bounded linear functional on \"C\"([\"a\", \"b\"]). In this special case, the Riesz representation theorem states that every bounded linear functional arises uniquely in this way. The normalised positive functionals or probability measures correspond to positive non-decreasing lower semicontinuous functions. This point of view has been important in\nspectral theory, in particular in its application to ordinary differential equations.\n\nFunctions of bounded variation, BV functions, are functions whose distributional derivative is a Radon measure. More precisely:\n\nif there exists a finite vector Radon measure formula_12 such that the following equality holds\n\nthat is, formula_14 defines a linear functional on the space formula_15 of continuously differentiable vector functions formula_16 of compact support contained in formula_8: the vector measure formula_18 represents therefore the distributional or weak gradient of formula_14.\n\nAn equivalent definition is the following.\n\nwhere formula_25 is the essential supremum norm. Sometimes, especially in the theory of Caccioppoli sets, the following notation is used\n\nin order to emphasize that formula_27 is the total variation of the distributional / weak gradient of formula_14. This notation reminds also that if formula_14 is of class formula_30 (i.e. a continuous and differentiable function having continuous derivatives) then its variation is exactly the integral of the absolute value of its gradient.\n\nThe space of functions of bounded variation (BV functions) can then be defined as\n\nThe two definitions are equivalent since if formula_32 then\n\ntherefore formula_34 defines a continuous linear functional on\nthe space formula_35. Since formula_36 as a linear subspace, this continuous linear functional can be extended continuously and linearily to the whole formula_37 by the Hahn–Banach theorem. Hence the continuous linear functional defines a Radon measure by the Riesz-Markov Theorem.\n\nIf the function space of locally integrable functions, i.e. functions belonging to formula_38, is considered in the preceding definitions , and instead of the one of globally integrable functions, then the function space defined is that of functions of locally bounded variation. Precisely, developing this idea for , a local variation is defined as follows,\nfor every set formula_40, having defined formula_41 as the set of all precompact open subsets of formula_23 with respect to the standard topology of finite-dimensional vector spaces, and correspondingly the class of functions of locally bounded variation is defined as\n\nThere are basically two distinct conventions for the notation of spaces of functions of locally or globally bounded variation, and unfortunately they are quite similar: the first one, which is the one adopted in this entry, is used for example in references (partially), (partially), and is the following one\nThe second one, which is adopted in references and (partially), is the following:\n\nOnly the properties common to functions of one variable and to functions of several variables will be considered in the following, and proofs will be carried on only for functions of several variables since the proof for the case of one variable is a straightforward adaptation of the several variables case: also, in each section it will be stated if the property is shared also by functions of locally bounded variation or not. References , and are extensively used.\n\nIn the case of one variable, the assertion is clear: for each point formula_48 in the interval formula_49⊂ℝ of definition of the function formula_14, either one of the following two assertions is true\n\nwhile both limits exist and are finite. In the case of functions of several variables, there are some premises to understand: first of all, there is a continuum of directions along which it is possible to approach a given point formula_48 belonging to the domain formula_23⊂ℝ\"\". It is necessary to make precise a suitable concept of limit: choosing a unit vector formula_55 it is possible to divide formula_23 in two sets\n\nThen for each point formula_48 belonging to the domain formula_59 of the \"BV\" function formula_14, only one of the following two assertions is true\n\nor formula_48 belongs to a subset of formula_23 having zero formula_65-dimensional Hausdorff measure. The quantities\n\nare called approximate limits of the \"BV\" function formula_14 at the point formula_48.\n\nThe functional formula_69 is lower semi-continuous:\nto see this, choose a Cauchy sequence of \"BV\"-functions formula_70 converging to formula_71. Then, since all the functions of the sequence and their limit function are integrable and by the definition of lower limit\n\nNow considering the supremum on the set of functions formula_73 such that formula_74 then the following inequality holds true\n\nwhich is exactly the definition of lower semicontinuity.\n\nBy definition formula_76 is a subset of formula_10, while linearity follows from the linearity properties of the defining integral i.e.\n\nfor all formula_79 therefore formula_80for all formula_81, and\n\nfor all formula_83, therefore formula_84 for all formula_85, and all formula_83. The proved vector space properties imply that formula_76 is a vector subspace of formula_10. Consider now the function formula_89 defined as\n\nwhere formula_91 is the usual formula_10 norm: it is easy to prove that this is a norm on formula_76. To see that formula_76 is complete respect to it, i.e. it is a Banach space, consider a Cauchy sequence formula_70 in formula_76. By definition it is also a Cauchy sequence in formula_10 and therefore has a limit formula_14 in formula_10: since formula_100 is bounded in formula_76 for each formula_102, then formula_103 by lower semicontinuity of the variation formula_104, therefore formula_14 is a \"BV\" function. Finally, again by lower semicontinuity, choosing an arbitrary small positive number formula_106\n\nFrom this we deduce that formula_104 is continuous because it's a norm.\n\nTo see this, it is sufficient to consider the following example belonging to the space formula_109: for each 0<\"α\"<1 define\nas the characteristic function of the left-closed interval formula_111. Then, choosing \"α,β\"∈formula_112 such that \"α\"≠\"β\" the following relation holds true:\nNow, in order to prove that every dense subset of formula_114 cannot be countable, it is sufficient to see that for every \"α\"∈formula_112 it is possible to construct the balls\nObviously those balls are pairwise disjoint, and also are an indexed family of sets whose index set is formula_112. This implies that this family has the cardinality of the continuum: now, since any dense subset of formula_109 must have at least a point inside each member of this family, its cardinality is at least that of the continuum and therefore cannot a be countable subset. This example can be obviously extended to higher dimensions, and since it involves only local properties, it implies that the same property is true also for formula_119.\n\nChain rules for nonsmooth functions are very important in mathematics and mathematical physics since there are several important physical models whose behavior is described by functions or functionals with a very limited degree of smoothness.The following version is proved in the paper : all partial derivatives must be intended in a generalized sense. i.e. as generalized derivatives\n\nTheorem. Let formula_120 be a function of class formula_30 (i.e. a continuous and differentiable function having continuous derivatives) and let formula_122 be a function in formula_76 with formula_8 being an open subset of formula_125.\nThen formula_126 and\n\nwhere formula_128 is the mean value of the function at the point formula_129, defined as\n\nA more general chain rule formula for Lipschitz continuous functions formula_131 has been found by Luigi Ambrosio and Gianni Dal Maso and is published in the paper . However, even this formula has very important direct consequences: choosing formula_132, where formula_133 is also a formula_134 function, the preceding formula gives the Leibniz rule for formula_134 functions\n\nThis implies that the product of two functions of bounded variation is again a function of bounded variation, therefore formula_76 is an algebra.\n\nThis property follows directly from the fact that formula_76 is a Banach space and also an associative algebra: this implies that if formula_139 and formula_140 are Cauchy sequences of formula_134 functions converging respectively to functions formula_142 and formula_14 in formula_76, then\n\ntherefore the ordinary product of functions is continuous in formula_76 with respect to each argument, making this function space a Banach algebra.\n\nIt is possible to generalize the above notion of total variation so that different variations are weighted differently. More precisely, let formula_147 be any increasing function such that formula_148 (the weight function) and let formula_149 be a function from the interval formula_150⊂ℝ taking values in a normed vector space formula_151. Then the formula_152-variation of formula_153 over formula_154 is defined as\n\nwhere, as usual, the supremum is taken over all finite partitions of the interval formula_154, i.e. all the finite sets of real numbers formula_157 such that\n\nThe original notion of variation considered above is the special case of formula_159-variation for which the weight function is the identity function: therefore an integrable function formula_153 is said to be a weighted \"BV\" function (of weight formula_161) if and only if its formula_159-variation is finite.\n\nThe space formula_164 is a topological vector space with respect to the norm\n\nwhere formula_166 denotes the usual supremum norm of \"formula_153\". Weighted \"BV\" functions were introduced and studied in full generality by Władysław Orlicz and Julian Musielak in the paper : Laurence Chisholm Young studied earlier the case formula_168 where \"formula_169\" is a positive integer.\n\nSBV functions \"i.e.\" \"Special functions of Bounded Variation\" were introduced by Luigi Ambrosio and Ennio de Giorgi in the paper , dealing with free discontinuity variational problems: given an open subset formula_8 of ℝ\"\", the space formula_171 is a proper linear subspace of formula_76, since the weak gradient of each function belonging to it consists precisely of the sum of an formula_102-dimensional support and an formula_65-dimensional support measure and \"no intermediate-dimensional terms\", as seen in the following definition.\n\nDefinition.

Conditional variances are important parts of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models.\n\nThe conditional variance of a random variable \"Y\" given another random variable \"X\" is \n\nThe conditional variance tells us how much variance is left if we use formula_2 to \"predict\" \"Y\".\nHere, as usual, formula_2 stands for the conditional expectation of \"Y\" given \"X\",\nwhich we may recall, is a random variable itself (a function of \"X\", determined up to probability one).\nAs a result, formula_4 itself is a random variable (and is a function of \"X\").\n\nRecall that variance is the expected squared deviation between a random variable (say, \"Y\") and its expected value. \nThe expected value can be thought of as a reasonable prediction of the outcomes of the random experiment (in particular, the expected value is the best constant prediction when predictions are assessed by expected squared prediction error). Thus, one interpretation of variance is that it gives the smallest possible expected squared prediction error. If we have the knowledge of another random variable (\"X\") that we can use to predict \"Y\", we can potentially use this knowledge to reduce the expected squared error. As it turns out, the best prediction of \"Y\" given \"X\" is the conditional expectation. In particular, for any formula_5 measurable,\n\nBy selecting formula_7, the second, nonnegative term becomes zero, showing the claim.\nHere, the second equality used the law of total expectation.\nWe also see that the expected conditional variance of \"Y\" given \"X\" shows up as the irreducible error of predicting \"Y\" given only the knowledge of \"X\".\n\nWhen \"X\" takes on countable many values formula_8 with positive probability, i.e., it is a discrete random variable, we can introduce formula_9, the conditional variance of \"Y\" given that \"X=x\" for any \"x\" from \"S\" as follows:\n\nwhere recall that formula_11 is the conditional expectation of \"Z\" given that \"X=x\", which is well-defined for formula_12.\nAn alternative notation for formula_9 is formula_14\n\nNote that here formula_9 defines a constant for possible values of \"x\", and in particular, formula_9, is \"not\" a random variable.\n\nThe connection of this definition to formula_4 is as follows:\nLet \"S\" be as above and define the function formula_18 as formula_19. Then, formula_20 almost surely.\n\nThe \"conditional expectation of \"Y\" given \"X=x\"\" can also be defined more generally\nusing the conditional distribution of \"Y\" given \"X\" (this exists in this case, as both here \"X\" and \"Y\" are real-valued).\n\nIn particular, letting formula_21 be the (regular) conditional distribution formula_21 of \"Y\" given \"X\", i.e., formula_23 (the intention is that formula_24 almost surely over the support of \"X\"), we can define\n\nformula_25\n\nThis can, of course, be specialized to when \"Y\" is discrete itself (replacing the integrals with sums), and also when the conditional density of \"Y\" given \"X=x\" with respect to some underlying distribution exists.\n\nThe law of total variance says\n\nformula_26\n\nIn words: the variance of \"Y\" is the sum of the expected conditional variance \"Y\" given \"X\" and the variance of the conditional expectation of \"Y\" given \"X\".

{"id": "657958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=657958", "title": "Cooperative game theory", "text": "Cooperative game theory\n\nIn game theory, a cooperative game (or coalitional game) is a game with competition between groups of players (\"coalitions\") due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperative behavior (e.g. through contract law). Those are opposed to non-cooperative games in which there is either no possibility to forge alliances or all agreements need to be self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats).\n\nCooperative games are often analysed through the framework of cooperative game theory, which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take and the resulting collective payoffs. It is opposed to the traditional non-cooperative game theory which focuses on predicting individual players' actions and payoffs and analyzing Nash equilibria.\n\nCooperative game theory provides a high-level approach as it only describes the structure, strategies and payoffs of coalitions, whereas non-cooperative game theory also looks at how bargaining procedures will affect the distribution of payoffs within each coalition. As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation. While it would thus be optimal to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework, in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available to the players during the strategic bargaining process, or the resulting model would be of too high complexity to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows the analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers.\n\nA cooperative game is given by specifying a value for every coalition. Formally, the coalitional game consists of a finite set of players formula_1, called the \"grand coalition\", and a \"characteristic function\" formula_2 from the set of all possible coalitions of players to a set of payments that satisfies formula_3. The function describes how much collective payoff a set of players can gain by forming a coalition, and the game is sometimes called a \"value game\" or a \"profit game\". \n\nConversely, a cooperative game can also be defined with a characteristic cost function formula_4 satisfying formula_5. In this setting, players must accomplish some task, and the characteristic function formula_6 represents the cost of a set of players accomplishing the task together. A game of this kind is known as a \"cost game\". Although most cooperative game theory deals with profit games, all concepts can easily be translated to the cost setting.\n\nThe \"Harsanyi dividend\" (named after John Harsanyi, who used it to generalize the Shapley value in 1963) identifies the surplus that is created by a coalition of players in a cooperative game. To specify this surplus, the worth of this coalition is corrected by the surplus that is already created by subcoalitions. To this end, the dividend formula_7 of coalition formula_8 in game formula_9 is recursively determined by\n\nformula_10\n\nAn explicit formula for the dividend is given by formula_11. The function formula_12 is also known as the Möbius inverse of formula_13. Indeed, we can recover formula_9 from formula_15 by help of the formula formula_16. \n\nHarsanyi dividends are useful for analyzing both games and solution concepts, e.g. the Shapley value is obtained by distributing the dividend of each coalition among its members, i.e., the Shapley value formula_17 of player formula_18 in game formula_9 is given by summing up a player's share of the dividends of all coalitions that she belongs to, formula_20.\n\nLet formula_21 be a profit game. The \"dual game\" of formula_21 is the cost game formula_23 defined as\n\nIntuitively, the dual game represents the opportunity cost for a coalition formula_25 of not joining the grand coalition formula_1. A dual profit game formula_27 can be defined identically for a cost game formula_6. A cooperative game and its dual are in some sense equivalent, and they share many properties. For example, the core of a game and its dual are equal. For more details on cooperative game duality, see for instance .\n\nLet formula_29 be a non-empty coalition of players. The \"subgame\" formula_30 on formula_25 is naturally defined as\n\nIn other words, we simply restrict our attention to coalitions contained in formula_25. Subgames are useful because they allow us to apply solution concepts defined for the grand coalition on smaller coalitions.\n\nCharacteristic functions are often assumed to be superadditive . This means that the value of a union of disjoint coalitions is no less than the sum of the coalitions' separate values:\n\nformula_34 whenever formula_35 satisfy formula_36.\n\nLarger coalitions gain more:\n\nformula_37. \n\nThis follows from superadditivity. i.e. if payoffs are normalized so singleton coalitions have zero value.\n\nA coalitional game is considered simple if payoffs are either 1 or 0, i.e. coalitions are either \"winning\" or \"losing\".\n\nEquivalently, a simple game can be defined as a collection of coalitions, where the members of are called winning coalitions, and the others losing coalitions.\nIt is sometimes assumed that a simple game is nonempty or that it does not contain an empty set. However, in other areas of mathematics, simple games are also called hypergraphs or Boolean functions (logic functions).\n\n\nA few relations among the above axioms have widely been recognized, such as the following\n(e.g., Peleg, 2002, Section 2.1):\n\n\nMore generally, a complete investigation of the relation among the four conventional axioms\n(monotonicity, properness, strongness, and non-weakness), finiteness, and algorithmic computability\nhas been made (Kumabe and Mihara, 2011),\nwhose results are summarized in the Table \"Existence of Simple Games\" below.\n\nThe restrictions that various axioms for simple games impose on their Nakamura number were also studied extensively. \nIn particular, a computable simple game without a veto player has a Nakamura number greater than 3 only if it is a \"proper\" and \"non-strong\" game.\n\nLet \"G\" be a strategic (non-cooperative) game. Then, assuming that coalitions have the ability to enforce coordinated behaviour, there are several cooperative games associated with \"G\". These games are often referred to as \"representations of G\". The two standard representations are:\n\n\nThe main assumption in cooperative game theory is that the grand coalition formula_1 will form. The challenge is then to allocate the payoff formula_53 among the players in some fair way. (This assumption is not restrictive, because even if players split off and form smaller coalitions, we can apply solution concepts to the subgames defined by whatever coalitions actually form.) A \"solution concept\" is a vector formula_54 that represents the allocation to each player. Researchers have proposed different solution concepts based on different notions of fairness. Some properties to look for in a solution concept include:\n\n\nAn efficient payoff vector is called a \"pre-imputation\", and an individually rational pre-imputation is called an imputation. Most solution concepts are imputations.\n\nThe stable set of a game (also known as the \"von Neumann-Morgenstern solution\" ) was the first solution proposed for games with more than 2 players. Let formula_21 be a game and let formula_68, formula_85 be two imputations of formula_21. Then formula_68 \"dominates\" formula_85 if some coalition formula_89 satisfies formula_90 and formula_91. In other words, players in formula_25 prefer the payoffs from formula_68 to those from formula_85, and they can threaten to leave the grand coalition if formula_85 is used because the payoff they obtain on their own is at least as large as the allocation they receive under formula_68.\n\nA \"stable set\" is a set of imputations that satisfies two properties:\n\n\nVon Neumann and Morgenstern saw the stable set as the collection of acceptable behaviours in a society: None is clearly preferred to any other, but for each unacceptable behaviour there is a preferred alternative. The definition is very general allowing the concept to be used in a wide variety of game formats.\n\n\nLet formula_21 be a game. The \"core\" of formula_21 is the set of payoff vectors\n\nIn words, the core is the set of imputations under which no coalition has a value greater than the sum of its members' payoffs. Therefore, no coalition has incentive to leave the grand coalition and receive a larger payoff.\n\n\nFor simple games, there is another notion of the core, when each player is assumed to have preferences on a set formula_102 of alternatives.\nA \"profile\" is a list formula_103 of individual preferences formula_104 on formula_102.\nHere formula_106 means that individual formula_18 prefers alternative formula_108\nto formula_109 at profile formula_110.\nGiven a simple game formula_9 and a profile formula_110, a \"dominance\" relation formula_113 is defined\non formula_102 by formula_115 if and only if there is a winning coalition formula_8\n(i.e., formula_117) satisfying formula_106 for all formula_119.\nThe \"core\" formula_120 of the simple game formula_9 with respect to the profile formula_110 of preferences\nis the set of alternatives undominated by formula_113\n(the set of maximal elements of formula_102 with respect to formula_113):\n\nThe \"Nakamura number\" of a simple game is the minimal number of winning coalitions with empty intersection.\n\"Nakamura's theorem\" states that the core formula_120 is nonempty for all profiles formula_110 of \"acyclic\" (alternatively, \"transitive\") preferences\nif and only if formula_102 is finite \"and\" the cardinal number (the number of elements) of formula_102 is less than the Nakamura number of formula_9.\nA variant by Kumabe and Mihara states that the core formula_120 is nonempty for all profiles formula_110 of preferences that have a \"maximal element\"\nif and only if the cardinal number of formula_102 is less than the Nakamura number of formula_9. (See Nakamura number for details.)\n\nBecause the core may be empty, a generalization was introduced in . The \"strong formula_138-core\" for some number formula_139 is the set of payoff vectors\n\nIn economic terms, the strong formula_138-core is the set of pre-imputations where no coalition can improve its payoff by leaving the grand coalition, if it must pay a penalty of formula_138 for leaving. Note that formula_138 may be negative, in which case it represents a bonus for leaving the grand coalition. Clearly, regardless of whether the core is empty, the strong formula_138-core will be non-empty for a large enough value of formula_138 and empty for a small enough (possibly negative) value of formula_138. Following this line of reasoning, the \"least-core\", introduced in , is the intersection of all non-empty strong formula_138-cores. It can also be viewed as the strong formula_138-core for the smallest value of formula_138 that makes the set non-empty .\n\nThe \"Shapley value\" is the unique payoff vector that is efficient, symmetric, and satisfies monotonicity. It was introduced by Lloyd Shapley who showed that it is the unique payoff vector that is efficient, symmetric, additive, and assigns zero payoffs to dummy players. The Shapley value of a superadditive game is individually rational, but this is not true in general. \n\nLet formula_2 be a game, and let formula_54 be an efficient payoff vector. The \"maximum surplus\" of player \"i\" over player \"j\" with respect to \"x\" is\n\nthe maximal amount player \"i\" can gain without the cooperation of player \"j\" by withdrawing from the grand coalition \"N\" under payoff vector \"x\", assuming that the other players in \"i\"'s withdrawing coalition are satisfied with their payoffs under \"x\". The maximum surplus is a way to measure one player's bargaining power over another. The \"kernel\" of formula_9 is the set of imputations \"x\" that satisfy\n\n\nfor every pair of players \"i\" and \"j\". Intuitively, player \"i\" has more bargaining power than player \"j\" with respect to imputation \"x\" if formula_156, but player \"j\" is immune to player \"i\"'s threats if formula_157, because he can obtain this payoff on his own. The kernel contains all imputations where no player has this bargaining power over another. This solution concept was first introduced in .\n\nLet formula_2 be a game, and let formula_54 be a payoff vector. The \"excess\" of formula_68 for a coalition formula_161 is the quantity formula_162; that is, the gain that players in coalition formula_25 can obtain if they withdraw from the grand coalition formula_1 under payoff formula_68 and instead take the payoff formula_166.\n\nNow let formula_167 be the vector of excesses of formula_68, arranged in non-increasing order. In other words, formula_169. Notice that formula_68 is in the core of formula_21 if and only if it is a pre-imputation and formula_172. To define the nucleolus, we consider the lexicographic ordering of vectors in formula_173: For two payoff vectors formula_174, we say formula_175 is lexicographically smaller than formula_176 if for some index formula_177, we have formula_178 and formula_179. (The ordering is called lexicographic because it mimics alphabetical ordering used to arrange words in a dictionary.) The \"nucleolus\" of formula_21 is the lexicographically minimal imputation, based on this ordering. This solution concept was first introduced in .\n\nAlthough the definition of the nucleolus seems abstract, gave a more intuitive description: Starting with the least-core, record the coalitions for which the right-hand side of the inequality in the definition of formula_181 cannot be further reduced without making the set empty. Continue decreasing the right-hand side for the remaining coalitions, until it cannot be reduced without making the set empty. Record the new set of coalitions for which the inequalities hold at equality; continue decreasing the right-hand side of remaining coalitions and repeat this process as many times as necessary until all coalitions have been recorded. The resulting payoff vector is the nucleolus.\n\n\nIntroduced by Shapley in , convex cooperative games capture the intuitive property some games have of \"snowballing\". Specifically, a game is \"convex\" if its characteristic function formula_21 is supermodular:\n\nIt can be shown (see, e.g., Section V.1 of ) that the supermodularity of formula_21 is equivalent to\n\nthat is, \"the incentives for joining a coalition increase as the coalition grows\" , leading to the aforementioned snowball effect. For cost games, the inequalities are reversed, so that we say the cost game is \"convex\" if the characteristic function is submodular.\n\nConvex cooperative games have many nice properties:\n\n\nSubmodular and supermodular set functions are also studied in combinatorial optimization. Many of the results in have analogues in , where submodular functions were first presented as generalizations of matroids. In this context, the core of a convex cost game is called the \"base polyhedron\", because its elements generalize base properties of matroids.\n\nHowever, the optimization community generally considers submodular functions to be the discrete analogues of convex functions , because the minimization of both types of functions is computationally tractable. Unfortunately, this conflicts directly with Shapley's original definition of supermodular functions as \"convex\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In fact, this is a very common and important issue since in many applications it is not possible to access noise-free data. Noise can interfere with the learning process at different levels: the algorithm may receive data that have been occasionally mislabeled, or the inputs may have some false information, or the classification of the examples may have been maliciously adulterated.\n\nIn the following, let formula_1 be our formula_2-dimensional input space. Let formula_3 be a class of functions that we wish to use in order to learn a formula_4-valued target function formula_5 defined over formula_1. Let formula_7 be the distribution of the inputs over formula_1. The goal of a learning algorithm formula_9 is to choose the best function formula_10 such that it minimizes formula_11. Let us suppose we have a function formula_12 that can measure the complexity of formula_5. Let formula_14 be an oracle that, whenever called, returns an example formula_15 and its correct label formula_16.\n\nWhen no noise corrupts the data, we can define learning in the Valiant setting:\n\nDefinition:\nWe say that formula_5 is efficiently learnable using formula_3 in the Valiant setting if there exists a learning algorithm formula_9 that has access to formula_14 and a polynomial formula_21 such that for any formula_22 and formula_23 it outputs, in a number of calls to the oracle bounded by formula_24 , a function formula_10 that satisfies with probability at least formula_26 the condition formula_27.\n\nIn the following we will define learnability of formula_5 when data have suffered some modification.\n\nIn the classification noise model a noise rate formula_29 is introduced. Then, instead of formula_30 that returns always the correct label of example formula_15, algorithm formula_32 can only call a faulty oracle formula_33 that will flip the label of formula_15 with probability formula_35. As in the Valiant case, the goal of a learning algorithm formula_9 is to choose the best function formula_10 such that it minimizes formula_11. In applications it is difficult to have access to the real value of formula_35, but we assume we have access to its upperbound formula_40. Note that if we allow the noise rate to be formula_41, then learning becomes impossible in any amount of computation time, because every label conveys no information about the target function.\n\nDefinition:\nWe say that formula_5 is efficiently learnable using formula_3 in the classification noise model if there exists a learning algorithm formula_9 that has access to formula_33 and a polynomial formula_21 such that for any formula_47, formula_48 and formula_49 it outputs, in a number of calls to the oracle bounded by formula_50 , a function formula_10 that satisfies with probability at least formula_26 the condition formula_27.\n\nStatistical Query Learning is a kind of active learning problem in which the learning algorithm formula_9 can decide if to request information about the likelihood formula_55 that a function formula_5 correctly labels example formula_15, and receives an answer accurate within a tolerance formula_58. Formally, whenever the learning algorithm formula_9 calls the oracle formula_60, it receives as feedback probability formula_61, such that formula_62.\n\nDefinition:\nWe say that formula_5 is efficiently learnable using formula_3 in the statistical query learning model if there exists a learning algorithm formula_9 that has access to formula_60 and polynomials formula_67, formula_68, and formula_69 such that for any formula_22 the following hold:\n\nNote that the confidence parameter formula_80 does not appear in the definition of learning. This is because the main purpose of formula_80 is to allow the learning algorithm a small probability of failure due to an unrepresentative sample. Since now formula_60 always guarantees to meet the approximation criterion formula_62, the failure probability is no longer needed.\n\nThe statistical query model is strictly weaker than the PAC model: any efficiently SQ-learnable class is efficiently PAC learnable in the presence of classification noise, but there exist efficient PAC-learnable problems such as parity that are not efficiently SQ-learnable.\n\nIn the malicious classification model an adversary generates errors to foil the learning algorithm. This setting describes situations of error burst, which may occur when for a limited time transmission equipment malfunctions repeatedly. Formally, algorithm formula_9 calls an oracle formula_85 that returns a correctly labeled example formula_15 drawn, as usual, from distribution formula_7 over the input space with probability formula_88, but it returns with probability formula_89 an example drawn from a distribution that is not related to formula_7. \nMoreover, this maliciously chosen example may strategically selected by an adversary who has knowledge of formula_5, formula_89, formula_7, or the current progress of the learning algorithm.\n\nDefinition:\nGiven a bound formula_94 for formula_95, we say that formula_5 is efficiently learnable using formula_3 in the malicious classification model, if there exist a learning algorithm formula_9 that has access to formula_85 and a polynomial formula_100 such that for any formula_22, formula_23 it outputs, in a number of calls to the oracle bounded by formula_103 , a function formula_10 that satisfies with probability at least formula_26 the condition formula_27.\n\nIn the nonuniform random attribute noise model the algorithm is learning a Boolean function, a malicious oracle formula_107 may flip each formula_108-th bit of example formula_109 independently with probability formula_110.\n\nThis type of error can irreparably foil the algorithm, in fact the following theorem holds:\n\nIn the nonuniform random attribute noise setting, an algorithm formula_9 can output a function formula_10 such that formula_113 only if formula_114.\n"}

Then he went to the university of Rome, where in 1941 he earned his laurea with magna cum laude under the direction of Mauro Picone, when he was only 19. He was immediately appointed by Picone as an assistant professor to his chair and as a researcher at the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo, becoming his pupil. After the war he went back to Rome working with Mauro Picone: in 1948 he became \"Libero Docente\" (free professor) of mathematical analysis and in 1949 he was appointed as full professor at the University of Trieste. As he remembers in , in both cases one of the members of the judging commission was Renato Caccioppoli, which become a close friend of him. From 1956 onward he was full professor at the University of Rome in the chair of mathematical analysis and then at the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica in the chair of higher analysis, succeeding to Luigi Fantappiè. He retired from university teaching in 1992, but was professionally very active until his death in 1996: particularly, as a member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei and first director of the journal \"Rendiconti Lincei – Matematica e Applicazioni\", he succeeded in reviving its reputation.\n\nHe was member of several academies, notably of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, the Accademia Nazionale delle Scienze detta dei XL and of the Russian Academy of Science.\n\nHis lifelong friendship with his teacher Mauro Picone is remembered by him in several occasions. As recalled by , his father Giuseppe was an assistant professor to the chair of Picone while he was teaching at the University of Catania: they become friends and their friendship lasted even when Giuseppe was forced to leave the academic career for economic reasons, being already the father of two sons, until Giuseppe's death. The young, in effect child, Gaetano, was kept by Picone in his arms. From 1939 to 1941 the young Fichera developed his research directly under the supervision of Picone: as he remembers, it was a time of intense work. But also, when he was back from the front in April 1945 he met Picone while he was in Roma in his way back to Sicily, and his advisor was so happy to see him as a father can be seeing its living child. Another mathematician Fichera was influenced by and acknowledged as one of his teachers and inspirators was Pia Nalli: she was an outstanding analyst, teaching for several years at the University of Catania, being his teacher of mathematical analysis from 1937 to 1939. Antonio Signorini and Francesco Severi were two of Fichera's teachers of the Roman period: the first one introduced him and inspired his research in the field of linear elasticity while the second inspired his research in the field he taught him i.e. the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables. Signorini had a strong long-time friendship with Picone: on a wall of the apartment building where they lived, in Via delle Tre Madonne, 18 in Rome, a memorial tablet which commemorates the two friends is placed, as recalls. The two great mathematicians extended their friendship to the young Fichera, and as a consequence this led to the solution of the Signorini problem and the foundation of the theory of variational inequalities. Fichera's relations with Severi were not as friendly as with Signorini and Picone: nevertheless, Severi, which was one of the most influential Italian mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century, esteemed the young mathematician. During a course on the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables taught at the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica from the fall of 1956 and the beginning of the 1957, whose lectures were collected in the book , Severi posed the problem of generalizing his theorem on the Dirichlet problem for holomorphic function of several variables, as recalls: the result was the paper , which is a masterpiece, although not generally acknowledged for various reasons described by . Other scientists he had as teachers during the period 1939–1941 were Enrico Bompiani, Leonida Tonelli and Giuseppe Armellini: he remembered them with great respect and admiration, even if he did not share all their opinions and ideas, as recalls.\n\nA complete list of Fichera's friends includes some of the best scientists and mathematicians of the 20th century: Olga Oleinik, Olga Ladyzhenskaya, Israel Gel'fand, Ivan Petrovsky, Vladimir Maz'ya, Nikoloz Muskhelishvili, Ilia Vekua, Richard Courant, Fritz John, Kurt Friedrichs, Peter Lax, Louis Nirenberg, Ronald Rivlin, Hans Lewy, Clifford Truesdell, Edmund Hlawka, Ian Sneddon, Jean Leray, Alexander Weinstein, Alexander Ostrowski, Renato Caccioppoli, Solomon Mikhlin, Paul Naghdi, Marston Morse were among his friends, scientific collaborators and correspondents, just to name a few. He built up such a network of contacts being invited several times to lecture on his research by various universities and research institutions, and also participating to several academic conferences, always upon invitation. This long series of scientific journeys started in 1951, when he went to the USA together with his master and friend Mauro Picone and Bruno de Finetti in order to examine the capabilities and characteristics of the first electronic computers and purchase one for the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo: the machine they advised to purchase was the first computer ever working in Italy. The most complete source about his friends and collaborators is the book by his wife Matelda: in those reference it is also possible to find a fairly complete description of Gaetano Fichera's scientific journeys.\n\nThe close friendship between Angelo Pescarini and Fichera has not his roots in their scientific interests: it is another war story. As recalls, Gaetano, being escaped from Verona and hidden in a convent in Alfonsine, tried to get in touch with the local group of partisans in order to help the people of that town who had been so helpful with him: they were informed about an assistant professor to the chair of higher analysis in Rome who was trying to reach them. Angelo, which was a student of mathematics at the University of Bologna under Gianfranco Cimmino, a former pupil of Mauro Picone, was charged of the task of testing the truth of Gaetano's assertions, examining him in mathematics: his question was:– \"Mi sai dire una condizione sufficiente per scambiare un limite con un integrale (Can you give me a sufficient condition for interchanging limit and integration)?\"–. Gaetano quickly answered:– \"Non solo ti darò la condizione sufficiente, ma ti darò anche la condizione necessaria e pure per insiemi non limitati (I can give you not only a sufficient condition, but also a necessary condition, and not only for bounded domains, but also for unbounded domains)\"–. In effect, Fichera proved such a theorem in the paper , his latest paper written in while he was in Rome before joining the army: from that moment on he often used to joke saying that good mathematicians can always have a good application, even for saving one's life.\n\nOne of his best friends and appreciated scientific collaborator was Olga Arsenievna Oleinik: she cured the redaction of his last posthumous paper , as recalls. Also, she used to discuss his work with Gaetano, as he did with her: sometimes their discussion become lively, but nothing more, since they were extremely good friends and estimators of each one's work.\n\nHe is the author of more than 250 papers and 18 books (monographs and course notes): his work concerns mainly the fields of pure and applied mathematics listed below. A common characteristic to all of his research is the use of the methods of functional analysis to prove existence, uniqueness and approximation theorems for the various problems he studied, and also a high consideration of the analytic problems related to problems in applied mathematics.\n\nHis work in elasticity theory includes the paper , where Fichera proves the \"Fichera's maximum principle\", his work on variational inequalities. The work on this last topic started with the paper , where he announced the existence and uniqueness theorem for the Signorini problem, and ended with the following one , where the full proof was published: those papers are the founding works of the field of variational inequalities, as remarked by Stuart Antman in . Concerning the Saint-Venant's principle, he was able to prove it using a variational approach and a slight variation of a technique employed by Richard Toupin to study the same problem: in the paper there is a complete proof of the principle under the hypothesis that the base of the cylinder is a set with piecewise smooth boundary. Also he is known for his researches in the theory of hereditary elasticity: the paper emphasizes the necessity of analyzing very well the constitutive equations of materials with memory in order to introduce models where an existence and uniqueness theorems can be proved in such a way that the proof does not rely on an implicit choice of the topology of the function space where the problem is studied. At last, it is worth to mention that Clifford Truesdell invited him to write the contributions and for Siegfried Flügge's \"Handbuch der Physik\".\n\nHe was one of the pioneers in the development of the abstract approach through functional analysis in order to study general boundary value problems for linear partial differential equations proving in the paper a theorem similar in spirit to the Lax–Milgram theorem. He studied deeply the mixed boundary value problem i.e. a boundary value problem where the boundary has to satisfy a mixed boundary condition: in his first paper on the topic, , he proves the first existence theorem for the mixed boundary problem for self-adjoint operators of variables, while in the paper he proves the same theorem dropping the hypothesis of self-adjointness. He is, according to , the founder of the theory of partial differential equations of non-positive characteristics: in the paper he introduced the now called Fichera's function, in order to identify subsets of the boundary of the domain where the boundary value problem for such kind of equations is posed, where it is necessary or not to specify the boundary condition: another account of the theory can be found in the paper , which is written in English and was later translated in Russian and Hungarian.\n\nHis contributions to the calculus of variation are mainly devoted to the proof of existence and uniqueness theorems for maxima and minima of functionals of particular form, in conjunction with his studies on variational inequalities and linear elasticity in theoretical and applied problems: in the paper a semicontinuity theorem for a functional introduced in the same paper is proved in order to solve the Signorini problem, and this theorem was extended in to the case where the given functional has general linear operators as arguments, not necessarily partial differential operators.\n\nIt is difficult to single out his contributions to functional analysis since, as stated at the beginning of this section, the methods of functional analysis are ubiquitous in his research: however, it is worth to remember paper , where an important existence theorem is proved.\n\nHis contributions in the field of eigenvalue theory began with the paper , where he formalizes a method developed by Mauro Picone for the approximation of eigenvalues of operators subject only to the condition that their inverse is compact: however, as he admits in , this method does not give any estimate on the approximation error on the value of the calculated (approximated) eigenvalues.\n\nHe contributed also to the classical eigenvalue problem for symmetric operators, introducing the method of orthogonal invariants.\n\nHis work in this field is mainly related to the study of systems of functions, possibly being particular solutions of a given partial differential equation or system of such equations, in order to prove their completeness on the boundary of a given domain. The interest of this research is obvious: given such a system of functions, every solution of a boundary value problem can be approximated by an infinite series or Fourier type integral in the topology of a given function space. One of the most famous examples of this kind of theorem is Mergelyan's theorem, which completely solves the problem in the class of holomorphic functions for a compact set in the complex plane. In his paper , Fichera studies this problem for harmonic functions, relaxing the smoothness requirements on the boundary in the already cited work : a survey on his and others' work in this area, including contributions of Mauro Picone, Bernard Malgrange, Felix Browder and a number of other mathematicians, is contained in the paper . Another branch of his studies on approximation theory is strictly tied to complex analysis in one variable, and to the already cited Mergelyan's theorem: he studied the problem of approximating continuous functions on a compact set (and analytic on its interior if this is non void) of the complex plane by rational functions with prescribed poles, simple or not. The paper surveys the contribution to the solution of this and related problems by Sergey Mergelyan, Lennart Carleson, Gábor Szegő as well as others, including his own.\n\nHis contributions to potential theory are very important. The results of his paper occupy paragraph 24 of chapter II of the textbook , as remarked by in . Also, his researches and on the asymptotic behaviour of the electric field near singular points of the conducting surface, widely known among the specialists (as several works of V.G. Maz'ya, S.A. Nazarov, B.A. Plamenevsky, B.W. Schulze and others testify) can be included in between his works in potential theory.\n\nHis main contributions to those topics and are the papers and . In the first one he proves that a condition on a sequence of integrable functions previously introduced by Mauro Picone is both necessary and sufficient in order to assure that limit process and the integration process commute, both in bounded and unbounded domains: the theorem is similar in spirit to the dominated convergence theorem, which however only states a sufficient condition. The second paper contains an extension of the Lebesgue's decomposition theorem to finitely additive measures: this extension required him to generalize the Radon–Nikodym derivative, requiring it to be a set function belonging to a given class and minimizing a particular functional.\n\nHe contributed to both the classical topic of complex analysis in one variable and the more recent one of complex analysis in several variables. His contributions to complex analysis in one variable are essentially approximation results, well described in the survey paper . In the field of functions of several complex variables, his contributions were outstanding, but also not generally acknowledged. Precisely, in the paper he solved the Dirichlet problem for holomorphic function of several variables under the hypothesis that the boundary of the domain has a Hölder continuous normal vector (i.e. it belongs to the class) and the Dirichlet boundary condition is a function belonging to the Sobolev space satisfying the weak form of the tangential Cauchy–Riemann condition, extending a previous result of Francesco Severi: this theorem and the Lewy–Kneser theorem on the local Cauchy problem for holomorphic functions of several variables, laid the foundations of the theory of CR-functions. Another important result is his proof in of an extension of Morera's theorem to functions of several complex variables, under the hypothesis that the given function is only locally integrable: previous proofs under more restrictive assumptions were given by Francesco Severi in and Salomon Bochner in . He also studied the properties of the real part and imaginary part of functions of several complex variables, i.e. pluriharmonic functions: starting from the paper he gives a trace condition analogous to the tangential Cauchy–Riemann condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for pluriharmonic functions in the paper , and generalizes a theorem of Luigi Amoroso to the complex vector space for complex variables in the paper . Also he was able to prove that an integro-differential equation defined on the boundary of a smooth domain by Luigi Amoroso in his cited paper, the Amoroso integro-differential equation, is a necessary and sufficient condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for pluriharmonic functions when this domain is the sphere in .\n\nHis contributions to the theory of exterior differential forms started as a war story: having read a famous memoir of Enrico Betti (where Betti numbers were introduced) just before joining the army, he used this knowledge in order to develop a theory of exterior differential forms while he was kept prisoner in Teramo jail. When he was back in Rome in 1945, he discussed his discovery with Enzo Martinelli, who very tactfully informed him that the idea was already developed by mathematicians Élie Cartan and Georges de Rham. However, he continued work on this theory, contributing with several papers, and also advised all of his students to study it, despite from the fact of being an analyst, as he remarks: his main results are collected in the papers and . In the first one he introduced -measures, a concept less general than currents but easier to work with: his aim was to clarify the analytic structure of currents and to prove all relevant results of the theory i.e. the three theorems of de Rham and Hodge theorem on harmonic forms in a simpler, more analytic way. In the second one he developed an abstract Hodge theory, following the axiomatic method, proving an abstract form of Hodge theorem.\n\nAs noted in the \"Functional analysis and eigenvalue theory\" section, his main \"direct\" contribution to the field of numerical analysis is the introduction of the method of orthogonal invariants for the calculus of eigenvalues of symmetric operators: however, as already remarked, it is hard to find something in his works which is not related to applications. His works on partial differential equations and linear elasticity have always a constructive aim: for example, the results of paper , which deals with the asymptotic analysis of the potential, were included in the book and led to the definition of the as a standard benchmark problem for numerical methods. Another example of his work on quantitative problems is the interdisciplinary study , surveyed in , where methods of mathematical analysis and numerical analysis are applied to a problem posed by biological sciences.\n\nhis work in this field occupy all the volume . He wrote bibliographical sketches for a number of mathematicians, both teachers, friends and collaborators, including Mauro Picone, Luigi Fantappiè, Pia Nalli, Maria Adelaide Sneider, Renato Caccioppoli, Solomon Mikhlin, Francesco Tricomi, Alexander Weinstein, Aldo Ghizzetti. His historical works contain several observations against the so-called historical revisitation: the meaning of this concept is clearly stated in the paper . He identifies with the word revisitation the analysis of historical facts basing only on modern conceptions and points of view: this kind of analysis differs from the \"true\" historical one since it is heavily affected by the historian's point of view. The historian applying this kind of methodology to history of mathematics, and more generally to the history of science, emphasizes the sources that have led a field to its modern shape, neglecting the efforts of the pioneers.\n\nHis teaching activity was almost as intense as his research activity: he also was a pioneer in encouraging gifted women to choose a career in mathematical research, as recalls. An almost complete list of his doctoral students is reported below:\n\nA selection of Gaetano Fichera's works was published respectively by the Unione Matematica Italiana and the Accademia Pontaniana in his \"opere scelte\" and in the volume . These two references include most of the papers listed in this section: however, these volumes does not include his monographs and textbooks, as well as several survey papers on various topic pertaining to his fields of research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the four-color theorem, every graph that can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings can have its vertices colored using at most four different colors, so that the two endpoints of every edge have different colors, but according to Grötzsch's theorem only three colors are needed for planar graphs that do not contain three mutually-adjacent vertices.\n\nThe theorem is named after German mathematician Herbert Grötzsch, who published its proof in 1959.\nGrötzsch's original proof was complex. attempted to simplify it but his proof was erroneous.\n\nIn 2003, Carsten Thomassen derived an alternative proof from another related theorem: every planar graph with girth at least five is 3-list-colorable. However, Grötzsch's theorem itself does not extend from coloring to list coloring: there exist triangle-free planar graphs that are not 3-list-colorable. In 1989, Richard Steinberg and\nDan Younger gave the first correct proof, in English, of the dual version of this theorem. In 2012, Nabiha Asghar gave a new and much simpler proof of the theorem that is inspired by Thomassen's work.\n\nA slightly more general result is true: if a planar graph has at most three triangles then it is 3-colorable. However, the planar complete graph \"K\", and infinitely many other planar graphs containing \"K\", contain four triangles and are not 3-colorable. In 2009, Dvořák, Kráľ, and Thomas announced a proof of another generalization, conjectured in 1969 by L. Havel: there exists a constant \"d\" such that, if a planar graph has no two triangles within distance \"d\" of each other, then it can be colored with three colors. This work formed part of the basis for Dvořák's 2015 European Prize in Combinatorics.\n\nThe theorem cannot be generalized to all nonplanar triangle-free graphs: not every nonplanar triangle-free graph is 3-colorable. In particular, the Grötzsch graph and the Chvátal graph are triangle-free graphs requiring four colors, and the Mycielskian is a transformation of graphs that can be used to construct triangle-free graphs that require arbitrarily high numbers of colors.\n\nThe theorem cannot be generalized to all planar \"K\"-free graphs, either: not every planar graph that requires 4 colors contains \"K\". In particular, there exists a planar graph without 4-cycles that cannot be 3-colored.\n\nA 3-coloring of a graph \"G\" may be described by a graph homomorphism from \"G\" to a triangle \"K\". In the language of homomorphisms, Grötzsch's theorem states that every triangle-free planar graph has a homomorphism to \"K\".\nNaserasr showed that every triangle-free planar graph also has a homomorphism to the Clebsch graph, a 4-chromatic graph.\nBy combining these two results, it may be shown that every triangle-free planar graph has a homomorphism to a triangle-free 3-colorable graph, the tensor product of \"K\" with the Clebsch graph.\nThe coloring of the graph may then be recovered by composing this homomorphism with the homomorphism from this tensor product to its \"K\" factor.\nHowever, the Clebsch graph and its tensor product with \"K\" are both non-planar; there does not exist a triangle-free planar graph to which every other triangle-free planar graph may be mapped by a homomorphism.\n\nA result of combines Grötzsch's theorem with Scheinerman's conjecture on the representation of planar graphs as intersection graphs of line segments. They proved that every triangle-free planar graph can be represented by a collection of line segments, with three slopes, such that two vertices of the graph are adjacent if and only if the line segments representing them cross. A 3-coloring of the graph may then be obtained by assigning two vertices the same color whenever their line segments have the same slope.\n\nGiven a triangle-free planar graph, a 3-coloring of the graph can be found in linear time.\n\n"}

{"id": "705749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=705749", "title": "Intersection homology", "text": "Intersection homology\n\nIn topology, a branch of mathematics, intersection homology is an analogue of singular homology especially well-suited for the study of singular spaces, discovered by Mark Goresky and Robert MacPherson in the fall of 1974 and developed by them over the next few years.\n\nIntersection cohomology was used to prove the Kazhdan–Lusztig conjectures and the Riemann–Hilbert correspondence. It is closely related to \"L\" cohomology.\n\nThe homology groups of a compact, oriented, \"n\"-dimensional manifold \"X\" have a fundamental property called Poincaré duality: there is a perfect pairing\n\nClassically—going back, for instance, to Henri Poincaré—this duality was understood in terms of intersection theory. An element of\n\nis represented by a \"j\"-dimensional cycle. If an \"i\"-dimensional and an (\"n\" − \"i\")-dimensional cycle are in general position, then their intersection is a finite collection of points. Using the orientation of \"X\" one may assign to each of these points a sign; in other words intersection yields a \"0\"-dimensional cycle. One may prove that the homology class of this cycle depends only on the homology classes of the original \"i\"- and (\"n\" − \"i\")-dimensional cycles; one may furthermore prove that this pairing is perfect.\n\nWhen \"X\" has \"singularities\"—that is, when the space has places that do not look like formula_3—these ideas break down. For example, it is no longer possible to make sense of the notion of \"general position\" for cycles. Goresky and MacPherson introduced a class of \"allowable\" cycles for which general position does make sense. They introduced an equivalence relation for allowable cycles (where only \"allowable boundaries\" are equivalent to zero), and called the group\n\nof \"i\"-dimensional allowable cycles modulo this equivalence relation \"intersection homology\". They furthermore showed that the intersection of an \"i\"- and an (\"n\" − \"i\")-dimensional allowable cycle gives an (ordinary) zero-cycle whose homology class is well-defined.\n\nIntersection homology was originally defined on suitable spaces with a stratification, though the groups often turn out to be independent of the choice of stratification. There are many different definitions of stratified spaces. A convenient one for intersection homology is an \"n\" -dimensional topological pseudomanifold. This is a (paracompact, Hausdorff) space \"X\" that has a filtration\n\nof \"X\" by closed subspaces such that:\n\n\nIf \"X\" is a topological pseudomanifold, the \"i\"-dimensional stratum of \"X\" is the space \"X\" − \"X\".\n\nExamples:\n\nIntersection homology groups IH(\"X\") depend on a choice of perversity \"p\", which measures how far cycles are allowed to deviate from transversality. (The origin of the name \"perversity\" was explained by .)\nA perversity \"p\" is a function from integers ≥2 to integers such that\n\nThe second condition is used to show invariance of intersection homology groups under change of stratification.\n\nThe complementary perversity \"q\" of \"p\" is the one with\n\nIntersection homology groups of complementary dimension and complementary perversity are dually paired.\n\nExamples:\n\nFix a topological pseudomanifold \"X\" of dimension \"n\" with some stratification, and a perversity \"p\".\n\nA map σ from the standard \"i\"-simplex Δ to \"X\" (a singular simplex) is called allowable if\n\nis contained in the \"i\" − \"k\" + \"p\"(\"k\") skeleton of Δ.\n\nThe complex \"I\"(\"X\") is a subcomplex of the complex of singular chains on \"X\" that consists of all singular chains such that both the chain and its boundary are linear combinations of allowable singular simplexes. The singular intersection homology groups (with perversity \"p\")\nare the homology groups of this complex.\n\nIf \"X\" has a triangulation compatible with the stratification, then simplicial intersection homology groups can be defined in a similar way, and are naturally isomorphic to the singular intersection homology groups.\n\nThe intersection homology groups are independent of the choice of stratification of \"X\".\n\nIf \"X\" is a topological manifold, then the intersection homology groups (for any perversity) are the same as the usual homology groups.\n\nA resolution of singularities\nof a complex variety \"Y\" is called a small resolution if for every \"r\" > 0, the space of points of \"Y\" where the fiber has dimension \"r\" is of codimension greater than 2\"r\".

Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman credit it to S. Rao Kosaraju and Micha Sharir—Kosaraju suggested it in 1978 but did not publish it, while Sharir independently discovered it and published it in 1981. It makes use of the fact that the transpose graph (the same graph with the direction of every edge reversed) has exactly the same strongly connected components as the original graph.\n\nThe primitive graph operations that the algorithm uses are to enumerate the vertices of the graph, to store data per vertex (if not in the graph data structure itself, then in some table that can use vertices as indices), to enumerate the out-neighbours of a vertex (traverse edges in the forward direction), and to enumerate the in-neighbours of a vertex (traverse edges in the backward direction); however the last can be done without, at the price of constructing a representation of the transpose graph during the forward traversal phase. The only additional data structure needed by the algorithm is an ordered list \"L\" of graph vertices, that will grow to contain each vertex once.\n\nIf strong components are to be represented by appointing a separate root vertex for each component, and assigning to each vertex the root vertex of its component, then Kosaraju's algorithm can be stated as follows.\nTrivial variations are to instead assign a component number to each vertex, or to construct per-component lists of the vertices that belong to it. The unvisited/visited indication may share storage location with the final assignment of root for a vertex.\n\nThe key point of the algorithm is that during the first (forward) traversal of the graph edges, vertices are prepended to the list \"L\" in post-order relative to the search tree being explored. This means it does not matter whether a vertex \"v\" was first Visited because it appeared in the enumeration of all vertices or because it was the out-neighbour of another vertex \"u\" that got Visited; either way \"v\" will be prepended to \"L\" before \"u\" is, so if there is a forward path from \"u\" to \"v\" then \"u\" will appear before \"v\" on the final list \"L\" (unless \"u\" and \"v\" both belong to the same strong component, in which case their relative order in \"L\" is arbitrary). As given above, the algorithm for simplicity employs depth-first search, but it could just as well use breadth-first search as long as the post-order property is preserved.\n\nThe algorithm can be understood as identifying the strong component of a vertex \"u\" as the set of vertices which are reachable from \"u\" both by backwards and forwards traversal. Writing formula_1 for the set of vertices reachable from formula_2 by forward traversal, formula_3 for the set of vertices reachable from formula_2 by backwards traversal, and formula_5 for the set of vertices which appear strictly before formula_2 on the list \"L\" after phase 2 of the algorithm, the strong component containing a vertex formula_2 appointed as root is\nSet intersection is computationally costly, but it is logically equivalent to a double set difference, and since formula_9 it becomes sufficient to test whether a newly encountered element of formula_3 has already been assigned to a component or not.\n\nProvided the graph is described using an adjacency list, Kosaraju's algorithm performs two complete traversals of the graph and so runs in Θ(V+E) (linear) time, which is asymptotically optimal because there is a matching lower bound (any algorithm must examine all vertices and edges). It is the conceptually simplest efficient algorithm, but is not as efficient in practice as Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm, which perform only one traversal of the graph.\n\nIf the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, the algorithm requires \"Ο(V)\" time.\n\n\n"}

This allows one to use element-wise diagram chasing proofs in these categories. The theorem is named after Barry Mitchell and Peter Freyd.\n\nThe precise statement is as follows: if A is a small abelian category, then there exists a ring \"R\" (with 1, not necessarily commutative) and a full, faithful and exact functor \"F\": A → \"R\"-Mod (where the latter denotes the category of all left \"R\"-modules).\n\nThe functor \"F\" yields an equivalence between A and a full subcategory of \"R\"-Mod in such a way that kernels and cokernels computed in A correspond to the ordinary kernels and cokernels computed in \"R\"-Mod. Such an equivalence is necessarily additive.\nThe theorem thus essentially says that the objects of A can be thought of as \"R\"-modules, and the morphisms as \"R\"-linear maps, with kernels, cokernels, exact sequences and sums of morphisms being determined as in the case of modules. However, projective and injective objects in A do not necessarily correspond to projective and injective \"R\"-modules.\n\nLet formula_1 be the category of left exact functors from the abelian category formula_2 to the category of abelian groups formula_3. First we construct a contravariant embedding formula_4 by formula_5 for all formula_6, where formula_7 is the covariant hom-functor, formula_8. The Yoneda Lemma states that formula_9 is fully faithful and we also get the left exactness of formula_9 very easily because formula_7 is already left exact. The proof of the right exactness of formula_9 is harder and can be read in Swan, \"Lecture Notes in Mathematics 76\".\n\nAfter that we prove that formula_13 is an abelian category by using localization theory (also Swan). This is the hard part of the proof.\n\nIt is easy to check that the abelian category formula_13 is an AB5 category with a generator \nformula_15.\nIn other words it is a Grothendieck category and therefore has an injective cogenerator formula_16.\n\nThe endomorphism ring formula_17 is the ring we need for the category of \"R\"-modules.\n\nBy formula_18 we get another contravariant, exact and fully faithful embedding formula_19 The composition formula_20 is the desired covariant exact and fully faithful embedding.\n\nNote that the proof of the Gabriel–Quillen embedding theorem for exact categories is almost identical.\n\n"}

By rescaling we make this minimum value 1.\n\nSuch patterns fall in two categories, the two 1D space groups or line groups.\n\nIn the simpler case the only isometries of R which map the pattern to itself are translations; this applies, e.g., for the pattern \n\nEach isometry can be characterized by an integer, namely plus or minus the translation distance.

Thus the actual symmetry group contains elements of the form \"gag\"= \"b\", which is a conjugate of \"a\".\n\nFor a homogeneous “pattern” the symmetry group contains all translations, and reflection in all points. The symmetry group is isomorphic to Dih(R).\n\nThere are also less trivial patterns/functions with translational symmetry for arbitrarily small translations, e.g. the group of translations by rational distances. Even apart from scaling and shifting, there are infinitely many cases, e.g. by considering rational numbers of which the denominators are powers of a given prime number.\n\nThe translations form a group of isometries.

The image of this map is the orbit of \"x\" and the coimage is the set of all left cosets of \"G\". The standard quotient theorem of set theory then gives a natural bijection between \"G\"/\"G\" and \"Gx\". Specifically, the bijection is given by \"hG\" |-> \"h\" · \"x\". This result is known as the orbit-stabilizer theorem.

If any total ordering of \"X\" is fixed, the parity (oddness or evenness) of a permutation formula_1 of \"X\" can be defined as the parity of the number of inversions for σ, i.e., of pairs of elements of \"X\" such that formula_2 and formula_3.\n\nThe sign or signature or signum of a permutation σ is denoted sgn(σ) and defined as +1 if σ is even and −1 if σ is odd. The signature defines the alternating character of the symmetric group \"S\". Another notation for the sign of a permutation is given by the more general Levi-Civita symbol (formula_4), which is defined for all maps from \"X\" to \"X\", and has value zero for non-bijective maps.\n\nThe sign of a permutation can be explicitly expressed as\nwhere \"N\"(σ) is the number of inversions in σ.\n\nAlternatively, the sign of a permutation σ can be defined from its decomposition into the product of transpositions as\nwhere is the number of transpositions in the decomposition.

This shows that the given permutation σ is odd. Following the method of the cycle notation article, this could be written as\nThere are many other ways of writing σ as a composition of transpositions, for instance\nbut it is impossible to write it as a product of an even number of transpositions.\n\nThe identity permutation is an even permutation. An even permutation can be obtained as the composition of an even number and only an even number of exchanges (called transpositions) of two elements, while an odd permutation can be obtained by (only) an odd number of transpositions.\n\nThe following rules follow directly from the corresponding rules about addition of integers:\nFrom these it follows that\n\nConsidering the symmetric group \"S\" of all permutations of the set {1, ..., }, we can conclude that the map\nthat assigns to every permutation its signature is a group homomorphism.\n\nFurthermore, we see that the even permutations form a subgroup of \"S\". This is the alternating group on letters, denoted by \"A\". It is the kernel of the homomorphism sgn. The odd permutations cannot form a subgroup, since the composite of two odd permutations is even, but they form a coset of \"A\" (in \"S\").\n\nIf  > 1 , then there are just as many even permutations in \"S\" as there are odd ones; consequently, \"A\" contains !/2 permutations. [The reason: if σ is even, then is odd; if σ is odd, then is even; the two maps are inverse to each other.]\n\nA cycle is even if and only if its length is odd. This follows from formulas like\nIn practice, in order to determine whether a given permutation is even or odd, one writes the permutation as a product of disjoint cycles. The permutation is odd if and only if this factorization contains an odd number of even-length cycles.\n\nAnother method for determining whether a given permutation is even or odd is to construct the corresponding permutation matrix and compute its determinant. The value of the determinant is the same as the parity of the permutation.\n\nEvery permutation of odd order must be even. The permutation (12)(34) in \"A\" shows that the converse is not true in general.\n\nEvery permutation can be produced by a sequence of transpositions (2-element exchanges): with the first transposition we put the first element of the permutation in its proper place, the second transposition puts the second element right etc. Since we cannot be left with just a single element in an incorrect position, we must achieve the permutation with our last transposition. Given a permutation σ, we can write it as a product of transpositions in many different ways. We want to show that either all of those decompositions have an even number of transpositions, or all have an odd number.\n\nSuppose we have two such decompositions: \nWe want to show that \"k\" and \"m\" are either both even, or both odd.\n\nEvery transposition can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions of adjacent elements, e.g.\n\nTo see this, note that if we have the transposition (\"i\" \"j\") on an \"n\"-element set {1...,\"i\"...,\"j\"...,\"n\"}, one way to decompose it is as [(\"j\" − 1 j)(\"j\" − 2 \"j\" − 1) ... (\"i\" + 1 \"i\" + 2)][(\"i\" + 1 \"i\")(\"i\" + 2 \"i\" + 1) ... (\"j\" \"j\" − 1)]. The right block of transpositions first frees up the \"j\" space by moving \"j\" over to the \"j\" − 1 space; then, \"j\" − 1 goes into the \"j\" − 2 space with \"j\" − 2 in the \"j\" space, \"j\" − 2 goes into the \"j\" − 3 space with \"j\" − 3 in the \"j\" space, etc., until \"i\" + 1 ends up in the \"i\" space and \"i\" in the \"j\" space. Thus, each element from \"i\" + 1 to \"j\" − 1 is in a space one to the left from where it ought to be. In the left block, each of those elements is restored one at a time to its original space, after resting in the \"i\" space for the duration of one permutation. \"j\" ends up in the \"i\" space, and \"i\" in the \"j\" space, with nothing else altered, as desired. The number of transpositions is (\"j\" − \"i\") + (j − \"i\" − 1), which is clearly odd.\n\nIf we decompose in this way each of the transpositions \"T\" ... \"T\" and \"Q\" ... \"Q\" above\ninto an odd number of adjacent transpositions, we get the new decompositions:\nwhere all of the \"T*\"...\"T*\" \"Q*\"...\"Q*\" are adjacent, \"k\" − \"k\"′ is even, and \"m\" − \"m\"′ is even.\n\nNow compose the inverse of T* (which happens to be the same permutation) with σ. \"T*\" is the transposition (\"i\", \"i\" + 1) of two adjacent numbers, so, compared to σ, the new permutation σ (\"i\", \"i\" + 1) will have exactly one inversion pair less (in case (\"i\", \"i\" + 1) was an inversion pair for σ) or more (in case (\"i\", \"i\" + 1) was not an inversion pair). Then apply the inverses of \"T*\", \"T*\", ..., \"T\"* in the same way, \"unraveling\" the permutation \"σ\". At the end we get the identity permutation, whose \"N\" (see above) is zero. This means that the original \"N\"(\"σ\") less \"k\"' is even and also \"N\"(\"σ\") less \"k\" is even (addition modulo two is independent of sign).\n\nWe can do the same thing with the other decomposition, \"Q*\"...\"Q\"*, and it will turn out that the original \"N\"(\"σ\") less \"m\" is even.\n\nTherefore, \"m\" − \"k\" is even, as we wanted to show.\n\nWe can thus define the parity of \"σ\" to be that of its number of constituent transpositions, because we see that this can have only one value. And this must agree with the parity of the number of inversions under any ordering, as seen above, so the definitions are indeed well-defined and equivalent.\n\nAn alternative proof uses the polynomial\n\nSo for instance in the case  = 3, we have\n\nNow for a given permutation σ of the numbers {1, ..., }, we define\n\nSince the polynomial formula_10 has the same factors as formula_11 except for their signs, if follows that sgn(σ) is either +1 or −1. Furthermore, if σ and τ are two permutations, we see that\n\nSince with this definition it is furthermore clear that any transposition of two elements has signature −1, we do indeed recover the signature as defined earlier.\n\nA third approach uses the presentation of the group \"S\" in terms of generators formula_13 and relations\n[Here the generator formula_17 represents the transposition (\"i\", \"i\" + 1).] All relations keep the length of a word the same or change it by two. Starting with an even-length word will thus always result in an even-length word after using the relations, and similarly for odd-length words. It is therefore unambiguous to call the elements of \"S\" represented by even-length words \"even\", and the elements represented by odd-length words \"odd\".\n\nRecall that a pair formula_18 such that formula_19 and formula_20 is called an inverse. We want to show that the count of inverses has the same parity as the count of 2-element swaps. To do that, we can show that every swap changes the parity of the count of inverses, no matter which two elements are being swapped and what permutation has already been applied. \nSuppose we want to swap the formula_21th and the formula_22th element. Clearly, inverses formed by formula_21 or formula_22 with an element outside of formula_25 will not be affected. \nFor the formula_26elements within formula_27, assume formula_28 of them form inverses with formula_21 and formula_30 of them form inverses with formula_22. If formula_21 and formula_22 are swapped, those formula_28 inverses with formula_21 are gone, but formula_36 inverses are formed. The count of inverses formula_21 gained is thus formula_38, which has the same parity as formula_39. \nSimilarly, the count of inverses formula_22 gained also has the same parity as formula_39. Therefore, the count of inverses gained by both combined has the same parity as formula_42 or formula_43. Now if we count the inverse gained (or lost) by swapping the formula_21th and the formula_22th element, we can see that this swap changes the parity of the count of inverses. \nNote that initially when no swap is applied, the count of inverses is 0. Now we obtain equivalence of the two definitions of parity of a permutation.\n\nThe parity of a permutation of formula_39 points is also encoded in its cycle structure.\n\nLet formula_47 be the unique decomposition of formula_1 into disjoint cycles, which can be composed in any order because they commute. A cycle formula_49 involving formula_50 points can always be obtained by composing formula_51 transpositions (2-cycles):\n\nso call formula_51 the \"size\" of the cycle, and observe that, under this definition, transpositions are cycles of size 1. From a decomposition into formula_54 disjoint cycles we can obtain a decomposition of formula_1 into formula_56 transpositions, where formula_57 is the size of the th cycle. The number formula_58 is called the discriminant of formula_1, and can also be computed as\n\nif we take care to include the fixed points of formula_1 as 1-cycles.\n\nSuppose a transposition formula_62 is applied after a permutation formula_1. When formula_64 and formula_65 are in different cycles of formula_1 then\n\nand if formula_64 and formula_65 are in the same cycle of formula_1 then\n\nIn either case, it can be seen that formula_72, so the parity of formula_73 will be different from the parity of formula_74.\n\nIf formula_75 is an arbitrary decomposition of a permutation formula_1 into transpositions, by applying the formula_77 transpositions formula_78 after formula_79 after ... after formula_80 after the identity (whose formula_81 is zero) observe that formula_74 and formula_77 have the same parity. By defining the parity of formula_1 as the parity of formula_74, a permutation that has an even length decomposition is an even permutation and a permutation that has one odd length decomposition is an odd permutation.\n\nRemarks:\n\nParity can be generalized to Coxeter groups: one defines a length function formula_93 which depends on a choice of generators (for the symmetric group, adjacent transpositions), and then the function formula_94 gives a generalized sign map.\n\n\n"}

A set equipped with an equivalence relation or a partition is sometimes called a setoid, typically in type theory and proof theory.\n\nA partition of a set \"X\" is a set of nonempty subsets of \"X\" such that every element \"x\" in \"X\" is in exactly one of these subsets (i.e., \"X\" is a disjoint union of the subsets).\n\nEquivalently, a family of sets \"P\" is a partition of \"X\" if and only if all of the following conditions hold:\n\nThe sets in \"P\" are called the \"blocks\", \"parts\" or \"cells\" of the partition.\n\nThe rank of \"P\" is |\"X\"| − |\"P\"|, if \"X\" is finite.\n\n\nFor any equivalence relation on a set \"X\", the set of its equivalence classes is a partition of \"X\". Conversely, from any partition \"P\" of \"X\", we can define an equivalence relation on \"X\" by setting precisely when \"x\" and \"y\" are in the same part in \"P\". Thus the notions of equivalence relation and partition are essentially equivalent.\n\nThe axiom of choice guarantees for any partition of a set \"X\" the existence of a subset of \"X\" containing exactly one element from each part of the partition. This implies that given an equivalence relation on a set one can select a canonical representative element from every equivalence class.\n\nA partition \"α\" of a set \"X\" is a refinement of a partition \"ρ\" of \"X\"—and we say that \"α\" is \"finer\" than \"ρ\" and that \"ρ\" is \"coarser\" than \"α\"—if every element of \"α\" is a subset of some element of \"ρ\". Informally, this means that \"α\" is a further fragmentation of \"ρ\". In that case, it is written that \"α\" ≤ \"ρ\".\n\nThis \"finer-than\" relation on the set of partitions of \"X\" is a partial order (so the notation \"≤\" is appropriate). Each set of elements has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound, so that it forms a lattice, and more specifically (for partitions of a finite set) it is a geometric lattice. The \"partition lattice\" of a 4-element set has 15 elements and is depicted in the Hasse diagram on the left.\n\nBased on the cryptomorphism between geometric lattices and matroids, this lattice of partitions of a finite set corresponds to a matroid in which the base set of the matroid consists of the atoms of the lattice, namely, the partitions with formula_6 singleton sets and one two-element set. These atomic partitions correspond one-for-one with the edges of a complete graph. The matroid closure of a set of atomic partitions is the finest common coarsening of them all; in graph-theoretic terms, it is the partition of the vertices of the complete graph into the connected components of the subgraph formed by the given set of edges. In this way, the lattice of partitions corresponds to the lattice of flats of the graphic matroid of the complete graph.\n\nAnother example illustrates the refining of partitions from the perspective of equivalence relations. If \"D\" is the set of cards in a standard 52-card deck, the \"same-color-as\" relation on \"D\" – which can be denoted ~ – has two equivalence classes: the sets {red cards} and {black cards}. The 2-part partition corresponding to ~ has a refinement that yields the \"same-suit-as\" relation ~, which has the four equivalence classes {spades}, {diamonds}, {hearts}, and {clubs}.\n\nA partition of the set \"N\" = {1, 2, ..., \"n\"} with corresponding equivalence relation ~ is noncrossing if it has the following property: If four elements \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" and \"d\" of \"N\" having \"a\" < \"b\" < \"c\" < \"d\" satisfy \"a\" ~ \"c\" and \"b\" ~ \"d\", then \"a\" ~ \"b\" ~ \"c\" ~ \"d\". The name comes from the following equivalent definition: Imagine the elements 1, 2, ..., \"n\" of \"N\" drawn as the \"n\" vertices of a regular \"n\"-gon (in counterclockwise order). A partition can then be visualized by drawing each block as a polygon (whose vertices are the elements of the block). The partition is then noncrossing if and only if these polygons do not intersect.\n\nThe lattice of noncrossing partitions of a finite set has recently taken on importance because of its role in free probability theory. These form a subset of the lattice of all partitions, but not a sublattice, since the join operations of the two lattices do not agree.\n\nThe total number of partitions of an \"n\"-element set is the Bell number \"B\". The first several Bell numbers are \"B\" = 1,\n\"B\" = 1, \"B\" = 2, \"B\" = 5, \"B\" = 15, \"B\" = 52, and \"B\" = 203 . Bell numbers satisfy the recursion\n\nand have the exponential generating function\n\nThe Bell numbers may also be computed using the Bell triangle\nin which the first value in each row is copied from the end of the previous row, and subsequent values are computed by adding two numbers, the number to the left and the number to the above left of the position. The Bell numbers are repeated along both sides of this triangle. The numbers within the triangle count partitions in which a given element is the largest singleton.\n\nThe number of partitions of an \"n\"-element set into exactly \"k\" nonempty parts is the Stirling number of the second kind \"S\"(\"n\", \"k\").\n\nThe number of noncrossing partitions of an \"n\"-element set is the Catalan number \"C\", given by\n\n\n"}

A point source has negligible extent, distinguishing it from other source geometries. Sources are called point sources because in mathematical modeling, these sources can usually be approximated as a mathematical point to simplify analysis.\n\nThe actual source need not be physically small, if its size is negligible relative to other length scales in the problem. For example, in astronomy, stars are routinely treated as point sources, even though they are in actuality much larger than the Earth.\n\nIn three dimensions, the density of something leaving a point source decreases in proportion to the inverse square of the distance from the source, if the distribution is isotropic, and there is no absorption or other loss.\n\nIn mathematics, a point source is a singularity from which flux or flow is emanating. Although singularities such as this do not exist in the observable universe, mathematical point sources are often used as approximations to reality in physics and other fields.\n\nGenerally, a source of light can be considered a point source if the resolution of the imaging instrument is too low to resolve the source's apparent size.\nThere are two types and sources of light. A point source, and an extended source.\n\nMathematically an object may be considered a point source if its angular size, formula_1, is much smaller than the resolving power of the telescope:\nformula_2,\nwhere formula_3 is the wavelength of light and formula_4 is the telescope diameter.\n\nExamples:\n\nRadio wave sources which are smaller than one radio wavelength are also generally treated as point sources. Radio emissions generated by a fixed electrical circuit are usually polarized, producing anisotropic radiation. If the propagating medium is lossless, however, the radiant power in the radio waves at a given distance will still vary as the inverse square of the distance if the angle remains constant to the source polarization.\n\nGamma ray and X-ray sources may be treated as a point source if sufficiently small. Radiological contamination and nuclear sources are often point sources. This has significance in health physics and radiation protection.\n\nExamples:\n\nSound is an oscillating pressure wave. As the pressure oscillates up and down, an audio point source acts in turn as a fluid point source and then a fluid point sink. (Such an object does not exist physically, but is often a good simplified model for calculations.)\n\nExamples:\n\nPoint sources are used as a means of calibrating ionizing radiation instruments. They are usually a sealed capsule and are most commonly used for gamma, x-ray and beta measuring instruments.\n\nIn vacuum, heat escapes as radiation isotropically. If the source remains stationary in a compressible fluid such as air, flow patterns can form around the source due to convection, leading to an anisotropic pattern of heat loss. The most common form of anisotropy is the formation of a thermal plume above the heat source.\nExamples:\n\nFluid point sources are commonly used in fluid dynamics and aerodynamics. A point source of fluid is the inverse of a fluid point sink (a point where fluid is removed). Whereas fluid sinks exhibit complex rapidly changing behaviour such as is seen in vortices (for example water running into a plug-hole or tornadoes generated at points where air is rising), fluid sources generally produce simple flow patterns, with stationary isotropic point sources generating an expanding sphere of new fluid. If the fluid is moving (such as wind in air or currents in water) a plume is generated from the point source.\n\nExamples:\n\nSources of various types of pollution are often considered as point sources in large-scale studies of pollution.\n\n"}
{"id": "23582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23582", "title": "Preorder", "text": "Preorder\n\nIn mathematics, especially in order theory, a preorder or quasiorder is a binary relation that is reflexive and transitive. Preorders are more general than equivalence relations and (non-strict) partial orders, both of which are special cases of a preorder. An antisymmetric preorder is a partial order, and a symmetric preorder is an equivalence relation.\n\nThe name 'preorder' comes from the idea that preorders (that are not partial orders) are 'almost' (partial) orders, but not quite; they are neither necessarily anti-symmetric nor asymmetric. Because a preorder is a binary relation, the symbol ≤ can be used as the notational device for the relation. However, because they are not necessarily anti-symmetric, some of the ordinary intuition associated to the symbol ≤ may not apply. On the other hand, a preorder can be used, in a straightforward fashion, to define a partial order and an equivalence relation. Doing so, however, is not always useful or worthwhile, depending on the problem domain being studied.\n\nIn words, when \"a\" ≤ \"b\", one may say that \"b\" \"covers\" \"a\" or that \"a\" \"precedes\" \"b\", or that \"b\" \"reduces\" to \"a\". Occasionally, the notation ← or formula_1 is used instead of ≤.\n\nTo every preorder, there corresponds a directed graph, with elements of the set corresponding to vertices, and the order relation between pairs of elements corresponding to the directed edges between vertices. The converse is not true: most directed graphs are neither reflexive nor transitive. In general, the corresponding graphs may contain cycles. A preorder that is antisymmetric no longer has cycles; it is a partial order, and corresponds to a directed acyclic graph. A preorder that is symmetric is an equivalence relation; it can be thought of as having lost the direction markers on the edges of the graph. In general, a preorder's corresponding directed graph may have many disconnected components.\n\nConsider some set \"P\" and a binary relation ≤ on \"P\". Then ≤ is a preorder, or quasiorder, if it is reflexive and transitive, i.e., for all \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" in \"P\", we have that:\n\nA set that is equipped with a preorder is called a preordered set (or proset).\n\nIf a preorder is also antisymmetric, that is, \"a\" ≤ \"b\" and \"b\" ≤ \"a\" implies \"a\" = \"b\", then it is a partial order.\n\nOn the other hand, if it is symmetric, that is, if \"a\" ≤ \"b\" implies \"b\" ≤ \"a\", then it is an equivalence relation.\n\nEquivalently, the notion of a preordered set \"P\" can be formulated in a categorical framework as a thin category, i.e. as a category with at most one morphism from an object to another. Here the objects correspond to the elements of \"P\", and there is one morphism for objects which are related, zero otherwise. Alternately, a preordered set can be understood as an enriched category, enriched over the category 2 = (0→1).\n\nA preordered class is a class equipped with a preorder. Every set is a class and so every preordered set is a preordered class.\n\n\nIn computer science, one can find examples of the following preorders.\n\nExample of a total preorder:\n\nPreorders play a pivotal role in several situations:\n\nEvery binary relation R on a set S can be extended to a preorder on S by taking the transitive closure and reflexive closure, R. The transitive closure indicates path connection in R: \"x\" R \"y\" if and only if there is an R-path from \"x\" to y.\n\nGiven a preorder formula_7 on S one may define an equivalence relation ~ on S such that \"a\" ~ \"b\" if and only if \"a\" formula_7 \"b\" and \"b\" formula_7 \"a\". (The resulting relation is reflexive since a preorder is reflexive, transitive by applying transitivity of the preorder twice, and symmetric by definition.)\n\nUsing this relation, it is possible to construct a partial order on the quotient set of the equivalence, S / ~, the set of all equivalence classes of ~. Note that if the preorder is R, S / ~ is the set of R-cycle equivalence classes: \"x\" ∈ [\"y\"] if and only if \"x\" = \"y\" or \"x\" is in an R-cycle with y. In any case, on S / ~ we can define [\"x\"] ≤ [\"y\"] if and only if \"x\" formula_7 \"y\". By the construction of ~, this definition is independent of the chosen representatives and the corresponding relation is indeed well-defined. It is readily verified that this yields a partially ordered set.\n\nConversely, from a partial order on a partition of a set S one can construct a preorder on S. There is a 1-to-1 correspondence between preorders and pairs (partition, partial order).\n\nFor a preorder \"formula_7\", a relation \"<\" can be defined as \"a\" < \"b\" if and only if (\"a\" formula_7 \"b\" and not \"b\" formula_7 \"a\"), or equivalently, using the equivalence relation introduced above, (\"a\" formula_7 \"b\" and not \"a\" ~ \"b\"). It is a strict partial order; every strict partial order can be the result of such a construction. If the preorder is anti-symmetric, hence a partial order \"≤\", the equivalence is equality, so the relation \"<\" can also be defined as \"a\" < \"b\" if and only if (\"a\" ≤ \"b\" and \"a\" ≠ \"b\").\n\nConversely we have \"a\" formula_7 \"b\" if and only if \"a\" < \"b\" or \"a\" ~ \"b\". This is the reason for using the notation \"formula_7\"; \"≤\" can be confusing for a preorder that is not anti-symmetric, it may suggest that \"a\" ≤ \"b\" implies that \"a\" < \"b\" or \"a\" = \"b\".\n\nNote that with this construction multiple preorders \"formula_7\" can give the same relation \"<\", so without more information, such as the equivalence relation, \"formula_7\" cannot be reconstructed from \"<\". Possible preorders include the following:\n\nGiven a binary relation formula_23, the complemented composition formula_24 forms a preorder called the left residual, where formula_25 denotes the converse relation of formula_23, and formula_27 denotes the complement relation of formula_23, while formula_29 denotes relation composition.\n\nAs explained above, there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between preorders and pairs (partition, partial order). Thus the number of preorders is the sum of the number of partial orders on every partition. For example:\n\nFor \"a\" formula_7 \"b\", the interval [\"a\",\"b\"] is the set of points \"x\" satisfying \"a\" formula_7 \"x\" and \"x\" formula_7 \"b\", also written \"a\" formula_7 \"x\" formula_7 \"b\". It contains at least the points \"a\" and \"b\". One may choose to extend the definition to all pairs (\"a\",\"b\"). The extra intervals are all empty.\n\nUsing the corresponding strict relation \"<\", one can also define the interval (\"a\",\"b\") as the set of points \"x\" satisfying \"a\" < \"x\" and \"x\" < \"b\", also written \"a\" < \"x\" < \"b\". An open interval may be empty even if \"a\" < \"b\".\n\nAlso [\"a\",\"b\") and (\"a\",\"b\"] can be defined similarly.\n\n\n"}

The first fundamental form of the surface in these coordinates has a special form\n\nwhere formula_5 expresses the angle between the asymptotic lines, and for the second fundamental form, \"L\" = \"N\" = 0. Then the Codazzi–Mainardi equation expressing a compatibility condition between the first and second fundamental forms results in the sine-Gordon equation. The study of this equation and of the associated transformations of pseudospherical surfaces in the 19th century by Bianchi and Bäcklund led to the discovery of Bäcklund transformations.\n\nThe name \"sine-Gordon equation\" is a pun on the well-known Klein–Gordon equation in physics:\n\nThe sine-Gordon equation is the Euler–Lagrange equation of the field whose Lagrangian density is given by\n\nUsing the Taylor series expansion of the cosine in the Lagrangian,\n\nit can be rewritten as the Klein–Gordon Lagrangian plus higher order terms\n\nAn interesting feature of the sine-Gordon equation is the existence of soliton and multisoliton solutions.\n\nThe sine-Gordon equation has the following 1-soliton solutions:\n\nwhere\n\nand the slightly more general form of the equation is assumed:\n\nThe 1-soliton solution for which we have chosen the positive root for formula_13 is called a \"kink\", and represents a twist in the variable formula_14 which takes the system from one solution formula_15 to an adjacent with formula_16. The states formula_17 are known as vacuum states as they are constant solutions of zero energy. The 1-soliton solution in which we take the negative root for formula_13 is called an \"antikink\". The form of the 1-soliton solutions can be obtained through application of a Bäcklund transform to the trivial (constant vacuum) solution and the integration of the resulting first-order differentials:\n\nfor all time.\n\nThe 1-soliton solutions can be visualized with the use of the elastic ribbon sine-Gordon model as discussed by \"Dodd and co-workers\". Here we take a clockwise (left-handed) twist of the elastic ribbon to be a kink with topological charge formula_21. The alternative counterclockwise (right-handed) twist with topological charge formula_22 will be an antikink.\n\nMulti-soliton solutions can be obtained through continued application of the Bäcklund transform to the 1-soliton solution, as prescribed by a Bianchi lattice relating the transformed results. The 2-soliton solutions of the sine-Gordon equation show some of the characteristic features of the solitons. The traveling sine-Gordon kinks and/or antikinks pass through each other as if perfectly permeable, and the only observed effect is a phase shift. Since the colliding solitons recover their velocity and shape such kind of interaction is called an elastic collision.\n\nAnother interesting 2-soliton solutions arise from the possibility of coupled kink-antikink behaviour known as a \"breather\". There are known three types of breathers: \"standing breather\", \"traveling large amplitude breather\", and \"traveling small amplitude breather\".\n\n3-soliton collisions between a traveling kink and a standing breather or a traveling antikink and a standing breather results in a phase shift of the standing breather. In the process of collision between a moving kink and a standing breather,\nthe shift of the breather formula_23 is given by:\n\nwhere formula_25 is the velocity of the kink, and formula_26 is the breather's frequency. If the old position of the standing breather is formula_27, after the collision the new position will be formula_28.\n\nThe following video shows a simulation of two parking solitons. Both send out a pressure-speed field with different polarity. Because the end of the 1D space is not termicated symmetricly - waves are reflected.\n\nLines in the video:\n\n1) Cos() part of the soliton.\n2) Sin() part of the soliton.\n3) Angle acceleration of the soliton.\n4) Pressure-Component of the field with different polarity.\n5) Speed-Component of the field - direction dependent.\n\nSteps:\n\n1) Solitons send out not bound energy as waves.\n2) Solitons send the p-v-field which reaches the peer.\n3) Solitons begin to move.\n4) They meet in the middle and annihilate.\n5) Mass is spread as wave.\n\nThe is given by\n\nThis is the Euler–Lagrange equation of the Lagrangian\n\nAnother closely related equation is the elliptic sine-Gordon equation, given by\n\nwhere formula_14 is now a function of the variables \"x\" and \"y\". This is no longer a soliton equation, but it has many similar properties, as it is related to the sine-Gordon equation by the analytic continuation (or Wick rotation) \"y\" = i\"t\".\n\nThe elliptic sinh-Gordon equation may be defined in a similar way.\n\nA generalization is given by Toda field theory.\n\nIn quantum field theory the sine-Gordon model contains a parameter that can be identified with the Planck constant. The particle spectrum consists of a soliton, an anti-soliton and a finite (possibly zero) number of breathers. The number of the breathers depends on the value of the parameter. Multi particle productions cancels on mass shell. Vanishing of two into four amplitude was explicitly checked in one loop approximation.\n\nSemi-classical quantization of the sine-Gordon model was done by Ludwig Faddeev and Vladimir Korepin. The exact quantum scattering matrix was discovered by Alexander Zamolodchikov.\nThis model is S-dual to the Thirring model.\n\nOne can also consider the sine-Gordon model on a circle, on a line segment, or on a half line. It is possible to find boundary conditions which preserve the integrability of the model. On a half line the spectrum contains boundary bound states in addition to the solitons and breathers.\n\nA supersymmetric extension of the sine-Gordon model also exists. Integrability preserving boundary conditions for this extension can be found as well.\n\n\n"}

On 27 August 1976, he calculated the 73rd root of a 500-digit number in 2 minutes and 43 seconds. This feat was recorded by the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nWim Klein was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands on 4 December 1912 to Henry Klein, GP, and Emma Cohen. Klein had a rough childhood because his father wanted him to become a Doctor (as his father was), even though he was quite opposed to the idea. In addition to this pressure, his mother also committed suicide in 1929. In 1932, when Klein finished High School, despite wanting badly to pursue his love of mathematics, he gave in to his father's demands and enrolled at the University of Amsterdam for Medicine; he succeeded in getting his bachelor's degree in 1935.\n\nWhen his father died in 1937, he initially continued with the path his father wanted, passing the first part of his doctoral exam, however he eventually gave up. Although he did not officially drop out of the doctoral program, he did not study any more and was therefore unable to advance. It was around this time that he discovered his homosexuality. Both Klein and his older brother Leo were regularly examined by a neurologist in Amsterdam, BB Stokvis, for their incredible computing capabilities. Stokvis labeled Wim as a \"auditory calculator,\" and his brother Leo as a \"visual calculator.\"\n\nWhen the Germans invaded in May 1940, Klein began working in a Jewish hospital and continued with his doctoral studies in 1941. In 1942, though, he had to hide, especially since his brother was captured and taken to the Sobibór extermination camp, where he would eventually die. After the war, Klein returned to his doctoral studies, but he also worked in circuses in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, performing fast calculations as an act, often under the stage name 'Pascal'. He lived a fairly nomadic lifestyle and performed in such shows until 1952, when his skills went to a more serious use.\n\nIn 1952, Klein was hired by the Mathematisch Centrum (English: Mathematical Center) in Amsterdam as a scientific calculator (Note that computers were only beginning to be developed, so calculations could be much more quickly and reliably done by a human like Klein). In 1954, the International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Amsterdam, so he attended. This inspired him to do shows again, so he went back to his nomadic lifestyle and performed internationally again for a few years until he was hired by CERN in 1958. This officially marked an end to his nomadic lifestyle. He was initially a great help to the physicists at CERN, but as computers became more powerful in the 1960s and physicists began programming more, Klein was more often used as a mascot for CERN who would do calculations for visitors. This disheartened him to the point where he would often say that Switzerland (the location of CERN) is a beautiful country, but it's a shame there are so many Swiss people living there (\"Een mooi land. Alleen jammer dat er zoveel Zwitsers wonen,\" in Dutch). CERN often still recognizes him as their first computer though.\n\nIn 1975, the commemoration of the seven hundredth anniversary of the settlement of Amsterdam made him feel homesick, so in 1976, Klein retired early from CERN. He continued to do calculations for show, this time with the stage name 'Willy Wortel,' although this time he started to become more interested in breaking records, trying hard to improve his time and beat new records. This continued until 1 August 1986, when Klein's housekeeper found him dead in his home in Amsterdam, brutally murdered with a knife. Although a young man was arrested, there was no evidence of his involvement in the case and he was soon released. The murder remains unsolved to this day.\n\n\n"}

It is named after Alfred Young, who, in a series of papers \"On quantitative substitutional analysis,\" developed representation theory of the symmetric group. In Young's theory, the objects now called Young diagrams and the partial order on them played a key, even decisive, role. Young's lattice prominently figures in algebraic combinatorics, forming the simplest example of a differential poset in the sense of . It is also closely connected with the crystal bases for affine Lie algebras.\n\nYoung's lattice is a partially ordered set \"Y\" formed by all integer partitions ordered by inclusion of their Young diagrams (or Ferrers diagrams).\n\nThe traditional application of Young's lattice is to the description of the irreducible representations of symmetric groups \"S\" for all \"n\", together with their branching properties, in characteristic zero. The equivalence classes of irreducible representations may be parametrized by partitions or Young diagrams, the restriction from \"S\" to \"S\" is multiplicity-free, and the representation of \"S\" with partition \"p\" is contained in the representation of \"S\" with partition \"q\" if and only if \"q\" covers \"p\" in Young's lattice. Iterating this procedure, one arrives at \"Young's semicanonical basis\" in the irreducible representation of \"S\" with partition \"p\", which is indexed by the standard Young tableaux of shape \"p\".\n\n\nConventionally, Young's lattice is depicted in a Hasse diagram with all elements of the same rank shown at the same height above the bottom.\n\nThe partition\n\nof the \"n\"th triangular number has a Ferrers diagram that looks like a staircase. The largest elements whose Ferrers diagrams are rectangular that lie under the staircase are these:\n\nPartitions of this form are the only ones that have only one element immediately below them in Young's lattice. Suter showed that the set of all elements less than or equal to these particular partitions has not only the bilateral symmetry that one expects of Young's lattice, but also rotational symmetry: the rotation group of order \"n\" + 1 acts on this poset. Since this set has both bilateral symmetry and rotational symmetry, it must have dihedral symmetry: the (\"n\" + 1)th dihedral group acts faithfully on this set. The size of this set is 2.\n\nFor example, when \"n\" = 4, then the maximal element under the \"staircase\" that have rectangular Ferrers diagrams are\n\nThe subset of Young's lattice lying below these partitions has both bilateral symmetry and 5-fold rotational symmetry. Hence the dihedral group \"D\" acts faithfully on this subset of Young's lattice.\n\n\n"}
